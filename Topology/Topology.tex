\item Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space with the property that every subset is closed.  Prove that it is a discrete space.

\begin{align*}
	S \subseteq X \implies X\backslash X \text{ is open } \implies X\backslash S \in \TT \\
	T \in \TT \implies X\backslash T \text{ is closed} \implies T \subseteq X
\end{align*}

\item Observe that if $(X,\TT)$ is a discrete space or an indiscrete space, then every opne set is a clopen set.  Find a topology $\TT$ on the set $X=\{a,b,c,d\}$ which is not discrete and is not indiscrete but has the property that every open set is clopen.

Let $\TT = \{X, \emptyset, \{a\}, \{b,c,d\}\}$

\item Let $X$ be an infinite set.  If $\TT$ is a topology on $X$ such that every infinite subset of $X$ is closed, prove that $\TT$ is the discrete topology.

\begin{align*}
	S \subseteq X \text{ and } |S| = \infty\\
	| X\backslash S | < \infty \implies X\backslash S \text{ is open}\\
\end{align*}there are an infinite number of finite subsets whose compliment is infinite and closed.  These are precisely what make up a discrete topology.

\item Let $X$ be an infinite set and $\TT$ a topology on $X$ with the property that the only infinite subset of $X$ which is open is $X$ itself.  Is $(X,\TT)$ necessarily an indiscrete space?

\item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item Let $\TT$ be a topology on a set $X$ such that $\TT$ consists of precisely for sets; that is, $\TT = \{X,\emptyset, A,B\}$, where $A$ and $B$ are non-empty distinct proper subsets of $X$.  [$A$ is a \textbf{\textit{proper subset}} of $X$ means that $A \subseteq X$ and $A \ne X$.  This si denoted by $A\subset X$.]  Prove that $A$ and $B$ must satisfy exactly one of the following conditions.
	\begin{center}
	(a) $B=X\backslash A;$    (b) $A \subset B$;    (c) $B\subset A$;	
	\end{center}
[Hint. Firstly show that $A$ and $B$ must satisfy at least one of the conditions and then show that they cannot satisfy more than one of the conditions.]

\item Using (i) list all topologies on $X =\{1,2,3,4\}$ which consist of exactly four sets.
	
\end{enumerate}

\item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item A recorded in \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_topological_space}, the number of distinct topologies on a set with $n \in \N$ points can be very large even for small $n$; namely when $n =2$, there are 4 topologies;  when $n=3$, there are 29 topologies:  when $n=4$, there are 355 topologies;  when $n=5$, there are 6942 topologies etc.  Using mathematical induction, prove that as $n$ increases the number of topologies increases.\\
%	[Hint. It suffices to show that if a set with $n$ points has $M$ distinct topolgies, then a set with $n+1$ points has at least $M+1$ topologies.]
	
	\item Using mathematical induction prove that if the finite set $X$ has $n \in \N$ then it has at least $(n-1)!$ distinct topolgies.\\
%	[Hint. Let $X = \{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ and $Y=\{x_1,\dots, x_n,x_{n+1}\}$.  If $\TT$ is any topologyon $X$, fix an $i \in \{1,2,\dots,n\}.$  Definte a topology $\TT_i$ on $Y$ as follows: For each open set $U \in \TT$, definte $U_i$ by replacign any occurrence of $x_i$ in $U$ by $x_{n+1}$; then $\TT_i$ consists of all $U_i$ plus the set $Y$.  Verify that $\TT_i$ is indeed a topology on $y$.  Deduce that for each topology on $X$, there are at least $n$ distinct topologies on $Y$.]
	
	\item If $X$ is any infintie set of cardinality $\mathfrak{N}$, prove that there are at least $2^\mathfrak{N}$ distinct topologies on $X$.  Deduce that every infinite set has an uncountable number of distinct topolgies on it.
	%[Hint. Prove that there are at least $2^\mathfrak{N}$ distinct topologies with precisely 3 open sets.  For an introduction to cardinal numbers, see Appendix 1.]

\end{align} and 
\begin{align}
	f^{-1}\left( B_1 \bigcap B_2\right) = f^{-1}(B_1)\cap f^{-1}(B_2)

	\item Prove that (1.2) is true.
	\item Find (concrete) sets $A_1,A_2, X$, and $Y$ and a function $f: X \to Y$ such that $f(A_1\cap A_2)\ne f(A_1)\cap f(A_2)$, where $A_1 \subseteq X$ and $A_2 \subseteq X$.

	\item Exercise 1.1 \#5 (iii)
	
	$\TT_3$ consists of $\R, \emptyset$, and every interval $[n,\infty)$, for $n$ any positive integer, where $[n,\infty)$ denotes the set $\{x \in\R:n\le x\};$
	
	\item Exercise 1.1 \#6 (i)
	
	$\TT_1$ consists of $\N, \emptyset$, and every set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, for $n$ any positive integer. (This is called \textbf{\textit{initial segment topology}}).
	
	\item Exercise 1.1 \#6 (ii)
	
	$\TT_2$ consists of $\N,\emptyset$, and every $\{n, n+1, \dots\}$, for $n$ any positive integer. (This is called the \textbf{\textit{final segment topology}}.)
	
\end{enumerate}

\item Let $\TT$ be the finite-closed topology on a set $X$.  If $\TT$ is also the discrete topology, prove that the set $X$ is finite.

\SPECIAL{$T_0$-space and the Sierpinsi Space}

\item A topological space $(X,\TT)$ is said to be a \textbf{$T_0$-space} if for each pair of distinct points $a,b$ in $X$, either there exist an open seet containing $a$ and not $b$, or there exists an open set containing $b$ and not $a$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item Prove that every $T_1$-space is a $T_0$-space.
	\item Which of $(i)-(iv)$ in Exercise 3 above are $T_0$-spaces?
	\item Put a topology $\TT$ on the set $X=\{0,1\}$ so that $(X,\TT)$ will be a $T_0$-space but not a $T_1$-space. [known as the \textbf{Sierpinski space}.]
	\item Prove that each of the topological spaces described in Exercise 1.1 \#6 is a $T_0$-space.
\end{enumerate}

	\SPECIAL{Countable-Closed Topology}

\item Let $X$ be any infinite set.  The \textbf{\textit{countable-closed topology}} is defined to be the topology having as its closed sets $X$ and all countable subsets of $X$.  Prove that this is indeed a topology on $X$.

	\item If $(X,\TT_1)$ and $(X,\TT_2)$ are $T_1$-spaces, then $(X,\TT_4)$ is a $T_1$-space.
	\item If $(X,\TT_1)$ and $(X,\TT_2)$ are $T_0$-spaces, then $(X,\TT_4)$ is not necessarily a $T_0$-space.
	\item If $\TT_1, \TT_2, \dots, \TT_n$ are topologies on a set $X$, the $\TT = \bigcap_{i=1}^n \TT_i$ is a toplogy on $X$.
	\item If for each $i \in I$, for some index set $I$, each $\TT_i$ is a topology on the set $X$, then $\TT = \bigcap_{i\in I} \TT_i$ is a topology on $X$.
\end{enumerate}

\SPECIAL{Distinct $T_1$-topologies on a Finite Set}

\item In Wikipedia \url{//enwikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_topological_space}, as we noted in Exercise 1.2 \#7, it says that the number of topologies on a finite set with $n \in \N$ points can be quite large, even for small $n$.  This is also true even for $T_0$-spaces; for $n=5$, ther are 4231 distinct $T_0$-spaces.  Prove, using mathemtaical induction, that as $n$ increases, the number of $T_0$-spaces increases.

\item A topological space $(X,T)$ is said to be a \textbf{\textit{door space}} if every subset of $X$ is either an open set or a closed set (or both).

\begin{enumerate}

\item Prove that if $a,b \in \R$ with $a < b$ then neither $[a,b)$ nor $(a,b]$ is an open subset of $\R$.  Also show that neither is a closed subset of $\R$.

In the case of $[a,b)$ there is no set $a \in (x,y)$ because $x < a$ implies that $x+\frac{|x-a|}{2}$ would have to be a member of $[a,b)$ which it cannot.  Similarly for $(a,b]$.

\item Prove that the sets $[a,\infty)$ and $(-\infty, a]$ are closed subsets of $\R$.

The composite of $[a,\infty)$ is $(-\infty, a)$ which is open and similarly for $(-\infty, a]$.

\item Show, by example, that the union of an infinite number of closed subsets of $\R$ is not necessarily a closed subset of $\R$.

Define $S_i = [1/i, 1]$ then $\mathcal{S} = \cup_{i=1}^\infty S_i$.  Obviously, given any $n \in \N$ there is a closed set $S_n=[1/n, 1]$ and there exists $(1/(n+1),1) \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ such that $1/n \in  (1/(n+1),1)$ hence $\mathcal{S}$ must be open.

\item Prove each of the following statements.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item The set $\Z$ of all integers is not an open set of $\R$.
	\item The set $\mathbb{P}$ of all prime numbers is a closed subset of $\R$ but not an open subset of $\R$.
	\item The set $\mathbb{I}$ of all irrational numbers is neither a closed subset nor an open subset of $\R$.
\end{enumerate}

\item If $F$ is a non-empty finite subset of $\R$, show that $F$ is closed in $\R$ but that $F$ is not open in $\R$.

\item if $F$ is non-empty countable subset of $\R$, prove that $F$ is not an open set, but that $F$ may or may not be a closed set depending on the choice of $F$.

\item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]

	\item Let $S=\{0,1,1/2,1/3,1/4,1/5, \dots, 1/n, \dots\}$.  Prove that the set $S$ is closed in the euclidean topology on $\R$.
	
	\item Is the set $T=\{1,1/2,1/3,1/4,1/5,\dots,1/n, \dots\}$ closed in $\R$?
	
	\item Is the set $\{\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2},3\sqrt{2},\dots, n\sqrt{2}, \dots\}$ closed in $\R$?

	\SPECIAL{$F_\sigma$-Sets and $G_\delta$-sets.}

\item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]

	\item Let $(X, \TT)$ be a topological space.  A subset $S$ of $X$ is said to be an \DEFINE{$F_\sigma$ set} if it is the union of a countable number of closed sets. Prove that all open intervals $(a,b)$ and all closed intervals $[a,b]$ are $F_\sigma$-sets in $\R$.
	
	\item Let $(X, \TT)$ be topological space.  A subset $T$ of $X$ is said to be a \DEFINE{$G_\delta$-set} if it is the intersection of a countable number of open sets.  Prove that all open intervals $(a,b)$ and all closed intervalse $[a,b]$ are $G_\delta$-sets in $\R$.

	\item Let $\ABRACKET{a,b}$ be any point in the disc $D = \{\ABRACKET{x,y} : x^2+y^2 < 1\}$.  Put $r=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.  Let $R_{\ABRACKET{a,b}}$ be the open rectangle with vertices at the points $\ABRACKET{a\pm \frac{1-r}{8}, b\pm \frac{1-r}{8}}$.  Verify that $R_{\ABRACKET{a,b}} \subset D$.
	
	\item Using (i) show that \[ D = \bigcup_{\ABRACKET{a,b}\in D} R_{\ABRACKET{a,b}}. \]
	
	\item Deduce from (ii) that $D$ is an open set in $\R^2$.
	
	\item Show that every disc $\{\ABRACKET{x,y}:(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2<c^2,a,b,c \in \R\}$ is open in $\R^2$.

\end{enumerate}

\item In this exercise you will show that the collection of all open discs in $\R^2$ is a basis for a topology on $\R^2$. [Later we shall see that this is the euclidean topology.]

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]

	\item Let $D_1$ and $D_2$ be any open discs in $\R^2$  wtih $D_1 \cap D_2 \ne \emptyset$.  If $\ABRACKET{a,b}$ is any point in $D_1 \cap D_2$, show that there exists an open disc $D_{\ABRACKET{a,b}}$ with center $\ABRACKET{a,b}$ such that $D_{\ABRACKET{A,B}} \subset D_1 \cap D_2$. [Hint: draw a picture and use a method similar to that of Exercsie 1 (i).]
	
	\item Show that \[ D_1 \cap D_2 = \bigcup_{\ABRACKET{a,b}\in D_1 \cap D_2} D_{\ABRACKET{a,b}} \]
	
	\item Using (ii) and Proposition 2.2.8, prove that the collection of all open discs in $\R^2$ is a basis for a topology on $\R^2$.

\end{enumerate}

\item Let $\BB$ be a collection of all open intervals $(a,b)$ in $\R$ with $a < b$ and $a$ and $b$ rational numbers.  Prove that $\BB$ is a basis for euclidean topology on $\R$.[Compare this with Proposition 2.2.1 and Example 2.2.3 where $a$ and $b$ wher enot necessarily rational.]

\SPECIAL{Second Axiom of Countability}

\item A topological space $(X, \TT)$ is said to satisfy the \DEFINE{second axiom of countability} or to be \DEFINE{second countable} if there exists a basis $\BB$ for $\TT$, where $\BB$ consists of only a countable number of sets.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]

	\item Using Exercise 3 above show that $\R$ satisfies the second axiom of countability.
	
	\item Prove that the discrete topology on an uncountable set does not satisfy the second axiom of countability. [Hint: It is \underline{not} enough to show that one particular basis is uncountable.  You must prove that \underline{every} basis for this topology is uncountable.]
	
	\item Prove that $\R^n$ satisfies the second axiom of countability, for each positive integer $n$.
	
	\item Let $(X, \TT)$ be the set of all integers with the finite-closed topology.  Does the space $(X, \TT)$ satisfy the second axiom of countability?
	
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\newcommand{\SSS}{\mathbb{S}}
	\item Let $m$ and $c$ be real numbers.  Then the line $L=\{\ABRACKET{x,y}: y=mx+c\}$ is a closed subset of $\R^2$
	
	\item Let $\SSS^1$ be the unit circle given by $\SSS^1 = \{\ABRACKET{x,y} \in \R^2 : X^2+y^2=1\}$.  Then $\SSS^1$ is a closed subset of $\R^2$.
	
	\item Let $\SSS^n$ be the unit $n$-sphere give by \[ \SSS^n = \{\ABRACKET{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n} \in \R^n : x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_n^2 = 1\}\].  Then $\SSS^n$ is closed subset of $\R^{n+1}$.
	
	\item Let $B^n$ be the closed unit $n$-ball give by \[ B^n = \{\ABRACKET{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n} \in \R^n : x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_n^2 \le 1\}.\]  Then $B^n$ is a closed subset of $\R^n$.
	
	\item the curve $C = \{\ABRACKET{x,y}\in\R^2 : xy=1\}$ is a closed subset of $\R^2$

\end{enumerate}

\SPECIAL{Product Topology}
\item Let $\BB_1$ be a basis for a topology $\TT_1$ on a set $X$ and $BB_2$ a basis for a topology $T_@$ on a set $Y$.  the set $X \times Y$ consists of all ordered paris $\ABRACKET{x,y}, x \in X$ and $y \in Y$.  Let $\BB$ be the collection of subsets of $X \times Y$ consisting of all the sets $B_1 \times B_2$ where $B_1 \in \BB_1$ and $B_2 \in \BB_2$.  Prove taht $\BB$ is a basis for a topology on $X \times Y$.  the topology so definedis called the \DEFINE{product topology} on $X \times Y$.
