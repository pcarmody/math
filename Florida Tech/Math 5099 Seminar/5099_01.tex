We had a talk from Dr. Hguyen regarding methods of applying statistical reasoning (or so I gathered).  The talk was quite beyond my level of expertise and include comparisons to Browinian Motion, Poisson Distribution and Markov Chains.  There was a lot of talk regarding TPP and SMP ... acronyms that I tried to comprehend but couldn't.  These were applied to economic models whos connection to these other subjects eluded me.  It went on to a very involved series of expressions using multiple indices in multiple formats (i.e, some were subscripted and some were superscripted) which lent to the complexity of the material and distracted from the effectiveness of the equations.  I'm sure that I'd need to examine his work far more thoroughly to have gotten the gist of the talk.
