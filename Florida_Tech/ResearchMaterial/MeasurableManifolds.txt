Introduction

Let 𝑅𝑛 be an Euclidean space of dimension n. Generally, manifolds are defined as an n-dimensional
topological manifold which is second countable, Hausdorff space that is locally Euclidean of dimension n
[7],[15],[10]. On such topological manifold a differential structure was also developed to study differentiable
manifolds [7], [9], [4], [15].
Let us consider some basic definitions:
Definition 1.1 Chart
Let M be a non empty set. A pair (𝑈, 𝜙), were 𝑈 is open subset of M and 𝜙 is a bijective map of 𝑈 onto open
subset of 𝑅𝑛 , is called an n-dimensional chart on M.
Definition 1.2 Atlas
By an 𝑅𝑛 – Atlas of a class 𝐶 𝑘 on M, we mean a collection 𝔸 of an n-dimensional chart (𝑈𝑖 , 𝜙𝑖 ) where 𝑖 ∈ N on
M subject to following conditions,
(i) ∞
𝑖=1 𝑈𝑖 = M, i.e. the domain of the chart in 𝔸 cover M.
(ii) For any pair of charts (𝑈𝑖 , 𝜙𝑖 ) and (𝑈𝑗 , 𝜙𝑗 ) in 𝔸, the sets 𝜙𝑖 (𝑈𝑖 ∩ 𝑈𝑗 ) and 𝜙𝑗 (𝑈𝑖 ∩ 𝑈𝑗 ) are open subsets of
𝑅𝑛 , and
(iii) maps, i.e., 𝜙𝑖 ∘ 𝜙𝑗−1 : 𝜙𝑗−1 (𝑈𝑖 ∩ 𝑈𝑗 ) → 𝜙𝑖 (𝑈𝑖 ∩ 𝑈𝑗 )
𝜙𝑗 ∘ 𝜙𝑖−1 : 𝜙𝑖 (𝑈𝑖 ∩ 𝑈𝑗 ) → 𝜙𝑗 (𝑈𝑖 ∩ 𝑈𝑗 )
are differentiable maps of class 𝐶 𝑘 (k ≥ 1). The maps 𝜙i o 𝜙𝑗−1 and 𝜙j o 𝜙𝑖 -1 for 𝑖, 𝑗 ∈ N, are called transition
maps, where the transition map 𝜙𝑖 o 𝜙𝑗−1 is inverse of 𝜙𝑗 o 𝜙𝑖 -1 are of class 𝐶 𝑘 . In an 𝑅𝑛 – Atlas of a class 𝐶 𝑘 on
M, every transition map is diffeomorphism of class 𝐶 𝑘 . An 𝑅𝑛 – Atlas is said to be of class 𝐶 ∞ if it is of class
𝐶 𝑘 for every positive integer k.
Definition 1.3 Equivalence Relation
Let 𝔸k (M) denotes the set of all 𝑅𝑛 – Atlas of a class 𝐶 𝑘 on M. Two atlases 𝔸1 and 𝔸2 in 𝔸k (M) are said to be
equivalent if 𝔸1 ∪ 𝔸2 is also in 𝔸k (M). In order that 𝔸1 ∪ 𝔸2 be a member of 𝔸k (M) for any chart (𝑈𝑖 , 𝜙𝑖 ) ∈ 𝔸1
and (𝑉𝑗 , 𝛹j) ∈ 𝔸2, the sets 𝜙𝑖 (𝑈𝑖 ∩ 𝑉𝑗 ) and 𝜓𝑗 (𝑈𝑖 ∩ 𝑉𝑗 ) be open in 𝑅𝑛 and maps 𝜙𝑖 o 𝜓𝑗−1 , 𝜓𝑗 o 𝜙𝑖−1 be of class
𝐶 𝑘 .This relation introduces an equivalence relation on 𝔸k (M) and partitions 𝔸k (M) into disjoint equivalence
classes. Each of this equivalence class is called as the differentiable structure of class 𝐶 𝑘 on M.
Definition 1.4 Differentiable n-Manifold
A set M together with a differentiable structure of class 𝐶 𝑘 is called differentiable n-manifold of class
𝑘
𝐶 . Thus a non- empty set M equipped with differentiable structure and topological structures exhibits many
interesting geometrical and topological properties.
Now, in this paper, we introduce one more structure called 𝜎- algebra which is algebraic structure on
such differentiable n-manifold M, that is locally homeomorphic to an open subset of a measurable space
𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ . The M along with 𝜎-algebra is a measurable space 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 and a measure 𝜇1 on 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 is
a measure space 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 . Our aim is to study Heine Borel property on a measure space 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 .
In this section, we introduce some basic definitions and theorems on algebraic structures on 𝑅𝑛 and define a
measure 𝜇 on 𝑅𝑛 . [8],[6],[9],[10],[11],[12],[14].

Introducing the Concept of Measure Manifold (M, Σ1, 𝓣1, 𝜇1)
Definition 1.5 𝜎-algebra on 𝑹𝒏
A 𝜎-algebra on a set 𝑅𝑛 is a collection Σ of subsets of 𝑅𝑛 such that
(i) ∅, 𝑅𝑛 ∈ Σ
(ii) If 𝑉 ∈ Σ, then 𝑉 c ∈ Σ
(iii) If 𝑉𝑗 ∈ Σ for 𝑖 ∈ N, then
∞
∞
𝑖=1 𝑉𝑖 ∈ Σ and 𝑖=1 𝑉𝑖 ∈ 𝛴
From De-Morgan‟s laws, a collection Σ of subsets of 𝑅𝑛 is called a 𝜎-algebra, if it contains empty set ∅
and is closed under the operation of taking complements, countable unions and countable intersections
Definition 1.6 Measurable Space
The space (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ) is called measurable topological space if the space 𝑅𝑛 is a non-empty space equipped with
𝜎-algebra Σ, where 𝑅𝑛 is closed with respect to countable union, intersection and complements of its subsets on
measurable space (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ).
Definition 1.7
A collection ε of an arbitrary subset of a non-empty topological place 𝑅𝑛 is said to generate 𝜎-algebra Σ(ε), if
the intersection of all of subsets of 𝑅𝑛 including ε, namely
Σ(ε) = ∩ { Σ : Σ is a subsets of 𝑅𝑛 and ε ⊆ Σ }, is the smallest 𝜎-algebra.
Note that, there is at least one 𝜎-algebra of subsets of 𝑅𝑛 , which includes ε and this is ℙ(𝑅𝑛 )
Definition 1.8 Borel 𝜎-algebra
Let 𝑅𝑛 be a topological space and 𝒯 -the collection of all open subsets of 𝑅𝑛 be a topology on 𝑅𝑛 . Then 𝜎algebra Σ generated by 𝒯 containing all open subsets of 𝑅𝑛 , is called the Borel 𝜎-algebra of 𝑅𝑛 , denoted by
𝔅𝑅 𝑛 , i.e 𝔅𝑅 𝑛 = Σ (𝒯).
The elements of 𝔅𝑅 𝑛 are Borel subsets in 𝑅𝑛 .
Proposition 1.9 [12]
Let Σ be a 𝜎-algebra of subsets of 𝑅𝑛 and 𝑉 ⊆ 𝑅𝑛 be non-empty open subset of 𝑅𝑛 and 𝐴 ∈ Σ, if we denote
𝛴 = { 𝐴 ∩ 𝑉: 𝐴 ∈ Σ}, then 𝛴 is a restricted 𝜎-algebra of subset of V.
∎
𝑉
𝑉
Definition 1.10 Restriction of Σ on V
If Σ is 𝜎-algebra of subsets of 𝑅𝑛 and 𝑉 is a non-empty open subsets of 𝑅𝑛 , 𝑉 ⊆ 𝑅𝑛 and 𝐴 ∈ Σ. Then 𝜎-algebra
restricted to 𝑉 is 𝛴 𝑉 = { 𝐴 ∩ 𝑉: 𝐴 ∈ Σ}.
Definition 1.11 Restriction of 𝓣 on V
If 𝓣-the collection of all open subsets of 𝑅𝑛 be a topology on 𝑅𝑛 and 𝑉 is a non-empty open subsets of 𝑅𝑛 ,
then restriction of 𝒯 on 𝑉 is 𝒯 𝑉={ 𝑉 ∩ G : 𝑉 ⊆ 𝑅𝑛 , G ∈ 𝒯 }
In general, if ε is any collection of subset of 𝑅𝑛 and 𝑉 ⊆ 𝑅𝑛 , we define the restriction of Σ(ε) on 𝑉 is denoted by
𝛴(𝜀)
𝛴(𝜀)
𝑉 and expressed as
𝑉 = { 𝐴 ∩ 𝑉 : 𝐴 ∈ Σ(ε) }
Definition 1.12 Measurable Subspace
The space V, 𝒯 𝑉 , 𝛴 𝑉 is called a measurable subspace, if 𝑉 is non-empty open subset of (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ)
equipped with restricted 𝜎-algebra 𝛴 𝑉.
Definition 1.13 Push forward of a 𝜎-algebra
If Σ is a 𝜎-algebra of subsets of 𝑅𝑛 and Σ ′ is a 𝜎-algebra of subsets of 𝑅𝑚 , and f: 𝑅𝑛  𝑅𝑚 is a map then the
collection {B ⊆ 𝑅𝑚 : f −1 (B) ∈ Σ} is called the push forward of Σ of 𝑅𝑛 to Σ ′ to 𝑅𝑚 by the function f.
Proposition 1.14
The collection {B ⊆ 𝑅𝑚 : f −1 (B) ∈ Σ} is a 𝜎-algebra of subsets of 𝑅𝑚 .
Proof: As f is map from measurable space 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ to measurable space (𝑅𝑚 , 𝒯 ′ , Σ ′ ) by definition of
measurable function, also inverse map f(f −1 (B)) = B ∈ 𝑅𝑚 for f −1 (B) ∈ Σ , the collection of such sets are sub
space of 𝑅𝑚 , which is also 𝜎-algebra.
∎
Proposition 1.15 If 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ and (𝑅𝑚 , 𝒯 ′ , Σ ′ ) are two topological spaces and f: 𝑅𝑛  𝑅𝑚 is continuous then
f −1 (B) is a Borel subset in 𝑅𝑛 for every Borel subset B in 𝑅𝑚 .
Proof: Let 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ and (𝑅𝑚 , 𝒯 ′ , Σ ′ ) be two topological spaces and f: 𝑅𝑛  𝑅𝑚 be continuous function. If B
is Borel subset in 𝑅𝑚 and f, f −1 are continuous, by open mapping theorem f −1 (B) is a Borel subset in 𝑅𝑛 for
every Borel subset B in 𝑅𝑚 .
∎
Definition 1.16 The pull back of a 𝜎-algebra
The Σ ′ is a 𝜎-algebra of subsets of 𝑅𝑚 and f : 𝑅𝑛  𝑅𝑚 is a map, then the collection
{f −1 (B): B ∈ Σ ′ }, is called the pull back Σ by f on 𝑅𝑛 .
We now consider the specific role of the measure called as Lebesgue measure not on any non-empty set 𝑅𝑛 but
on Real space 𝑅𝑛 .

Introducing the Concept of Measure Manifold (M, Σ1, 𝓣1, 𝜇1)
The main theme of Lebesgue measure on the general subsets of 𝑅𝑛 is to construct the notion of abstract
volume with abstract measure that reduces to the usual volume of elementary geometrical sets, such as cubes or
rectangles of 𝑅3 and 𝑅2 . If ℒ(𝑅𝑛 ) is the collection of Lebesgue measurable sets and if 𝜇 : ℒ(𝑅𝑛 )  [0, ∞] is
Lebesgue measure, then ℒ(𝑅𝑛 ) contains all n-dimensional rectangles. The required condition on, is that, 𝜇 be
countably additive [8], [11], [14]
i.e. if {𝐴𝑖 ∈ ℒ(𝑅𝑛 ): 𝑖 ∈ ℕ} is a countable collection of disjoint measurable sets, then their union should be
∞
measurable and 𝜇 ∞
=
𝑖=1 𝐴𝑖
𝑖=1 𝜇(𝐴𝑖 )
The countable additive requirement is an appropriate balanced condition between finite additive and
uncountable additivity.
Looking at the abstract nature of 𝑅𝑛 , is not possible to define Lebesgue measure of all subsets of 𝑅𝑛 in
a geometrically reasonable way. Hausdorff (1914) showed that, for any dimension n ≥ 1, there is no countable
additive measure defined on all subsets of 𝑅𝑛 that is invariant under isometries and assigns measure one to the
unit cube. Further, for n ≥ 3, there does not exists finitely additive measure. Banach and Tarski (1924) in their
paradox showed that, there are finitely additive, isometrically invariant extensions of Lebesgue measure on 𝑅𝑛
on all subsets of 𝑅𝑛 , but these extensions are not countablly additive.
It means, some subsets of abstract space 𝑅𝑛 are too irregular to have Lebesgue measure that preserves
countable additivity, in n ≥ 3 together with invariance of measure under isometries. This situation can be
handled by inducing 𝜎-algebra structure on 𝑅𝑛 and ℒ(𝑅𝑛 ) is a 𝜎-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets that
includes all possible sets also it is possible to define as isometrically invariant, countablly additive outer
measure on all subsets of 𝑅𝑛 . If 𝑅𝑛 carries the topological structure along with 𝜎 - algebra such a space 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯,
Σ, is a measureable topological space, where all subsets of 𝑅𝑛 are isometically invariant and have countablly
additive outer measure. Motivated by this approach, Lebesgue introduced some basic definitions on 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ .
Section - II, is preliminary in nature. The main results are introduced in section –III are due to S. C. P.
Halakatti. We define new concepts like measurable chart, measurable atlas and measurable manifold also
measure chart, measure atlas and measure manifold. In this section we show that if Heine-Borel property holds
on topological Euclidean space 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯 then it also holds on measure space 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇 . We extend the
study of the Heine-Borel property on a measure space 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇 and show that measure manifold
𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 also admits Heine-Borel property.

Preliminaries

We consider the measure 𝜇 that assigns a measure on each Borel subset that generates 𝜎-algebra on
𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ to introduce Measure Manifold 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 . The measure 𝜇 on measurable space 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ
([7], [8], [11], [12], [14]) is defined as follows:
Definition 2.1 Measure 𝜇 on 𝑹𝒏
A measure 𝜇 on a measurable topological space 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ is a function 𝜇: Σ  [0,∞], such that
(i) 𝜇 (∅) = 0
∞
(ii) If { 𝑉𝑛 ∈ Σ, 𝑛 ∈ ℕ} is a countable disjoint collection of subsets in Σ, then 𝜇 ∞
𝑖=1 𝑉𝑖 =
𝑖=1 𝜇(𝑉𝑖 ), ∀ 𝑉𝑖 ∈
𝑛
𝑅 , 𝒯, Σ .
Definition 2.2 Measure Space
A measure 𝜇 on a measurable space (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ) is called a measure space and denoted by (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇)
Proposition 2.3
𝜇
Let (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇) be a measure space and 𝑉 ⊂ 𝑅𝑛 , 𝐴 ∈ Σ(ε). If we define
𝑉 : Σ [0, ∞] by
𝜇
𝑉 (𝐴) = 𝜇 (𝐴 ∩ 𝑉), 𝐴 ∈ Σ(ε)
𝜇
Then 𝑉 is a measure on 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ with the following properties
𝜇
i)
𝑉(𝐴) = 𝜇 (𝐴) for every 𝐴 ∈ Σ, 𝐴 ⊆ 𝑉
𝜇
ii)
𝑉(𝐴) = 0 for every 𝐴 ∈ Σ, 𝐴 ∩ 𝑉 = ∅
𝜇
Proof:-We have 𝑉(∅) = 𝜇 (∅ ∩ 𝑉) = 𝜇 (∅) = 0.
𝜇
If 𝐴1 , 𝐴2 , …∈ 𝛴 are pairwise disjoint, 𝑉 ( ∞𝑖=1 𝐴𝑖 ) = 𝜇 (( ∞𝑖=1 𝐴𝑖 ) ∩ 𝑉) = 𝜇 ( ∞𝑖=1(𝐴𝑖 ∩ 𝑉))
𝜇
i.e., ∞𝑖=1 𝜇 (𝐴𝑖 ∩ 𝑉) = ∞𝑖=1 𝑉(𝐴𝑖 ).
𝜇
Therefore, 𝑉 is a measure on 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ and its properties are trivial to prove.
∎
Definition 2.4 Restriction of 𝜇 on V.
Let (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇) be a measure space and 𝑉 ∈ 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ be any non-empty open subset of 𝑅𝑛 , then the
𝜇
measure 𝑉 on 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ is called the restriction of 𝜇 on V.

Let (𝑅𝑛 , 𝓣, Σ, 𝜇) be a measure space and 𝑉 ∈ Σ be any non-empty open subset of 𝑅𝑛 , then the measure 𝑉 on

Definition 2.7 The push forward of a measure
Let (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇) and (𝑅𝑚 , 𝒯 ′ , Σ ′ , 𝜇 ′ ) are measure spaces and f: 𝑅𝑛  𝑅𝑚 be a map from 𝑅𝑛 to 𝑅𝑚 and let Σ ′
defined by Σ ′ = { B ⊆ 𝑅𝑚 : f −1 (B) ∈ Σ } be a 𝜎-algebra on 𝑅𝑚 , then the push forward of Σ by f on 𝑅𝑚 is
f(f −1 (B)) = B such that 𝜇 ′ (B) = 𝜇(f −1 (B)), where B ∈ Σ ′ .
If 𝜇 ′ is a measure on (𝑅𝑚 , 𝓣′ , Σ ′ , 𝜇 ′ ) it is called the push forward of 𝜇 by f on 𝑅𝑛 .
Definition 2.8 The pull back of a measure
Let (𝑅𝑛 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇) and (𝑅𝑚 , 𝒯 ′ , Σ ′ , 𝜇 ′ ) are measure spaces and let f: 𝑅𝑛  𝑅𝑚 be a one to one and onto map from
𝑅𝑛 onto 𝑅𝑚 and Σ – be a 𝜎-algebra on 𝑅𝑛 defined by Σ = { f −1 (B) : B ∈ Σ ′ }, is a pull back of Σ ′ by f on 𝑅𝑛 is
𝜇 ′ (B) = 𝜇(f −1 (B)).
If 𝜇 is a measure on (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ) it is called as the pull back of 𝝁′ by f on 𝑹𝒏 .
Definition 2.9 Outer Lebesgue measure
The outer Lebesgue measure 𝜇*(E) of a subset E ⊂ 𝑅𝑛 is 𝜇*(E) = inf { ∞𝑗 =1 𝜇(ℜ𝑗 ) ; 𝐸 ⊂ ∞
𝑗 =1 ℜ𝑗 , ℜ𝑗 ⊂
ℜ(𝑅𝑛 )}, where the infimum is taken over all countable collection of rectangles ℜ, whose union contains E. The
map 𝜇*:P(𝑅𝑛 )[0,∞], 𝜇* : E  𝜇*(E) is called outer Lebesgue measure.
Theorem 2.10
Lebesgue outer measure 𝜇* has the following properties.
(i) 𝜇* (∅) = 0
(ii) if 𝐴 ⊂ B then 𝜇*( 𝐴) ≤ 𝜇* (B)
∞
∗
(iii) if { 𝐴𝑖 ⊂ 𝑅𝑛 : 𝑖 ∈ ℕ } is a countable collection of subsets of 𝑅𝑛 ,then 𝜇 ∗ ( ∞
𝑖=1 𝐴𝑖 ) ≤ 𝑖=1 𝜇 (𝐴𝑖 )
Let us define Carathoedory measurability,
Definition 2.11
Let 𝜇* be an outer measure on a set X. A subset 𝐴 ⊂ X is Caratheodory measurable with respect to 𝜇*,
or measurable for short if 𝜇*(E) = 𝜇*(E ∩ 𝐴) + 𝜇* (E ∩ 𝐴 c), for every subset E ⊂ X.

Construction of Measure Manifold

Let M be a topological Manifold which is second countable and Hausdorff space. On Such topological
Manifold a differential structure can be induced, transforming M into differentiable Manifold of dimension n.
M carries Topological and differential structures smoothly .In this paper we induce the algebraic structure 𝜎algebra on a topological differentiable manifold that transforms M into a measurable Manifold denoted by
𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 . The 𝜎-algebraic structure on M admits a measure µ on a measurable Manifold transforming
measurable Manifold 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 into a measure Manifold denoted by 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 . In this paper S. C. P.
Halakatti introduces the concepts of measurable charts and measurable atlases hence measurable manifold on
which a measure µ1 has been introduced to study the measure of some topological characteristics on a
measurable Manifold. The first author has introduced these conceptual framework in order to study any organic
system, for example, the anatomy of a human brain, its structural and functional patterns in terms of structures
of measurable Manifold and measure the behavioral patterns of human brain in term of measure Manifold.
In this paper we introduce the basics and necessary concepts and prepare a ground for evolving a
mathematical model that represents any organic system in general and the structure of the brain in particular.
Keeping such a larger picture in the mind the present paper is developed, where only some topological
characteristics are studied on a measurable Manifold amongst many topological properties to be studied in
future. In this paper we extend the Heine-Borel property on a measure manifold 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 . The
geometrical and algebraic structures on 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 will be studied in future work.
A countable collection of measure atlases that cover the M and satisfying the equivalence relation,
induces a differentiable structure on M, converting any non-empty set M into a differentiable manifold which
represents a measure space and denoted by 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 .

An 𝑅𝑛 , measure atlas is said to be of class 𝐶 ∞ if it is of class 𝐶 𝑘 for every integer k.
Let 𝔸k(M) denotes the set of all 𝑅𝑛 measure atlases of class 𝐶 𝑘 on 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 .
Now we introduce a differential structure by defining an equivalence relation in 𝔸k(M).
Definition 3.2.7 Equivalence Relation in 𝔸𝑘 (𝑀)
Two measure atlases 𝔸1 and 𝔸2 in 𝔸𝑘 (𝑀) are said to be equivalent if (𝔸1∪𝔸2) ∈ 𝔸𝑘 (𝑀). In order that
𝒯
𝛴

introduced is an equivalence relation in 𝔸𝑘 (𝑀) and hence it partitions 𝔸𝑘 (𝑀) into disjoint equivalence classes.
Each of these equivalence classes is called a differentiable structure of class 𝐶 𝑘 on 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 . A measure
space 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 together with a differentiable structure of class 𝐶 𝑘 is called a differentiable measure nmanifold of class 𝐶 𝑘 or simply a 𝐶 𝑘 –measure n-manifold.
A non empty set M equipped with differentiable structure, topological structure and algebraic structure
𝜎- algebra is called Measurable Manifold. A measure 𝜇1 defined on 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 and the quadruple
𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 is called Measure Manifold.
Now we study a topological property on 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 .
3.3 Topological property on 𝑴, 𝓣𝟏 , 𝚺𝟏 , 𝝁𝟏
Heine-Borel property is well-defined property on Euclidean space 𝑅𝑛 . Now, we extend the study of
this property on measure space 𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇 . Further we study the extended property of Heine-Borel property
on a measure manifold (M, 𝓣1, Σ1, 𝜇1).
The present aim of this study is to quantity measure charts, measure Atlases as the union of which
gives a measurable differential structure on a measure-manifold 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 and to study the Heine-Borel
property, re-defined in-terms of measure charts and measure Atlases and examine the measure invariant
properties on 𝑀, 𝒯1 , Σ1 , 𝜇1 .
3.3.1 Heine-Borel property (HBP) on 𝑹𝒏
For a subset A of the Euclidean space 𝑅𝑛 . A has the Heine-Borel property if every open covering of A
admits a finite sub covering.
Now we extend the Heine-Borel property on measure space (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇), where elements of 𝜎-algebra
are generated by members of 𝒯 -open sets of 𝑅𝑛 . The elements of 𝜎-algebra are addressed as Borel sets.
𝜇
For a subset A ⊆ 𝑅𝑛 , let A, 𝒯 A , Σ 𝐴 , 𝐴 be a sub measure space of a measure space (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇). If
𝑛
Euclidean space 𝑅 admits Heine-Borel property then, to prove that the measure space (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇) also admits
Heine-Borel property, it is suffices to prove that every countable open measure cover has finite measure sub
cover.
Definition 3.3.2 Borel Cover
By a Borel cover viz { ∞
𝑖=1 𝑉 i : 𝑉𝑖 „s are Borel sets}, we mean accountable union of all Borel sets belonging to
(𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇).
Theorem 3.3.3
If Heine-Borel property (HBP) holds on Euclidean space 𝑅𝑛 then a measure space (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇) also admits
HBP. i.e. every Borel cover for sub-measure space of (𝑅𝑛 , 𝒯, Σ, 𝜇) has a finite Borel sub-cover.

Conclusion

Any organic system is a topological manifold having finite measure. The structural and functional
properties of a organic system, brain in particular, are determined by the intrinsic geometrical and topological
structure of the manifold. In order to study such systems, the first author has introduced measure manifolds and
extended the HBP and BWP on measure manifold. This paper is base for our future work.
