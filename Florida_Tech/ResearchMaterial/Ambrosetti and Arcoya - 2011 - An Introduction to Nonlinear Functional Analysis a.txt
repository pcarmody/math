Preface

The purpose of this book is to introduce the reader to some of the main abstract tools
of nonlinear functional analysis and their applications to semilinear elliptic Dirichlet
boundary value problems.
In the first chapter we outline some general results on Fréchet differentiability,
Nemitski operators, weak and strong solutions of the linear Laplace equation, linear compact operators and their eigenvalues and Sobolev spaces. This last topic is
discussed in greater generality in Appendix A.
Chapter 2 deals with the Banach contraction principle and with a fixed point theorem for increasing operators. In Chap. 3 we study the local inversion theorem, the
Hadamard–Caccioppoli global inversion theorem and the case in which the map to
be inverted has fold singularities. Chapter 4 is concerned with the Leray–Schauder
topological degree. Variational methods are discussed in Chap. 5. Minima, the mountain pass theorem and the linking theorem are stated and proved. Chapter 6 deals
with local and global bifurcation theory.
The abstract results collected in first part of the book are applied in the second part
to prove existence and multiplicity results for semilinear elliptic Dirichlet boundary
value problems on bounded domains in RN . We emphasize that the choice of the
appropriate abstract tool depends on the behavior of the nonlinearity f as well as on
the kind of results one expects.
First, in Chap. 7, we outline how a semilinear elliptic boundary value problem
can be transformed into an operator equation in an appropriate Banach or Hilbert
function space. In Chap. 8 we consider the case in which, roughly, f is sublinear at
infinity and one can prove a priori estimates for possible solutions. In this case one can
use degree theory or variational methods or the global inversion theorem. Chapter
9 deals with asymptotically linear problems, for which one can also use several
different approaches such as global bifurcation or variational methods. In Chap.
10 we study problems with asymmetric nonlinearities, when the behaviors at +∞
and −∞ are different. If one aims to find the precise number of multiple solutions,
the most appropriate approach turns out to be the global inversion theorem in the
presence of fold singularities. But one can also use sub- and super-solutions jointly
with degree theoretical arguments. Nonlinearities that are superlinear at infinity are
considered in Chap. 11 by means of the mountain pass or linking theorems.

Preface

In all of the preceding chapters we do not consider more general sophisticated
versions of problems, but prefer to study model cases containing the main features
of the arguments without unnecessary technical details.
The last two chapters of the book are concerned with slightly more advanced
topics of current research. In Chap. 12 a class of quasilinear elliptic problems is
discussed using critical point theory. Here the corresponding Euler functional is not
C 1 , and hence a new form of the mountain pass theorem has to be proved. Chapter
13 deals with nonlinear Schrödinger equations on R N . We prove the existence of
ground and bound states as well as semiclassical states.
The book is addressed to senior undergraduate and graduate students of mathematics as well as to students of applied sciences, who wish to utilize a modern
approach to the fascinating topic of nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations.

Chapter 1

Preliminaries

In this chapter we collect some preliminary results that we will use throughout
the rest of the book, such as Fréchet derivatives, superposition operators and weak
and classical solutions of linear elliptic equations and their eigenvalues. Sobolev
function spaces are also outlined, although a more complete treatment is postponed
until Appendix A.

1.1

Sobolev Spaces

In the classical study of boundary value problems associated to a differential equation
it is usual to add to the “local” space (in ) in which we are searching its solution,
for instance, C k (), some “global” condition. For instance, it may be required that
u ∈ C() or, in some cases, u ∈ C k (). Similarly to the construction of C k () from
the local space C k () by imposing the global condition (in ) of continuity in 
of the function and its derivatives up to the order k, the construction of the Sobolev
spaces W k,p () is a combination of local properties (weak derivatives in L1loc ())
together with a suitable “global” condition in  (the weak derivatives belong to
Lp ()).
Definition 1.1.1 If  ⊂ RN is an open subset, p ∈ [1, +∞] and k ∈ N, then the
Sobolev space W k,p () is defined as the space of the functions u ∈ Lp () such that
for every multi-index α = (α1 , α2 , . . . , αN ) with order |α| ≤ k there exists a function
vα ∈ Lp () satisfying


ϕ(x)vα (x)dx = (−1)|α| u(x)D α ϕ(x)dx, ∀ϕ ∈ C0∞ ().
Here and in the sequel, unless it is explicitly stated, the integrals are always understood to be on . The function vα is called the weak derivative of u of order α and

is denoted by D α u. W k,p () can be equipped with two equivalent norms:

|α|≤k


A particular case is the space H k () ≡ W k,2 (), ·k,2 because the norm ·k,2 is
the one associated to the inner product
(u, v)k,2 =

(D α u, D α v)L2 () .
|α|≤k

Since the product space of copies of Lp () is complete, one deduces (see Exercise 1)
that W k,p () is a Banach space for 1 ≤ p ≤ +∞, it is reflexive for 1 < p < +∞
and it is separable for 1 ≤ p < +∞. In particular, H k () is a separable Hilbert
space.
It is clear that every function in C k (), such that its partial derivatives up to
order k are also in Lp (), belongs to W k,p (). Meyers and Serrin proved that this
class of functions is a dense subspace of W k,p () provided that 1 ≤ p < +∞ (see
Theorem A.2.5).
In the study of the classical Dirichlet problem associated to the Laplace equation in
an open  ⊂ RN , the value of the solution on ∂ is prescribed. Thus, to give a weak
formulation of the Dirichlet problem, we need to define the value of u ∈ W k,p ()
on ∂. This is not trivial at all because u ∈ Lp () is the equivalence class of the
functions which are equal almost everywhere in . We first discuss the simplest case:
What is the weak space similar to the space of C k ()-functions satisfying u = 0 on
∂? To answer this question we introduce a new space.
Definition 1.1.2 If  ⊂ RN is open, 1 ≤ p ≤ +∞ and k ∈ N, we denote by
k,p
W0 () the closure of C0∞ () in the space W k,p (). In the particular case p = 2,
k,p
we also write W0 () = H0k ().
k,p

Observe that W0 () with the induced norm of W k,p () is a Banach space for

In general, the strict inclusion W0 () ⊂ W k,p () holds. Roughly, the smaller

Embedding Theorems

We state below the well-known Sobolev and Rellich–Kondrachov embedding theorems. We say that the normed space (X,  · X ) is embedded in the normed space
(Y ,  · Y ), and we denote it by X → Y , if there exists an injective linear and continuous operator I from X into Y . In this case, the operator is called an embedding.
We say that the space X is compactly embedded in the space Y , if there exists an
embedding of X in Y which is compact. An operator T : X → X is said to be compact if it is continuous and T (A) is relatively compact for all bounded sets A ⊂ X
(see Definition 1.3.1 below). We state in a unique theorem a unified version of the
Sobolev and Rellich–Kondrachov theorems (see Theorems A.4.3 and A.4.9 for more
general results).

Linear Elliptic Equations

Many applications lead to the study of minimization problems like

min H (x, v, ∇v) dx
where  is an open subset of RN and H is a function in  × RN +1 .
It is more convenient to solve this problem in the weak formulation than in the
classical one. In order to do this in a more clear way, we consider the Dirichlet
principle, i.e., the problem which consists in looking for the function u such that
∇u has minimal L2 -norm in the manifold of all functions with prescribed value u0
on ∂:



(1.2)
min
|∇v| dx : v = u0 on ∂ .
Now, thinking that the simpler similar minimization problem


min |v|2 : v ∈ Q, v2 ≥ 2
has no solution
 because Q is not complete or equivalently because the set
v ∈ Q : v2 ≥ 2 is not closed in the Banach space R, we understand that
it is a good idea to set out minimization in the completion (with respect to the
L2 ()-norm of the gradient) of the functions with value u0 on ∂. This means that
we study the Dirichlet principle as
min J (v)
v∈A

with the functional J : X = H () −→ R given by J (v) =
A = {v ∈ H 1 () : v − u0 ∈ H01 ()}, for some u0 ∈ H 1 ().

Fréchet Differentiability

Let X, Y be Banach spaces, u ∈ X and consider a map F : X  → Y . In the particular
case that Y = R, F is called a functional. We say that F is differentiable at u ∈ X
along the direction v ∈ X if there exists
F (u + tv) − F (u)
.

Lu [v] := lim

Elementary examples on X = R2 show that F can be differentiable along every
direction without being continuous.

1.2 Linear Elliptic Equations

We say that F is (Fréchet) differentiable at u ∈ X if there exists a linear continuous
map Lu : X −→ Y such that
F (u + v) − F (u) = Lu [v] + o(v),

as v → 0.

The map Lu is uniquely determined by F and u and will be denoted by dF (u) or else
F  (u). It is easy to see that if F is Fréchet differentiable, then it is also differentiable
along any direction. Conversely, if F is differentiable along any directions, Lu ∈
L(X, Y ) and the map u  → Lu is continuous from X to L(X, Y ), then F is Fréchet
differentiable.
The Fréchet derivative has the same properties as the usual differential in
Euclidean spaces. For example, if X, Y , Z are Banach spaces, F : X  → Y ,
G : Y  → Z and F is differentiable at u ∈ X, resp. G is differentiable at F (u) ∈ Y ,
then the composite map G ◦ F is differentiable at u and the following chain rule
holds:
D(G ◦ F )(u)[v] = dG(F (u))[dF (u)[v]].
One can also define higher derivatives, partial derivatives and so on. In particular, the
second derivative will be denoted by d 2 F (u). For more details, the reader is referred,
e.g., to Chaps. 1 and 2 of [17].

1.2.2

Nemitski Operators

Let f :  × R −→ R. The Nemitski operator associated to f (x, u) is the
superposition operator
f : u(x)  → f (x, u(x))
defined on the class of measurable functions u :  −→ R. If there is no possible
misunderstanding, we will use the same symbol f to denote the Nemitski operator
associated to f (x, u). Here and below  denotes a bounded domain in RN .
Suppose that f (x, u) is Carathéodory, namely:
1. f (x, .) is continuous in R for a.e. x ∈ ,
2. f (., u) is measurable in  for all u ∈ R.
Let us point out that if f (x, u) is Carathéodory then the Nemitski operator f maps any
measurable function u(x) to a measurable function f (u). The continuity and Fréchet
differentiability of Nemitski operators are collected in the following theorems. We
omit the proof, referring the reader to Sect. 1.2 of [17].
Theorem 1.2.1 Suppose that f (x, u) is Carathéodory and that there exist a, b ∈ R
such that
|f (x, u)| ≤ a + b|u|p/q , p, q ≥ 1.
Then the Nemitski operator f is continuous from Lp () to Lq ().

1 Preliminaries

Theorem 1.2.2 Suppose that f (x, u) is Carathéodory and that f (x, .) is differentiable with respect to u with derivative fu (x, u) which is Carathéodory. Moreover,
let p > 2 and suppose that there exist c, d ∈ R such that
|fu (x, u)| ≤ c + d|u|p−2 .
Then the Nemitski operator f is differentiable on Lp () with differential df (u) :


v  → fu (u)v.
Remark 1.2.3 (i) It is possible to prove that if the Nemitski operator f maps Lp ()
into Lq () then f ∈ C(Lp (), Lq ()).
(ii) Let f (x, u) and fu (x, u) be Carathéodory functions and |fu (x, u)| ≤ const.
Then one can show that f : L2 () −→ L2 () is differentiable along every direction.
On the other hand, if f is Fréchet differentiable at some u∗ ∈ L2 () then there exist
measurable functions a(x), b(x) such that f (x, u) = a(x) + b(x)u.

1.2.3

Dirichlet Principle

Problem (1.2) is solved by using the Weierstrass theorem.
Theorem 1.2.4 Let J : A → R ∪ {+∞} be a lower semicontinuous functional
defined on a compact topological space A. Then J is bounded from below and it
attains its minimum.
Proof We only give here the proof for the case in which J is sequentially lower
semicontinuous1 and A is sequentially compact. Define
⎧
⎨inf{J (v) : v ∈ A}, if this infimum exists
α=
⎩
−∞,
if the above infimum does not exist.
In any case, we can choose a sequence {vn } in A such that
lim J (vn ) = α.

n→+∞

Since A is sequentially compact, there exists a converging subsequence, still denoted
{vn }, to some point v ∈ A. Thus the sequentially lower semicontinuity of J implies
that
J (v) ≤ lim inf J (vn ) = lim J (vn ) = α.
n→+∞

n→+∞

By the definition of α we get
J (v) = α,
which, in particular, means that α is finite, i.e., J is bounded from below. In addition,
the infimum α of J is attained at v.


Let us remark that every sequentially lower semicontinuous functional J is also lower semicontinuous and that, in addition, the converse holds provided that A satisfies the first axiom of countability.
See [48] for the proofs of these facts and also for a complete proof of the theorem of Weierstrass.

If the dimension of X is infinite, the hypothesis on the compactness of A is
very restrictive provided that we consider the topology induced by the norm. To
overcome this difficulty we assume that X is reflexive and J is coercive, i.e.
limu∈A, u→+∞ J (u) = +∞. Indeed, the coerciveness allows us to reduce the minimization in A to A ∩ B(0, R) for some R > 0 large enough. Since the closed ball
B(0, R) in a reflexive space is weakly compact, it is easy to deduce the following
result.
Corollary 1.2.5 If X is a reflexive Banach space, A is a weakly closed subset in X
and J : A −→ R is a w.l.s.c.2 coercive functional in A, then there exists u ∈ A such
that
J (u) = min{J (v) : v ∈ A}.




Now, we are ready to prove the Dirichlet principle.
Corollary 1.2.6 (Dirichlet principle) Let  be an open bounded set in RN . For every
fixed u0 ∈ H 1 (), there exists a unique function u ∈ H 1 () satisfying that u − u0 ∈
H01 () and
(i) If A = {v ∈ H 1 () : v − u0 ∈ H01 ()}, then


|∇u|2 = min |∇v|2
v∈A

(ii) u satisfies


∇u · ∇v = 0,

∀v ∈ H01 (),

u = u0 on ∂.
Remark 1.2.7 A function u ∈ H 1 () satisfying (ii) of the above corollary is called
a weak solution for the boundary value problem (in the sequel, b.v.p.)
−u = 0, x ∈ 
u = u0 , x ∈ ∂.
In general, we have the following definition.
Definition 1.2.8 Given h ∈ L2 (), we say that u ∈ H 1 () is a weak solution of the
problem
−u = h, x ∈ 
u = u0 , x ∈ ∂
if it satisfies




∇u · ∇v =

and u = u0 on ∂.

Although the notion of semicontinuity had been previously used in other fields, e.g., the Lebesgue
integral, it was L. Tonelli who introduced this notion for the first time in the calculus of variations.

8

1 Preliminaries

If N ≥ 3, by the Sobolev embedding (see Theorem 1.1.3), every function h ∈
L2N/(N+2) () belongs to the dual space H −1 () of H01 (). Then one can substitute
the space L2 () by L2N/(N+2) () in the previous definition.
Proof of Corollary 1.2.6 Consider X := H 1 () and define the Dirichlet functional
J : X −→ R by taking

J (v) = |∇v|2 , v ∈ X.
We begin by observing that J is coercive in the weakly3 closed set A. Indeed, from
the Poincaré inequality (see Proposition A.3.12), for any v ∈ A we have




v2 = [(v − u0 ) + u0 ]2 ≤ 2 (v − u0 )2 + 2 u02


≤ 2C1 |∇(v − u0 )|2 + 2 u02



≤ 4C1 |∇v|2 + 4C1 |∇u0 |2 + 2 u02 ,
i.e.




|∇v|2 ≥ C2

v 2 − C3 ,

where C1 , C2 , . . . denote different positive constants. From the above inequality one
can easily deduce the coerciveness of J in A.
The proof of the semicontinuity of J is based on the convexity of the square
function |ξ |2 , ξ ∈ RN . Indeed, this means that
|ξ |2 ≥ |ξ0 |2 + 2ξ0 · (ξ − ξ0 ), ∀ξ , ξ0 ∈ RN .
Taking ξ = ∇w and ξ0 = ∇u, with v, w ∈ H 1 (), it follows that

J (w) ≥ J (v) + 2 ∇v · (∇w − ∇v) ,

(1.3)

for every v, w ∈ H 1 () and thus J is convex. In particular, if w = vn is weakly
convergent to v in H 1 (), we have

lim
∇v · (∇vn − ∇v) = 0
n→+∞

and therefore
lim inf J (vn ) ≥ J (v).
n→+∞

The uniqueness is due to the strict convexity4 of J (which is also due to the strict
convexity of |ξ |2 ).
3

Note that A is clearly convex, thus it is sufficient to observe that A is closed in the topology of the
norm.
4
That is, the strict inequality in (1.3) is satisfied for every v = w ∈ H 1 ().

To prove (ii), it suffices to note that, for every fixed v ∈ H01 (), the function

Regularity of the Solutions

The regularity of weak solutions of (1.4) are stated in the following theorem.
Theorem 1.2.11 1. If ∂ is of class C 1,1 and h ∈ Lp () for some p ∈ [2, +∞)
then the unique weak solution u ∈ H01 () of (1.4) belongs to W 2,p () and
uW 2,p ≤ C hLp ,
for some C > 0. In particular, if h ∈ C() then u ∈ C 1 ().
2. If ∂ is of class C 2,ν , 0 < ν < 1, and h ∈ C 0,ν (), then u ∈ C 2,ν () is a classical
solution of (1.4) and

for some C > 0.

The former inequalities are known as Agmon–Douglis–Nirenberg estimates or
Lp -theory. The latter ones are the Schauder estimates.

1.2.5

The Inverse of the Laplace Operator

For an open bounded set  in RN , we can define a linear operator K : L2 () −→
H01 () by setting K(h) = u, the solution of (1.4). By the compact embedding
Theorem 1.1.3, K is compact as a map from L2 () into itself. In addition, the
restriction of K to H01 () into itself is also compact (see Exercise 5).
Similarly, we can use the Schauder estimate given in Theorem 1.2.11 to consider,
for instance, K as a map from C 0,ν () into itself. The Ascoli compactness theorem
implies that K is also compact (see Exercise 6). Moreover, using the last statement
in Theorem 1.2.11-1, it can be verified that K is compact as a map from C() into
itself.

Let  ⊂ RN be an open and bounded subset, r ∈ N2 , ∞ ∩ (1, ∞) and m ∈ Lr ()
a function (weight). We consider the weighted eigenvalue problem
−u = λm(x)u,
u = 0,

x∈
x ∈ ∂.

(1.6)

That is, we look for pairs (λ, u) ∈ R × (H01 () \ {0}) such that (1.6) holds in the
weak sense, i.e.,


∇u · ∇v dx = λ muv dx, ∀v ∈ H01 ().
(1.7)

1.3 Linear Elliptic Eigenvalue Problems

11

In this case, we say that λ is an eigenvalue and u an associated eigenfunction.

if N ≥ 3
⎨L

⎨L
mu ∈

L () (∀t ∈ (1, r))

if N ≥ 3
if N ≤ 2,

and thus the right-hand side of (1.7) is well defined.
Clearly, λ = 0 is not an eigenvalue of (1.6). Hence, we devote our attention to look
for nonzero eigenvalues of this problem. In order to do so, we consider H ≡ H01 ()
and for a fixed number t0 in (1, r) we pick

w = 0,

Note that, in this way, the operator K : Lp () → H is linear and continuous. We
define also the operator T : H → H by T u = K(mu) for every u ∈ H , i.e., T u is
the unique point in H satisfying


∇T u · ∇v = muv, ∀v ∈ H.

It is easy to verify that T is linear and symmetric (i.e., (T u, v) = (u, T v), for every
u, v ∈ H ).

1.3.1

Linear Compact Operators

In this subsection we give a short survey on linear compact operators, which will
play a fundamental role in dealing with elliptic boundary value problems. For more
details and proofs we refer to [36]. The following definition has already been given
Section 1.1.1.
Definition 1.3.1 If X and Y are Banach spaces, an operator T : X −→ Y is compact
if it is continuous and T (A) is relatively compact for all bounded sets A ⊂ X.

12

1 Preliminaries

Let us remark that the composition of a continuous operator with a compact operator
is also a compact operator (see Exercise 4). For example, the operator T given by
(1.8) is compact. Indeed, if {un } ⊂ H is weakly converging to a u ∈ H , by using the
compact embedding of H into Lt () for t ∈ [1, 2∗ ), we deduce that this sequence is
strongly converging in Lt () and, hence, applying the Hölder inequality, we obtain
{mun } −→ muinLp ()
from which, the continuity of K implies that {T un } is strongly converging in H to T u
and T is compact. For compact operators, the Fredholm alternative applies yielding
the following.
Theorem 1.3.2 Let X be a Banach space and let T : X −→ X be linear and
compact. Then:
1. Ker [I − T ] is finite dimensional;
2. Range [I − T ] is closed, has finite codimension and Range [I − T ] = Ker [I −
T ∗ ]⊥ , where T ∗ denotes the adjoint of T ;
3. Ker [I − T ] = {0} ⇔ Range [I − T ] = X.


Remark 1.3.3 A linear operator L : X → X is called a Fredholm operator if
dim Ker L < ∞ and Range L is closed and has finite codimension. In this case,
the index of L is dim Ker L − codim Range L. In particular, the preceding theorem
states that I − T is a Fredholm operator of zero index.
Let T be compact and set Aγ (u) = T (u) − γ u.
Definition 1.3.4 The resolvent of T is the set
ρ(T ) = {γ ∈ R : Aγ is bijective from X to itself}
The spectrum σ (T ) of T is defined as σ (T ) = R \ ρ(T ). A γ ∈ R such that
Ker [Aγ ] = {0} is called an eigenvalue of T and Ker [Aγ ] is called eigenspace
associated to the eigenvalue γ . We also say that μ ∈ R is a characteristic value of T
if the kernel of the operator u  → μT (u) − u is different from {0}.
Remark 1.3.5 If γ ∈ σ (T ) then the closed graph theorem implies that Aγ is invertible
and has a continuous inverse [36, Corollary 2.7].
Concerning the spectrum of T , the Riesz–Fredholm theory provides the following
result.
Theorem 1.3.6 Let T be linear and compact. Then σ (T ) is compact and σ (T ) ⊂
[ − T , T ]. Furthermore, if X is infinite dimensional, one has:
1. 0 ∈ σ (T );
2. Every γ ∈ σ (T ) \ {0} is an eigenvalue of T ;
3. Either σ (T ) = {0}, or σ (T ) is finite, or σ (T ) \ {0} is a sequence which tends to 0.
Moreover, for every γ ∈ σ (T ) \ {0}, there exists m ≥ 1 such that
Ker [Akγ ] = Ker [Ak+1
γ ],

∀ k ≥ m,

integer m such that (1.9) holds. When m = 1 we say that the eigenvalue is simple.

1.3.2 Variational Characterization of The Eigenvalues
Let T be defined by (1.8). Then λ ∈ R \ {0} is an eigenvalue of (1.6) if and only if
λ is a characteristic value of T . Applying Theorem 1.3.6, we deduce the following

(i) 0 is not an eigenvalue of (1.6).
(ii) (a) If the Lebesgue measure |+ | of + is zero, then (1.6) has no positive

(b) If |+ | > 0, then the positive eigenvalues of (1.6) define a nondecreasing

Some Fixed Point Theorems

In this chapter we discuss the classical Banach contraction principle and a fixed
point theorem for increasing operators that will be used in connection to sub- and
super-solutions of elliptic boundary value problems.

2.1 The Banach Contraction Principle
Let X be a complete metric space. An operator T : X → X is a contraction if there
exists α ∈ (0, 1) such that
dX (T (u), T (v)) ≤ α dX (u, v),

∀ u, v ∈ X,

(2.1)

where dX (u, v) denotes the distance from u to v in X.
Remark 2.1.1 From (2.1) it immediately follows that T is continuous.
Theorem 2.1.2 If X is a complete metric space and T is a contraction on X which
maps X into itself, then there exists a unique z ∈ X such that T (z) = z.
Proof Existence. For any fixed u0 ∈ X let us define the sequence uk by setting
uk+1 = T (uk ),

k ∈ N.

One has that for every j ≥ 1
dX (uj +1 , uj ) = dX (T (uj ), T (uj −1 )) ≤ αdX (uj , uj −1 )
and this, by induction, implies
dX (uj +1 , uj ) ≤ α j dX (u1 , u0 ).
Then, it follows that

2 Some Fixed Point Theorems

Since 0 < α < 1, uk is a Cauchy sequence. Let z ∈ X be such that uk → z. Passing
to the limit into uk+1 = T (uk ) and using the fact that T is continuous, it follows that
z = T (z).
Uniqueness. Let z1 , z2 ∈ X be fixed points of T . From this and (2.1) we infer
dX (z1 , z2 ) = dX (T (z1 ), T (z2 )) ≤ αdX (z1 , z2 ).
Since α < 1, it follows that z1 = z2 .




As a typical application of the Banach contraction principle we can prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the Cauchy problem for a first order differential
equation. This will be achieved by transforming the differential problem into an
equivalent integral equation.
Let (x0 , y0 ) be a point in a domain  ⊂ R2 . For a continuous function f :  −→
R, we consider the Cauchy problem

y  = f (x, y)
(2.2)
y(x0 ) = y0 .
By a (local) solution of (2.2) we mean a C 1 function y(x) defined in some interval
(a, b) ⊂ R such that (x, y(x)) ∈  and y  (x) = f (x, y(x)) for every x ∈ (a, b) which
passes by the point (x0 , y0 ), i.e. y(x0 ) = y0 .
Lemma 2.1.3 The Cauchy problem (2.2) is equivalent to the integral equation
 x
f (t, y(t))dt.
(2.3)
y(x) = y0 +
x0

Proof If y(x) satisfies (2.3) then, clearly, y(x0 ) = y0 . Moreover, differentiating one
finds
y  (x) = f (x, y(x)).
Hence y(x) is a solution of (2.2). Conversely, let y(x) be a solution of (2.2).
Integrating from x0 to x the identity y  (x) ≡ f (x, y(x)) we get
 x
 x
y  (t)dt =
f (t, y(t))dt.
x0

x0

Using the initial condition y(x0 ) = y0 we deduce (2.3).




Definition 2.1.4 We say that f (x, y) is locally Lipschitzian with respect to y at
(x0 , y0 ) if there exist a neighborhood U of (x0 , y0 ) and L > 0 such that
|f (x, y) − f (x, y1 )| ≤ L |y − y1 |,

∀ (x, y), (x, y1 ) ∈ U.

(2.4)

If the preceding relationship is valid in all the domain  of f we say that f is
(globally) Lipschitzian on  with respect to y.

2.1 The Banach Contraction Principle

19

Obviously, any function f which is C 1 with respect to y in  is locally Lipschitzian
on  with respect to y. On the other hand, any Lipschitzian function with respect
to y is continuous
in the variable y. But the converse is not true. For example,
√
f (x, y) = |y| is not Lipschitzian at (0, 0).
Theorem 2.1.5 Suppose that f (x, y) is continuous and locally Lipschitzian with
respect to y at (x0 , y0 ). Then the Cauchy problem (2.2) has a unique solution y(x)
defined in a neighborhood of x0 .
Proof Let I = [x0 − δ, x0 + δ] with



where a, L > 0 are chosen in such a way that (2.4) holds in U = [x0 − a, x0 + a] ×
[y0 − a, y0 + a] and M = sup(x,y)∈U |f (x, y)|. We will use the Banach contraction
principle to show that the equivalent integral Eq. (2.3) has a unique solution in I .
Let also denote by X the Banach space C(I ) endowed with the sup norm
||y|| = sup |y(x)|
x∈I

and consider the ball B in X of radius a centered at y0 , that is,
B = {y ∈ X : ||y − y0 || ≤ a}.
Define the operator T : X  → X by setting
 x
f (t, y(t))dt.
T [y](x) = y0 +

(2.5)

x0

First of all, let us show that T (B) ⊂ B. Actually,
|T [y](x) − y0 | ≤ M δ < a.
Taking the supremum in I , we find ||T [y] − y0 || < a and hence T [y] ∈ B. Next,
we show that T is a contraction on B. Actually, using the fact that f is locally
Lipschitzian we get
 x
|f (t, y(t)) − f (t, y1 (t))|dt
|T [y](x) − T [y1 ](x)| ≤
x0

≤

 x

L |y(t) − y1 (t))|dt ≤ δL ||y − y1 ||.

x0

Taking again the supremum in I ,
||T [y] − T [y1 ]|| ≤ δL ||y − y1 ||.
Since δL < 1, T is a contraction. Using the Banach contraction principle, we infer
that T has a unique fixed point y ∗ on B. From T [y ∗ ] = y ∗ we deduce
 x
∗
∗
f (t, y ∗ (t))dt.
y (x) = T [y ](x) = y0 +

Therefore y is the (unique) solution of (2.3) we were looking for.

2 Some Fixed Point Theorems

Remark 2.1.6 Observe that the existence result proved above is local. Indeed, the
interval of existence I = [x0 − δ, x0 + δ] depends on L, M, and on the initial
condition. The following example shows that the local result is the only one we can
hope for. Consider the Cauchy problem

y = y2,
y(0) = p > 0.
One checks that
y(x) =

p
1 − px

satisfies the Cauchy problem. The maximal interval of definition of this solution is
(0, p−1 ) and depends on the initial condition. Let us point out that f (y) = y 2 is not
globally Lipschitzian.
Remark 2.1.7 If  is a strip  = {(x, y) : a < x < b, y ∈ R} and f is globally
Lipschitzian on this strip, then (2.2) has a unique solution defined on all (a, b) (a can
be −∞ and/or b can be +∞).
Remark 2.1.8 If f is not Lipschitzian, but is merely continuous, it is possible to prove
that (2.2) has a solution, defined locally near x0 (Peano’s theorem, see Exercise 18),
though the uniqueness can fail. For example, the problem

√
y  = |y|,
y(0) = 0,
has infinitely many solutions: one is y ≡ 0; in addition for any a > 0 any function

0,
for |x| < a,
y(x) = 1
(x

|x| ≥ a,

is also a solution.
In the next chapter, as a second application of the Banach contraction principle,
we will prove the local inversion theorem (see Theorem 3.1.1).

2.2

Increasing Operators

In this section we will discuss another iteration scheme on ordered Banach spaces.
Let X be a Banach space endowed with an ordering ≤ such that (linear ordering)
v ≤ w ⇒ αv + z ≤ αw + z,

∀ v, w, z ∈ X,

∀α ≥ 0.

We write w ≥ v if and only if v ≤ w. We will also suppose that the norm in X is
related to the ordering by the fact that there exists C > 0 such that
0 ≤ v ≤ w ⇒ v ≤ Cw.

(2.6)

2.2 Increasing Operators

21

We say that an operator T : X → X is increasing if
v ≤ w ⇒ T (v) ≤ T (w),

∀ v, w ∈ X.

If v ∈ X satisfies v ≤ T (v), it is called a sub-solution of the fixed point equation of
T , T (u) = u. Similarly, w ∈ X is a super-solution if T (w) ≤ w.
Given a sub-solution v ∈ X, we define an iteration scheme by setting

u0 = v
(2.7)
uk+1 = T (uk ), k = 1, 2, . . .
Lemma 2.2.1 Let T : X → X be an increasing operator and suppose that there
exist a sub-solution v ∈ X and a super-solution w ∈ X of the fixed point equation of
T such that v ≤ w. Then the sequence uk given by (2.7) satisfies v ≤ uk ≤ uk+1 ≤ w,
for all k = 0, 1, . . . .
Proof We argue by induction. By the definition of sub-solution, for k = 0 one has
u1 = T (u0 ) = T (v) ≥ v. Moreover, from uk ≥ uk−1 and the fact that T is increasing
we infer that T (uk ) ≥ T (uk−1 ) and hence
uk+1 = T (uk ) ≥ T (uk−1 ) = uk .
Similarly, one has that u0 = v ≤ w and, if uk ≤ w, the fact that T is increasing and
the definition of super-solution yield uk+1 = T (uk ) ≤ T (w) ≤ w.


Theorem 2.2.2 Let T ∈ C(X, X) be compact and increasing and assume that there
exist a sub-solution v ∈ X and a super-solution w ∈ X of the fixed point equation of
T satisfying v ≤ w. Then the sequence uk given by (2.7) converges to some u ∈ X
such that T (u) = u. Moreover, v ≤ u ≤ w.
Proof Since, by Lemma 2.2.1, 0 ≤ uk − v ≤ w − v, the property (2.6) implies that
uk  ≤ uk − v + v ≤ Cw − v + v ≤ C1 .
Since T is a compact operator, the sequence T (uk ) is relatively compact and, up
to a subsequence, it converges to some u ∈ X (actually by the monotonicity property
of uk , the whole sequence converges). From uk+1 = T (uk ) and the continuity of
T , we infer that u = T (u). Moreover, again using Lemma 2.2.1, it follows that
v ≤ u ≤ w.


Remark 2.2.3 By the definition of uk , u = limk→∞ uk is the minimal fixed point of
T in {z ∈ X : v ≤ z ≤ w}.
Later on, Theorem 2.2.2 will be applied to the study of the existence of solutions
of nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems via sub- and super-solutions (see
Sect. 7.2).

Local and Global Inversion Theorems

This chapter deals with the local inversion theorem and the implicit function theorem
in Banach spaces. The Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction is discussed in Sect. 3.3. In
Sect. 3.4 we prove the global inversion theorem, which goes back to Hadamard and
Caccioppoli. Section 3.5 deals with a global inversion theorem in the presence of
fold singularities.

3.1 The Local Inversion Theorem
Let X, Y be Banach spaces and let F : X → Y . In the study of the existence of pairs
(u, h) satisfying the equation F (u) = h, it may occur that a “trivial” solution (u0 , h0 )
(i.e., F (u0 ) = h0 ) is known. The local inversion theorem is a classical result that
allows us to solve an equation F (u) = h in a neighborhood of (u0 , h0 ).
Theorem 3.1.1 Let u0 ∈ X and h0 ∈ Y be such that F (u0 ) = h0 and suppose that
there exists a neighborhood U0 ⊂ X of u0 such that
(i) F ∈ C 1 (U0 , Y );
(ii) dF (u0 ) is invertible (as a linear map from X to Y ).
Then there exists a neighborhood U ⊂ U0 of u0 and a neighborhood V ⊂ Y of
h0 such that the equation F (u) = h has a unique solution in U , for all h ∈ V .
Furthermore, denoting by F −1 : V → U the inverse of F |U , one has that F −1 is of
class C 1 and there holds for every u ∈ U
dF −1 (h) = [dF (u)]−1 ,

where F (u) = h.

Proof Up to translations, we can assume that u0 = 0 and h0 = 0. In order to
apply the Banach contraction principle (see Theorem 2.1.2), we let L = dF (0) and
 : U0 → U0 defined by setting
consider the map F

that is, u is a fixed point of Fh (u) := F
closed ball Br = {u ∈ X : u ≤ r} is contained in U0 . Since F is C 1 in U0 , then
dF (w) → dF (0) = L as w → 0. Therefore, given α ∈ (0, 1), there exists δ ∈ (0, r)
such that
sup I − L−1 ◦ dF (w) ≤ α,
w≤δ

(I denotes the identity map in X). From the mean value theorem we infer

∀ u ∈ Bδ .

Choosing ε > 0 such that L−1 h < (1 − α)δ provided h < ε, we obtain
Fh (u) ≤ δ,

∀ u ∈ Bδ ,

∀ h < ε.

In conclusion, if h < ε, then Fh maps Bδ into itself and is a contraction in Bδ . By
the Banach contraction principle, it follows that Fh has a unique fixed point zh ∈ Bδ
such that F (zh ) = h.
To show that F −1 is continuous, we set u = F −1 (h), v = F −1 (k), namely


F (u) + L−1 h = u and F

This implies that
u − v ≤

L−1 
h − k
1−α

(3.2)

and proves that F −1 is continuous (in fact, Lipschitzian). To complete the proof, we
have to show that
F −1 (k) − F −1 (h) − [dF (u)]−1 [k − h] = o(k − h).

(3.3)

From the differentiability of F we infer F (v) − F (u) − dF (u)[v − u] = o(v − u),
namely k − h = dF (u)[v − u] + o(v − u). This implies that [dF (u)]−1 [k − h] =
v − u + o(v − u). Substituting into (3.3) and taking into account that v = F −1 (k)
and u = F −1 (h), we get
F −1 (k) − F −1 (h) − [dF (u)]−1 [k − h] = o(v − u).
Finally we use (3.2) to infer that o(v − u) = o(k − h), and this completes the
proof.

3.2 The Implicit Function Theorem

25

Remark 3.1.2 If F is of class C k , k ≥ 1, it is possible to show that F −1 is also of
class C k .
Remark 3.1.3 If F is not C 1 but merely differentiable at u, then the assertion of
Theorem 3.1.1 is not satisfied. Indeed, elementary examples with X = Y = R show
that F can fail to be locally injective (see Exercise 14). In addition if X = Y has
infinite dimension, one can exhibit cases in which F is neither locally injective nor
surjective (see Exercise 15).

3.2 The Implicit Function Theorem
The implicit function theorem deals with the solvability of an equation as F (λ, u) = 0,
where λ is a parameter. To simplify the notation, we will suppose that λ ∈ R, although
the more general case in which λ ∈ Rn is quite similar.
Theorem 3.2.1 Let X, Y be Banach spaces and fix (λ0 , u0 ) ∈ R × X. Assume that F
is a C 1 map from a neighborhood of (λ0 , u0 ) in R × X into Y such that F (λ0 , u0 ) = 0
and suppose that du F (λ0 , u0 ) is invertible. Then there exist a neighborhood  of
λ0 and a neighborhood U of u0 , such that the equation F (λ, u) = 0 has a unique
solution u = u(λ) ∈ U for all λ ∈ . The function u(λ) is of class C 1 , and the
following holds:
u (λ0 ) = −[du F (λ0 , u0 )]−1 dλ F (λ0 , u0 ).

(3.4)

Proof Let 0 ⊂ R denote a neighborhood of λ0 and U0 ⊂ X a neighborhood of u0
such that F ∈ C 1 (0 ×U0 , Y ). Let us consider the auxiliary function S : 0 ×U0 →
0 × Y defined by setting
S(λ, u) = (λ, F (λ, u)).
We want to apply the local inversion theorem (Theorem 3.1.1) to S at (λ0 , u0 ). The
derivative dS(λ0 , u0 ) is the map
(α, v)  → (α, dλ F (λ0 , u0 )α + du F (λ0 , u0 )[v]).
Let us consider the equation dS(λ0 , u0 )[α, v] = (β, h). It is immediate to check that
this equation has a unique solution given by
α = β,

v = [du F (λ0 , u0 )]−1 (h − dλ F (λ0 , u0 )β) ,

and this implies that dS(λ0 , u0 ) is invertible. A straight application of the local inversion theorem to S(λ, u) = (λ, 0) yields a C 1 map R, defined in a neighborhood
 × U of (λ0 , 0), such that S ◦ R(λ, h) = (λ, h) for all (λ0 , h) ∈  × U . This means
that the components (R1 (λ, h), R2 (λ, h)) of R satisfy
R1 (λ, h) = λ,

F (λ, R2 (λ, h)) = h,

and hence u(λ) := R2 (λ, 0) is the function we are looking for. In order to find u (λ), it
suffices to remark that F (λ, u(λ)) = 0 for all λ ∈ . Taking the derivative at (λ0 , u0 )

26

we get

3 Local and Global Inversion Theorems

dλ F (λ0 , u0 ) + [du F (λ0 , u0 )]u (λ0 ) = 0,



and hence (3.4) holds. This completes the proof.

3.3 The Lyapunov–Schmidt Reduction
In the sequel we will frequently deal with an equation like
Lu + H (u) = λu,

u ∈ E,

(3.5)

where for simplicity E is a Hilbert space, L : E → E is linear continuous and
H ∈ C 1 (E, E) is such that H (0) = 0, H  (0) = 0. Setting F (λ, u) = Lu+H (u)−λu,
one has that F (λ, 0) ≡ 0 for all λ ∈ R. In order to apply the implicit function theorem,
we calculate
du F (λ, 0)[v] = Lv + H  (0)[v] − λv = Lv − λv.
Therefore, the implicit function theorem applies provided λ ∈ σ (L), where σ (L)
denotes the spectrum of L (see Definition 1.3.4). In this case, the trivial solution
u = 0 is the unique solution of (3.5) in a neighborhood of zero. Otherwise, we are in
the presence of a singularity and we can use a procedure that goes back to Lyapunov
and Schmidt (see [66, 67, 81]). Roughly, one splits the equation Lu + H (u) = λu in
a system of two equations, into which one equation can be uniquely solved, while
the other one inherits the effects of the singularity.
Let us suppose that λ∗ is an eigenvalue of L and let Z = Ker (L − λI ), where I
denotes the identity map in E. Z is closed and there exists a closed subset W ⊂ E
such that E = Z ⊕ W . Let P : E → Z denote the projection onto Z and set
P u = z and w = u − P u. Let us point out that Lu = Lw. With this notation, (3.5)
is equivalent to the system
Lw + P H (z + w) = λw,

(3.6)

(I − P )H (z + w) = λz.

(3.7)

The former is called the auxiliary equation and the latter the bifurcation equation.
Lemma 3.3.1 For all (λ, z) ∈ R × Z, the auxiliary equation (3.6) has a unique
solution w = w(λ, z) which is of class C 1 . Moreover there holds: w(λ, 0) = 0,
wz (λ, 0) = 0, and the derivative wλ := dλ w(λ, 0) of w with respect to λ is also zero.
 : R × Z × W → W , defined by F
(λ, z, w) = Lw + P H (z + w) −
Proof Consider F

λw. One finds that Fw (λ, 0, 0) is the restriction of L − λI to W , which is invertible.
Therefore the implicit function theorem applies and yields w(λ, z) with the stated
properties. As for wλ , it suffices to take the derivative with respect to λ of (3.6). One
finds that wλ satisfies Lwλ − λwλ = 0 and hence wλ = 0. The derivative wz (λ, 0) can
be found by differentiating Lw + P H (z + w) − λw = 0. Since H  (0) = 0, one finds

3.4 The Global Inversion Theorem

Lwz (λ, 0) − λwz (λ, 0) = 0, and this, taking into account that wz (λ, 0) ∈ W , implies
wz (λ, 0) = 0.

Remark 3.3.2 If H ∈ C k (E, E) then w is of class C k too, and the derivatives
dzi w(λ, z), i = 1, . . . , k, can be evaluated by differentiating Lw+P H (z+w)−λw = 0
with respect to z.
Remark 3.3.3 The Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction procedure can be carried out if
F ∈ C k (R × X, Y ), where X and Y are Banach spaces.

3.4 The Global Inversion Theorem
Let F be a map between two metric spaces X, Y .
Definition 3.4.1 We say that F : X → Y is proper if F −1 (C) := {u ∈ X : F (u) ∈
C} is compact for all compact sets C ⊂ Y .
Remark 3.4.2 Any proper F maps closed sets into closed sets.
Proposition 3.4.3 Let F ∈ C(X, Y ) be proper and locally invertible in X. Then for
every v ∈ Y the set F −1 ({v}) is finite and its cardinality is locally constant.
Proof Since F is proper, F −1 ({v}) is compact. Moreover, since F is locally invertible on X, F −1 ({v}) is discrete and therefore F −1 ({v}) is finite. Let ui , i = 1, ..., k,
be such that F (ui ) = v. Since F is locally invertible, there exist neighborhoods
Ui ⊂ X of ui and V ⊂ Y of v such that F is a homeomorphism between Ui and V .
We want to show that there is a neighborhood W ⊂ V such that the cardinality of
F −1 ({w})
is k, for every w ∈ W . If not, there exists a sequence vn ∈ V with vn → v
and zn ∈ i=1,...,k Ui such that F (zn ) = vn . From the properness of F we infer that
zn converges, up
 to a subsequence, to some z ∈ X and, by continuity, F (z) = v.
Therefore z ∈ i=1,...,k Ui , a contradiction.


The singular points of F , denoted by  = (F ), make up the set of u ∈ X where
F is not locally invertible. We also define
0 = F −1 (F ()), X0 = X \ 0 , Y0 = Y \ F ().

(3.8)

The following proposition extends Proposition 3.4.3 to maps with singularities.
Proposition 3.4.4 If F ∈ C(X, Y ) is proper, then the cardinality of F −1 ({v}) is
locally constant on every connected component of Y0 .
Proof It suffices to consider the restriction of F to X0 which is locally invertible on


X0 and is proper as a map from X0 to Y0 .
We are now in position to prove the following global inversion theorem.
Theorem 3.4.5 Suppose that F ∈ C(X, Y ) is proper and let us also assume that
X0 is arcwise connected and Y0 is simply connected, where X0 and Y0 are given by

(3.8). Then F is a homeomorphism from X0 onto Y0 . In particular, if  = ∅ then F
is a global homeomorphism from X onto Y .
Proof The fact that F (X0 ) = Y0 follows immediately from Proposition 3.4.4. Let us
prove the injectiveness. We will be brief, referring to [17, pp. 48–52] for a complete
proof.
First, consider the square Q = [0, 1] × [0, 1] and take any u ∈ X0 . Let S ∈
C(Q, Y0 ) be a continuous surface such that S(0, 0) = v := F (u). It is possible to
show that for every such u and S there exists a unique R ∈ C(Q, X0 ) such that
F ◦ R = S.
Next, suppose by contradiction that there exist u0 , u1 ∈ X0 and v ∈ Y0 such that
F (ui ) = v, i = 0, 1. By assumption X0 is arcwise connected and hence there is a
path p ∈ C([0, 1], X0 ) such that p(0) = u0 and p(1) = u1 . The image q = F ◦ p
is a closed curve in Y0 which is simply connected. Thus there exists a homotopy
h ∈ C(Q, Y0 ) such that for all (s, t) ∈ Q there holds
h(s, 0) = q(s),

h(s, 1) = v,

h(0, t) = h(1, t) = v.

From the previous step we can find a unique surface R ∈ C(Q, X0 ) such that
R(0, 0) = u0 and F ◦ R = h on Q. It is easy to check that the following facts
hold:
1. R(1, 0) = u1 ;
2. F (R(0, t)) = h(0, t) = v;
3. F (R(s, t)) = h(s, 1) = v;
4. F (R(1, t)) = h(1, t) = v.
It follows that R is constant on the set
({0} × [0, 1]) ∪ ([0, 1] × {1}) ∪ ({1} × [0, 1]) .
Then R(1, 0) = R(0, 0) = u0 , a contradiction with point 1.

3.5 A Global Inversion Theorem with Singularities
In this section we will deal with a case in which the previous global inversion theorem
does not apply. The first result in this direction has been given in [16].
Let X, Y be Banach spaces and let F ∈ C 2 (X, Y ). We set
  = {u ∈ X : dF (u) is not invertible}.
We shall suppose that u ∈   is an ordinary singular point, namely it satisfies
(i) ∃ φ = φu ∈ X, φ = 0, such that Ker [dF (u)]) = Rφ:
(ii) Range [dF (u)]) is closed and has codimension 1;
(iii) d 2 F (u)[φ, φ] ∈ Range [dF (u)]).

3.5 A Global Inversion Theorem with Singularities

The following theorem gives a precise geometric description of the range of F .
Theorem 3.5.1 Let F ∈ C 2 (X, Y ) be proper and suppose that the singular set   is
nonempty and connected and every u ∈   is an ordinary singular point. Then  is
a connected C 1 manifold of codimension 1 in X.
Moreover, assume that F (u) = v has a unique solution for every v ∈ F (  ).
Then F (  ) is also a connected C 1 manifold of codimension 1 in Y and there exist
Y0 , Y2 ⊂ Y , which are nonempty, open and connected, with the properties
1. Y = Y0 ∪ Y2 ∪ F (  );
2. the equation F (u) = v has no solution if v ∈ Y0 , a unique solution if v ∈ F (  )
and precisely two solutions if v ∈ Y2 .
Above, by a manifold of codimension 1 in X we mean that, locally,  = G−1 (0) for
some G ∈ C 1 (X, R) such that dG(u) = 0 for all u ∈ .
The proof of this theorem will be carried out through several lemmas. In the sequel
v = F (u). First of all, since any u ∈   is an ordinary singular point, there exist
W ⊂ X and Z ⊂ Y such that X = Rφ ⊕ W and Y = Z ⊕ Range [dF (u)]. Moreover,
we can choose ψ ∈ Y ∗ \ {0} such that Range [dF (u)] = Ker [ψ]. Let z ∈ Z be such
that ψ, z = 1 and let P (v) = ψ, vz denote the projection onto Z.
Next, given 
v ∈ Y we look for 
u ∈ X such that dF (
u)[tφ + w] = 
v. Using the
Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction, this equation is equivalent to the system


P dF (
u)[tφ + w] = P
v.
(I − P ) dF (
u)[tφ + w] = (I − P )
v.

(3.9)

Lemma 3.5.2   is a C 1 manifold of codimension 1 in X.
Proof The map (I − P ) dF (u) is invertible as a map from W to Range [dF (u)] and
there exists ε > 0 such that (I − P ) dF (
u) is also invertible provided 
u − u < ε.
Set A = [(I − P ) dF (

w = A
v − tA dF (

Therefore, 
u ∈   ∩ Bε (u) whenever
G(
u) := P dF (

Since
dG(u)[φ] = P d 2 F (u)[φ, φ] = ψ, d 2 F (u)[φ, φ],
and u is an ordinary singular point (cf. condition (iii)), then dG(u)[φ] = 0 and   is
a manifold of codimension 1 in X.

Lemma 3.5.3 F (  ) is a connected C 1 manifold of codimension 1 in Y .

u ∈ X with 
u − u
1, by
setting (
u) = F (
u) + G(
u)z. It is easy to check that d(u) is invertible and hence
 is locally a diffeomorphism. Since G(u) = 0 for all u ∈   it follows that, locally,
−1 (0), where G
 = G ◦  −1 . In addition, d G
 = 0 and the lemma follows.
F (  ) = G


In the next lemma we suppose that ψ, d 2 F (u)[φ, φ] > 0. The case in which
ψ, d 2 F (u)[φ, φ] < 0 requires obvious changes.
Lemma 3.5.4 Suppose that ψ, d 2 F (u)[φ, φ] > 0. Then there exist ε, δ > 0 such
that the equation F (tφ +w) = v+sz, with tφ +w ∈ Bε (u) := {
u ∈ X : 
u−u < ε},
has two solutions for all 0 < s < δ and no solution for all −δ < s < 0.
Proof To simplify notation, we take u = v = 0 and consider the equation F (tφ +
w) = sz. Setting L = dF (0) we get
Lw + ω((tφ + w) = sz,

where ω(0) = 0, dω(0) = 0.

Using again the Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction, we find the system

Lw + P ω((tφ + w) = 0,
(I − P )ω((tφ + w) = sz.
The first of the preceding equations can be handled by the implicit function theorem
yielding a w = w(t) of class C 1 such that w(0) = 0 and dw(0) = 0. Inserting w in
the second equation of the system we find
χ (t) := ψ, ω(tφ + w(t)) = s.
A straight calculation yields
χ  (0) = 0,

χ  (0) = ψ, d 2 F (0)[φ, φ] > 0

and the result follows.

The local result stated in the previous lemma is completed by the following one.
Lemma 3.5.5 For any neighborhood U of u ∈   there exists a neighborhood V of
v = F (u) such that F −1 (V ) ⊂ U .

3.5 A Global Inversion Theorem with Singularities

31

Proof By contradiction, there exists a neighborhood U ∗ of u and a sequence un ∈ U ∗
such that F (un ) → F (u). Using the properness of F , we find that, up to a subsequence, un converges to some u∗ ∈ U ∗ . Moreover, F (u∗ ) = F (u), a contradiction
with respect to the assumption that the equation F (u) = v has a unique solution for
all v ∈ F (  ).


Proof of Theorem 3.5.1 The properties of   and F (  ) are proved in Lemmas 3.5.2
and 3.5.3. Since F (  ) is a (connected) manifold of codimension 1, it is possible
to show that Y \ F (  ) has at most two connected components; see [17, p. 60].
Lemma 3.5.4 jointly with Lemma 3.5.5 imply that the equation F (u) = v has zero
or two solutions for v ∈ F (  ). Therefore Y \ F (  ) has precisely two components
proving statement 1. As for statement 2, it follows from the preceding discussion
and the fact that the cardinality of F −1 (v) is constant on every connected component
of Y \ F (  ).

Chapter 4

Leray–Schauder Topological Degree

To study the number of solutions of equations like
(u) = b,
where  is an open set in a Banach space X,  :  −→ X and b ∈ X, and based
on a similar idea of Brouwer for continuous maps defined in finite-dimensional
spaces, Leray and Schauder [64] introduced a topological tool, called the degree. It
consists in assigning an integer number d(, , b) with the property that the equation
has at least one solution provided that d(, , b) = 0 (the existence property). In
addition, it is desired to have an additivity of the degree, namely if the equation
has only solutions in two disjoint open subsets 1 , 2 of , then deg (, , b) =
deg (, 1 , b) + deg (, 2 , b).
The topological character of the degree is due to the fact that, roughly speaking,
it is possible to deduce the existence of a solution of (u) = b by showing that
the map can be continuously deformed (by a homotopy) on a map 0 for which
the existence of a solution of the equation 0 (u) = b is known. We point out that
this homotopy property is in general not satisfied for the function #(, , b), the
number of solutions of (u) = b in . Indeed, it suffices to think of the example
 = ( − 3, 3) ⊂ X = R, b = 0 and λ (x) = (x − λ)3 − λ2 (x − λ). In this case,
for λ ∈ (0, 1] the equation λ (x) = 0 has exactly three solutions 0, λ, 2λ, while for
λ = 0 there is just one solution, x = 0. This example shows that the definition of
d(, , b) requires some care.
In this chapter we discuss in detail the Leray–Schauder topological degree, which
will be a fundamental tool for the applications to nonlinear problems in infinitedimensional spaces. It is based on the the finite-dimensional Brouwer degree which,
for the sake of brevity, is only sketched in an initial section.

4.1 The Brouwer Degree
The Brouwer degree is now a well known tool, discussed in several books, like [2, 15,
44, 71]. For this reason we will limit ourselves to give the definition of the Brouwer
degree and to outline its main properties without proofs.

4 Leray–Schauder Topological Degree

Let  be a bounded open subset of RN and consider a map f ∈ C(, RN ) and
a point b ∈ RN \ f (∂). The above assumptions will always be understood in the
sequel.

To define the Brouwer degree first we fix some notation. Let f ∈ C(, RN )
C 1 (, RN ). If the components of f (x) are fi (x), we denote by f  (x) the Jacobian of
f at x, namely the matrix

and by Jf (x) the determinant
f  (x). We denote by R the class of all triples (f , , b)
 of
N
1
such that f ∈ C(, R ) C (, RN ) with  a bounded open set in RN , b ∈ f (∂)
and where b is a regular value of f in , namely f  (x) is invertible for every x ∈ 
satisfying f (x) = b.
The definition of the Brouwer degree is given through several steps.
Step 1. Definition of the Brouwer degree in the class R. Assume that (f , , b) ∈ R.
The set {u ∈  : f (u) = b} is finite because b is a regular value of f and  is
bounded. In this case one defines the degree by setting

deg (f , , b) :=

sign (Jf (x)).

(4.1)

f (x)=b

Example 4.1.1 Consider a linear, invertible1 continuous map L : RN → RN . Let
λj (j = 1, . . . , k) denote the characteristic values of L (see Definition 1.3.4). If I
denotes the identity map in RN , we claim that
deg (I − L, Br , 0) = ( − 1)β ,

r > 0,

(4.2)

where β is the sum of the algebraic multiplicities mj of λj ∈ (0, 1).
First let us remark that 0 is a regular value of f = I − L because λ = 1 is not a
characteristic value of L. For the same reason the only solution of f (x) = 0 is x = 0
and (4.1) becomes
deg (I − L, Br , 0) = sign (JI −L (0)).
1

Or, equivalently, that λ = 1 is not a characteristic value of L.

(4.3)

4.1 The Brouwer Degree

35

In order to evaluate sign (JI −L (0)), let us begin by pointing out that the eigenvalues
αj of I − L are given by
λj − 1
αj =
.
λj
Moreover, the algebraic multiplicity of αj is equal to mj , namely to that of λj . If we
write I − L in its Jordan normal form, then its determinant is given by
JI −L (0) =

%
j

αj =

% λj − 1
j

λj

(4.4)

.

Here it is understood that each αj (or λj ) is repeated mj times. Now, remark that
none of αj is zero because λj = 1 by assumption. In addition, the only αj which
contribute to the sign [JI −L (0)] are the real αj < 0, namely the λj ∈ (0, 1). This is
clear if αj > 0. Moreover, if one αj is complex, its complex conjugate αj∗ is also an
eigenvalue of I − L. Hence their product is positive and does not change the sign of
JI −L (0). Therefore, (4.3) yields
deg (I − L, Br , 0) = sign [JI −L (0)] = ( − 1)β ,

where β =

mj .
0<λj <1

This immediately implies (4.2).




Step 2. Extension to continuous maps. To extend the definition of degree to singular
values b of f , one uses the Sard lemma.
Sard Lemma Let f ∈ C 1 (, RN ) and consider the set S(f ) of singular points of
f , i.e., S(f ) = {x ∈  : Jf (x) = 0}. Then the set of singular values, f (S(f )),
has zero Lebesgue measure.
As a direct consequence, the class of functions f ∈ C ∞ (, RN ) for which b is a
regular value is dense in the space C(, RN ), and therefore the degree defined for
R is uniquely extended to a continuous map in the class of triples (f , , b) with
f ∈ C(, RN ),  a bounded open set in RN and b ∈ f (∂).
The main properties of the Brouwer degree are the following.
(P1) Normalization property: deg (I , , b) = 1, for b ∈ , where I is the identity
map.
(P2) Additivity property: If 1 and 2 are open, bounded disjoint subsets in  and
b ∈ f ( \ (1 ∩ 2 )), then deg (f , , b) = deg (f , 1 , b) + deg (f , 2 , b).
(P3) Homotopy property: Let H ∈ C([0, 1] × , RN ) be a homotopy. If b ∈
C([0, 1], RN ) satisfies b(t) ∈ H (t, ∂), for every t ∈ [0, 1], then deg (H (t, .), , b)
is constant. In particular, deg (H (0, .), , b(0)) = deg (H (1, .), , b(1)).
Actually, it has been proved in [5] that the degree is uniquely determined by the
additivity, homotopy and normalization properties. In addition, we list below other
properties of the Brouwer degree that can be deduced from (P1)–(P3). We prove the
first three properties and leave as an exercise to the reader the remaining ones.

36

4 Leray–Schauder Topological Degree

(P4) Solution property: If deg (f , , b) = 0, then b ∈ f (), namely there exists
x ∈  such that f (x) = b.
Proof If b ∈ f (), applying (P2) with 1 = 2 = ∅, we have deg (f , , b) =
2 deg (f , ∅, b) = 0, where the latter equality is also a consequence of (P1) with
1 =  and 2 = ∅.


(P5) Excision property: Let K ⊂  be any compact set such that b ∈ f (K). Then
deg (f , , b) = deg (f ,  \ K, b).
Proof Apply (P2) with 1 =  \ K and 2 = ∅.




(P6) Dependence on the boundary values: deg (f , , b) depends only on the values
of f on ∂, namely if f ∈ C(, RN ) and g ∈ C(, RN ) are such that f|∂ = g|∂ ,
then deg (f , , b) = deg (g, , b).
Proof Apply (P3) with H (t, x) = tf (x) + (1 − t)g(x) and b(t) = b.




(P7) If  ⊂ RN and f ∈ C(, Rn ), with N ≥ n, then deg (f , , b) =
. . × {0}
deg (f |∩Rn ,  ∩ Rn , b). Here we identify Rn with the subset Rn × {0} × (N. −n)
of RN .
(P8) Continuity with respect to b: The degree is constant for b on each connected
component of RN − f (∂).
(P9) Continuity with respect to f : There exists a neighborhood U of f in C(, RN )
such that
deg (f , , b) = deg (g, , b)

∀g ∈ U.

Let us remark that the neighborhood U can be chosen in such a way that b ∈ g(∂)
for any g ∈ U . Hence the deg (g, , b) is well defined.

4.2 The Leray–Schauder Topological Degree
The Brouwer degree has been extended by Leray and Schauder to spaces of infinite
dimension for compact perturbations of the identity.
Let X be a Banach space, and let  be an open subset of X. Consider a compact
map T ∈ C(, X) and let  = I − T where I denotes the identity in X. Let b ∈ 
be such that b ∈ (∂). The Leray–Schauder topological degree (for short, LS
degree) is defined on any triple (, , b) with the above properties. The class of such
(, , b) is denoted by D.
Remark 4.2.1 If X = RN we recover the Brouwer degree defined in the previous
section. As a consequence, the results (and the proofs) given below can be translated
to results for the Brouwer degree.

4.2 The Leray–Schauder Topological Degree

37

Since T is compact, the set (∂) is closed and thus
δ := dist (b, (∂)) > 0.

(4.5)

Moreover, still using the fact that T is compact, we infer that there exists a sequence
of continuous operators Tn with finite-dimensional range, namely Tn () ⊂ Rn , such
that Tn → T , uniformly, (cf. [36, Sect. 6.1]).
Setting n = I − Tn and using (4.5) we deduce that
dist (b, n (∂)) > δ/2 > 0,
provided n is sufficiently large and hence deg ( (I − Tn )|∩Rn ,  ∩ Rn , b) makes
sense.
Moreover, using property (P7) of the Brouwer degree, there exists n0 ≥ 1 such
that
deg ((I − Tn )|∩Rn ,  ∩ Rn , b) = const.

∀ n ≥ n0 .

(4.6)

In addition, this constant is independent of the considered approximation Tn of T ,
as is shown in the following result.
Lemma 4.2.2 If Sn ∈ C(, Rn ) is such that Sn → T uniformly, then
deg ( (I − Sn )|∩Rn ,  ∩ Rn , b) = deg ( (I − Tn )|∩Rn ,  ∩ Rn , b),

∀ n ! 1.

Proof Since both Sn and Tn converge to T , then Sn − Tn  → 0 as n → ∞. Using
property (P9) of the Brouwer degree the lemma follows.


According to these remarks, the following definition is in order.
Definition 4.2.3 If (, , b) ∈ D, then we set
deg (, , b) = lim deg ( (I − Tn )|∩Rn ,  ∩ Rn , b).
n→∞

All the properties of the Brouwer degree hold for the LS degree provided that
(, , b) ∈ D. The reader can check this claim as an exercise. Without changing
notation, we will still refer to these properties as (P1)–(P9).
It is convenient to state explicitly the form that takes the homotopy property.
Proposition 4.2.4 (Homotopy property) Let T ∈ C([0, 1] × , X) be such that
T (t, .) is a compact map for all t ∈ [0, 1]. Define t (u) = u − T (t, u). If b :
[0, 1] −→ X is continuous and t (u) = b(t) for every t ∈ [0, 1] and u ∈ ∂, then
deg (t , , b(t)) = const. ∀t ∈ [0, 1].




Example An interesting homotopy which we will consider is T (t, u) = t T (u) with
T compact and b(t) ≡ b ∈ t (∂) for every t ∈ [0, 1]. In this case,
deg (I − T , , b) = deg (I , , b) = 1.
A more general version of the homotopy property is stated below without proof.

38

4 Leray–Schauder Topological Degree

Proposition 4.2.5. (General homotopy property) Let  be a bounded, open subset
of R × X and let T :  → X be a compact map. For every t ∈ R we consider the
t-slice
t = {u ∈ X : (t, u) ∈ }
and the map t : t → X given by
t (u) = u − T (t, u).
If
t (u) = b,

∀u ∈ ∂t ,

then the topological degree deg (t , t , b) is well defined and independent of t. 

An application of the homotopy property of the LS degree is the fixed point theorem
proved by Juliusz Schauder [80].
Theorem 4.2.6 (Schauder fixed point theorem) If B is a closed ball of a real Banach
space X and T : B −→ B is compact, then T has a fixed point.
Proof Without loss of generality we can assume that B is the closed ball B r of
center 0 and radius r. Observe that the thesis of the theorem is clearly verified if
0 ∈ (I − T )(∂B). On the other hand, if for each u ∈ ∂B, T u = u, then, using in
addition that
tT u < r = u, ∀t ∈ [0, 1), ∀u ∈ ∂B,
we deduce for t = I − tT that 0 ∈ t (∂B), for every t ∈ [0, 1]. By applying the
homotopy property of the degree to the family of compact operators t we get
deg (1 , B, 0) = deg (I , B, 0) = 1.
By the existence property, this implies that 1 has a zero, i.e., T has a fixed point
in B.


Remark 4.2.7 The key issue in the above proof has been to establish that
{u : u − tT (u) = 0 for some t ∈ [0, 1]} ⊂ Br

(4.7)

to apply the homotopy property. The condition (4.7) means that r is an a priori bound
of the solutions of the equation u − tT (u) = 0.
Remark 4.2.8 As a consequence of the Dugundji extension theorem, every closed
convex set D of a normed linear space X is a retract (i.e., there exists a map R :
X −→ X such that Rx = x for every x ∈ D), and the Schauder theorem is also
true if we substitute the closed ball B by any closed bounded convex set D. Indeed,
it suffices to consider a closed ball B containing D and to apply the above theorem
to the composition operator T ◦ R : B −→ D ⊂ B.

Index of an Isolated Zero and Computation
by Linearization

Assume that, for  ∈ C(, RN ), u0 ∈  is an isolated solution of the equation
(u) = 0, i.e., a unique solution of this equation in a neighborhood (say Br0 (u0 ) =
{u ∈ RN : u − u0  < r0 } ⊂ ) of u0 . We deduce then that (, Br (u0 ), 0) ∈ D and
from the excision property that
deg (, Br (u0 ), 0) = deg (, Br0 (u0 ), 0),

∀r ∈ (0, r0 ).

This allows us to define the index of  relative to u0 by setting
i (, u0 ) = lim deg (, Br (u0 ), 0).
r→0

Below, if  = I − T is C 1 , we show how to evaluate the index of  relative to
u0 through the index of its derivative at zero. Up to a translation, we can assume,
without loss of generality, that u0 = 0. As it has been mentioned, in the sequel it is
always understood that the triples considered are (, Bε , 0) ∈ D.
We begin with some preliminary remarks. First of all it is well known that if T
is compact, then the linear map T  (0) is also compact (see, e.g., [15, Lemma 3.17]).
If, in addition,  (0) = I − T  (0) is invertible (λ = 1 is not a characteristic value of
T  (0)), then zero is the unique zero of  (0) and, consequently, deg ( (0), Bε , 0) is
well defined.
Lemma 4.2.9 Suppose that  is of class C 1 such that det [ (0)] = 0. Then
deg (, Bε , 0) = deg ( (0), Bε , 0),
for every sufficiently small ε > 0.
Remark 4.2.10 Under the hypothesis of the previous lemma, there exists a small
ε > 0 such that the equation (u) = 0 has a unique solution u = 0 in the ball Bε
centered at u = 0 with radius ε.
Proof Consider the family of maps

if t ∈ (0, 1],
if t = 0.

Clearly H (t, u) is an admissible continuous homotopy. Otherwise, there exists
(t ∗ , u∗ ) ∈ [0, 1] × ∂ such that H (t ∗ , u∗ ) = 0. From the definition of H and since
0 ∈ ∂ it follows that t ∗ ∈ (0, 1). Hence we have (t ∗ u∗ ) = 0, a contradiction.
Then the result follows by applying the homotopy property.


Let χ (0, 1, T  (0)) denote the set of all characteristic values λ ∈ (0, 1) of T  (0). Since
T  (0) is compact, the set χ (0, 1, T  (0)) is finite (see Theorem 1.3.6). Moreover, let
mult(λ) be the algebraic multiplicity of λ.

40

Theorem 4.2.11 Let T be of class C 1 (, X) and compact. Moreover we suppose
that T  (0) is invertible. Then there holds
i (, 0) = i ( (0), 0) = ( − 1)β ,
where2
β=

mult (λ).
λ∈χ(0,1,T  (0))

Proof Let V ⊂ X be the space spanned by the eigenfunctions corresponding to the
λ’s in χ (0, 1, T  (0)). Then V has dimension β and there exists W ⊂ X such that
X = V ⊕ W . Let P , Q be the projections onto V , W , respectively.
We claim that the homotopy H (t, u) = (1 − t)(u − T  (0)u) + t( − P u + Qu)
(which is a linear map of the type Identity—Compact since −P + Q = I − 2P
where the range of P is finite dimensional) is admissible on B (actually, on any ball
Br ). Indeed, arguing by contradiction, suppose there exists (t ∗ , u∗ ) ∈ [0, 1] × ∂B
such that H (t ∗ , u∗ ) = 0. Writing v = P u∗ ∈ V and w = Qu∗ ∈ W and using that V
and W are invariant by T  (0), this means that
(1 − 2t ∗ )v = (1 − t ∗ )T  (0)v
w = (1 − t ∗ )T  (0)w.
Observe that (1 − 2t ∗ )(1 − t ∗ )−1 < 1 < (1 − t ∗ )−1 for t ∈ (0, 1) and thus, since
T  (0)|V has only eigenvalues greater than one, v = 0. Similarly, since T  (0)|W does
not have eigenvalues greater than one, w = 0; i.e., u∗ = 0, a contradiction. As a
consequence, by the homotopy invariance, Definition 4.2.3 and (4.3), we obtain
deg (I − T  (0), Bε , 0) = deg ( − P + Q, Bε , 0) = deg (I − 2P , Bε , 0) = ( − 1)β .

Continuation Theorem of Leray–Schauder

4.3.1 A Topological Lemma
The following separation lemma (see [44, 87]) will be useful.
Lemma 4.3.1 Let (M, d) be a compact metric space, let A be a connected component
of M and let B be a closed subset of M such that A∩B = ∅. Then there exist compact
sets MA and MB satisfying
• A ⊂ MA , B ⊂ MB .
• M=MA ∪ MB and MA ∩ MB = ∅.
2

If χ(0, 1, T  (0)) = ∅ we set β = 0.

4.3 Continuation Theorem of Leray–Schauder

41

The proof of Lemma 4.3.1 is based on the notion of ε-chainable points.
Definition 4.3.2 Given ε > 0, we say that two points a, b in a compact metric space
M are ε-chainable if there exists a finite number of points x1 , . . . , xn ∈ M such that
x1 = a, xn = b and d(x1 , xi+1 ) < ε for every i = 1, ..., n − 1.
Clearly the relation “to be ε-chainable” is an equivalence relation. Using this it is
easily proved that the set Aε (a) of all points x in M which are ε-chainable is open
and closed in M. As a consequence, if A is a connected set in M, then A ⊂ Aε (a)
for every a ∈ A and, by the transitivity of the relation, the set Aε (a) does not depend
on the choice of the point a ∈ A. We denote this set as Aε in this case and we prove
the following result.
Proposition 4.3.3 Let A be a connected set in M and let ε > 0. If Aε denotes the
set of points in M which
& are ε-chainable with some point in A (thus, with all points
in A), then M0 :=
Aε is connected.
ε>0

Proof We begin by proving that every two points in M0 are δ-chainable for every
δ > 0. Indeed, let b1 , b2 ∈ M0 and δ > 0. By the definition of M0 , each one of
the points bi (i = 1, 2) is δ-chainable with every point in A. The transitive property
implies then that b1 and b2 are δ-chainable.
Now, assume, by contradiction, that M0 is not connected, i.e., that there exist
closed sets C1 , C2 in M0 such that
M0 = C1 ∪ C2 ,

C1 ∩ C2 = ∅.

Since M0 is closed (by intersection of closed sets) in the compact M, we deduce
that C1 and C2 are also disjoint compact. Let δ = dist (C1 , C2 ) > 0. Clearly, every two points c1 ∈ C1 and c2 ∈ C2 are not δ-chainable, contradicting our first
assertion at the beginning of the proof. Therefore, M0 is connected and the proof is
concluded.


Now we are ready to prove the separation Lemma 4.3.1.
Proof of Lemma 4.3.1 It suffices to show that there exists ε > 0 such that
B ∩ Aε = ∅.

(4.8)

Indeed, if the existence of this ε has been stated, then we can take MA = Aε ,
MB = M \ Aε .
To prove (4.8), we argue by contradiction: assume that B ∩ Aε = ∅, for every
ε > 0. This means that fixing a ∈ A and taking, for n ∈ N, εn = n1 , there exists
bn ∈ B such that a and bn are εn -chainable.
 
By the compactness of B, there exists a subsequence bnk of {bn } which converges
to some b ∈ B. We claim that b ∈ Aεk , for every k ∈ N. Indeed, given k ∈ N, we
can choose nk > k such that d(bnk , b) < εk = k1 and hence b is εk -chainable with
bnk . Using also that nk > k, we have bnk ∈ Aεnk ⊂ Aεk and bnk is εk -chainable

42

with every point in A. The claim is proved then by applying the transitive property.
Consequently, b ∈ ∩ Aεk = M0 , where the set M0 is connected by Proposition 4.3.3
k∈N

and contains A. Taking into account that A is a connected component, we get M0 = A
and therefore b0 ∈ M0 = A which implies that A ∩ B = ∅, a contradiction proving
(4.8) and the lemma.

4.3.2 A Theorem by Leray and Schauder
Let X be a real Banach space, let  be a bounded and open subset of X, let a < b
and let T : [a, b] ×  → X be a compact map. For λ ∈ [a, b], consider the equation
(λ, u) = u − T (λ, u) = 0,

u ∈ X.

(4.9λ )

Observe that T can be seen as a family of compact operators
u ∈ X.

Tλ (u) := T (λ, u),
Similarly, we denote λ = I − Tλ . Define

 = {(λ, u) ∈ [a, b] ×  : (λ, u) = 0}.
We use the notation λ for the λ-slice of , i.e., λ = {u ∈  : (λ, u) ∈ }.
Theorem 4.3.4 (Leray–Schauder [64], (see also [50])) Assume that X is a real
Banach space,  is a bounded, open subset of X and  : [a, b] ×  −→ X is given
by (λ, u) = u − T (λ, u) with T a compact map. Suppose also that
(λ, u) = u − T (λ, u) = 0,

∀(λ, u) ∈ [a, b] × ∂.

If
deg (a , , 0) = 0,

(4.10)

then
1. (4.9)λ has a solution in  for every a ≤ λ ≤ b.
2. Furthermore, there exists a compact connected set C ⊂  such that
C ∩ ({a} × a ) = ∅ and C ∩ ({b} × b ) = ∅, (see Fig. 4.1).
Proof 1. First, observe that the homotopy property of the degree implies that
deg (λ , , 0) = const.,

∀λ ∈ [a, b].

Therefore, by (4.10), the constant is not zero. Thus, if λ ∈ [a, b] then deg (λ , ,
0) = 0 and, in particular, from the existence property, (4.9)λ has a solution uλ .
2. We argue by contradiction, supposing that every connected component set
C ⊂  containing points of {a} × a does not intersect {b} × b , (see Fig. 4.2).
Applying Lemma 4.3.1 we deduce that there exist two disjoint compact sets Ma ⊃
C ⊃ {a} × a and Mb ⊃ {b} × b such that  = Ma ∪ Mb . It follows that there
exists a bounded open set O in [a, b] × X such that {a} × a ⊂ C ⊂ Ma ⊂ O,
Mb ∩ O = ∅ and T (λ, u) = u for u ∈ ∂Oλ , with λ ∈ [a, b]. (We are denoting by Oλ
the λ-slice of O, i.e., Oλ = {u : (λ, u) ∈ O}.)
The general homotopy property of the degree implies that
deg (λ , Oλ , 0) = deg (a , Oa , 0)
for a ≤ λ ≤ b. By (4.10) we deduce that deg (b , Ob , 0) = 0 for every λ ∈ [a, b].

However, since b has no zeros in Ob , we get a contradiction, proving case 2. 

Other Continuation Theorems

Let X be a real Banach space and consider a compact map T : R × X → X. We
denote again by  the closed set of the pairs (λ, u) ∈ R × X with u a solution of
(4.9)λ . We prove the existence of continua of solutions in .
Theorem 4.4.1 For λ0 ∈ R, let u0 ∈ X be an isolated solution of the problem (4.9)λ0
such that
i(λ0 , u0 ) = 0.
Then the connected component of  that contains (λ0 , u0 ) is not bounded in R × X.
Proof We argue by contradiction and assume that the connected component, C, of
 that contains (λ0 , u0 ) is bounded. Since u0 is isolated, there exists δ1 > 0 such that
({λ0 } × Bδ1 (u0 )) ∩  = {(λ0 , u0 )}.

(4.11)

For 0 < δ < δ1 , let Uδ be a δ-neighborhood of C, that is
Uδ = {(λ, u) ∈ R × X : dist((λ, u), C) < δ}.
As in the proof of the previous theorem, we can take O ⊂ R × X with ∂O ∩  =
∅, (λ0 , u0 ) ∈ O. Indeed, in the case  ∩ ∂Uδ = ∅, it suffices to choose O = Uδ . In
the other case, since the set K = U δ ∩  is a compact metric space, we can apply
Lemma 4.3.1 to the closed sets C and  ∩∂Uδ to deduce the existence of two disjoint
compact sets A, B of K such that
K = A ∪ B, C ⊂ A.
Taking a neighborhood of A as O we conclude the claim. Hence, the topological
degree deg (I − Tλ , Oλ , 0) is well defined. Further, using the general homotopy
property we derive that deg (I − Tλ , Oλ , 0) is constant for values of λ in a compact
interval. On the other hand, since O is bounded in R × X, there exists ε1 ∈ R+ such
that
Oλ = ∅ if λ ∈ (λ0 − ε1 , λ0 + ε1 ),
which, using that the degree relative to the empty set is zero, implies that
deg (I − Tλ , Oλ , 0) = 0, ∀λ ∈ R,
and hence that deg (I − Tλ0 , Oλ0 , 0) = 0. But, by the excision property of the degree
and (4.11), 0 = deg (I − Tλ0 , θλ0 , 0) = i(λ0 , u0 ), contradicting the hypothesis
i(λ0 , u0 ) = 0.

The next result is useful to prove existence of a continuum with a specific shape (see
Fig. 4.3).
Theorem 4.4.2 Let U ⊂ X be bounded, open and let a, b ∈ R be such that (4.9)λ has
no solution in ∂U , for every λ ∈ [a, b], and that (4.9)b has no solution in U . Let U1 ⊂

U be open such that (4.9)a has no solution in ∂U1 and deg (I − Ta , U1 , 0) = 0. Then
there exists a continuum C in  = {(λ, u) ∈ [a, b] × X : u is a solution of (4.9)λ },
such that
C ∩ ({a} × U1 ) = ∅, C ∩ ({a} × (U \ U1 )) = ∅.
Proof We use the following notation:
K = ([a, b] × U ) ∩ ,
A = ({a} × U 1 ) ∩ K,
B = ({a} × (U \ U1 )) ∩ K.
Since (4.9)b has no solution in U and K is compact, we can consider K ⊂ [a, s] × U
for some s ∈ (a, b).
We argue by contradiction and assume that the theorem is false. By Lemma 4.3.1,
there exist disjoint, compact subsets KA , KB containing respectively A and B, such
that K = KA ∪ KB . Let O be a δ-neighborhood of KA such that dist(O, KB ) > 0.
Hence the Leray–Schauder degree is well defined in Oλ = {u ∈ U : (λ, u) ∈ O} for
every λ ∈ [a, b]. Furthermore, by the general homotopy property, we have
deg (I − Tλ , Oλ , 0) = constant,
and consequently
deg (I − Ta , Oa , 0) = deg (I − Tb , Ob , 0).

(4.12)

On the other hand, since O ∩ KB = ∅, there are no solutions of Eq. (4.9)a in Oa \ U 1
and hence, by the excision property, we deduce that
deg (I − Ta , Oa , 0) = deg (I − Ta , U1 , 0) = 0.
However, by hypothesis we know that Ob = ∅, and thus we conclude that deg (I −

Tb , Ob , 0) = 0. This is a contradiction with (4.12), proving the theorem.

Chapter 5

An Outline of Critical Points

This chapter deals with variational methods. In addition to the existence of minima of
a functional, we discuss the mountain pass theorem, and the linking theorem which
are used to find saddle points. A perturbation method, variational in nature, is studied
in the last section.

5.1

Definitions

Let E be a Hilbert space and J ∈ C 1 (E, R). Then the Fréchet derivative dJ (u) is a
linear continuous map from E to R and hence we can define, by the Riesz theorem,
the gradient J  (u) ∈ E of J at u by setting
(J  (u) | v) = dJ (u)[v],

∀ v ∈ E.

Example 5.1.1 (i) If E = RN and F ∈ C 1 (RN , R), the gradient F  (x) is nothing but
the vector in RN with components Fxi (x), i = 1, . . . , N .
(ii) If E is a Hilbert space with norm  ·  and scalar product (· | ·), for the functional
J (u) = 21 u2 one has dJ (u)[v] = (u | v) and hence J  (u) = u.
(iii) More in general, if A is a linear symmetric operator on E and J (u) = 21 (Au | u),
one has dJ (u)[v] = (Au | v) and hence J  (u) = Au.
An operator T : E → E is called variational if there exists a differentiable functional J : E → R such that T = J  .
A critical point of J is a u ∈ E such that J  (u) = 0. A critical value c is a number
c ∈ R for which there exists a critical point u ∈ E with level J (u) = c. We will see
that, in our applications, critical points are (weak) solutions of differential equations.
Therefore, if T is a variational operator, in order to find the solutions of T (u) = 0 it
suffices to look for the critical points of J , where J  = T .
Below, we will limit ourselves to consider two classical results dealing with the
existence of minima and of saddle points of the mountain pass type.

5 An Outline of Critical Points

Minima

Usually the existence of minima of a functional is deduced as a consequence of the
Weierstrass theorem (see Theorem 1.2.4). For instance, by Corollary 1.2.5, every
functional J ∈ C 1 (E, R) which is coercive (limu→∞ J (u) = +∞) and weakly
lower semicontinuous (w.l.s.c.) (J (u) ≤ lim inf J (un ) if un  u) is bounded from
below and has a global minimum, so that we have the following example.
Example 5.2.1 Consider the functional
J (u) = 21 u2 − H(u),
where H ∈ C 1 (E, R) is weakly continuous (namely un  u ⇒ H(un ) → H(u))
and satisfies
|H(u)| ≤ a1 + a2 uα ,
with a1 , a2 > 0 and α < 2. Then
J (u) ≥ 21 u2 − a1 − a2 uα
and since α < 2, it follows that J is coercive. It is well known that the norm u
is w.l.s.c. This and the fact that H is weakly continuous implies that J is w.l.s.c.
Therefore Corollary 1.2.5 applies and yields a global minimum z ∈ E of J such that
J  (z) = 0, i.e., z = H (z).
Dealing with nonlinear eigenvalue problems, we shall also consider minima constrained on a submanifold M of E. We will focus on the specific situation for
M = G −1 (0), where G ∈ C 1,1 (E, R). If G  (u) = 0 on M, then M is a smooth
manifold in E.
We say that u ∈ M is a local minimum constrained on M for the functional
J ∈ C 1 (E, R) if there exists a neighborhood U of u such that
J (u) ≤ J (v),

∀ v ∈ U ∩ M.

If u is a local minimum of J on M, then there exists λ ∈ R such that J  (u) = λG  (u).
The proof is quite similar to the elementary finite-dimensional case (see Exercise 24).
The value λ is called the Lagrange multiplier.
Example 5.2.2 If G(u) = 21 (u2 − R 2 ), then M is a sphere of radius R and a local
minimum of J on M satisfies J  (u) = λu.

5.3 The Mountain Pass Theorem
The mountain pass theorem deals with the existence of critical points of a functional
J ∈ C 1 (E, R) which has a strict local minimum at, say, u = 0. Specifically, we
assume that it satisfies the following two “geometric” assumptions.

5.3 The Mountain Pass Theorem

49

(J 1) There exist r, ρ > 0 such that J (u) ≥ ρ for all u ∈ E with u = r.
(J 2) ∃ v ∈ E, v > r, such that J (v) ≤ 0 = J (0).
Example 5.3.1 Let J ∈ C 1 (E, R) be a functional of the form
J (u) = 21 u2 − 21 (Au | u) − H(u),
where A is a compact linear bounded symmetric operator in E and H ∈ C 2 (E, R) is
homogeneous of degree α > 2, namely H(tu) = t α H(u) for all t ≥ 0 and all u ∈ E.
This implies that H(0) = 0 and H (0) = 0 as well as d 2 H(0)[v, v] = 0 for all v ∈ E.
Therefore one has that J  (0) = 0 and
d 2 J (0)[v, v] = v2 − (Av | v) − d 2 H(0)[v, v] = v2 − (Av | v).
From this we infer that d 2 J (0) is positive definite provided (Av | v) < v2 for all
v ∈ E, i.e., if A < 1 (since A = supv=1 (Av | v) because A is symmetric).
Consequently, by Theorem 1.3.6, d 2 J (0) is positive definite iff all the eigenvalues
of A are smaller than 1. If this holds, u = 0 is a strict local minimum for J , i.e., (J 1)
is satisfied. Moreover, suppose that H ≡ 0 and let v = 0 be such that H(v) = 0. The
following holds:
J (tv) = 21 t 2 v2 − 21 t 2 (Av | v) − t α H(v).

(5.1)

If H(v) > 0, resp. H(v) < 0, (5.1) and the fact that α > 2 implies that there exists
t ∗ > 0, resp. t ∗ < 0, such that J (t ∗ v) < 0 and (J 2) holds.
Let J ∈ C 1 (E, R) be a functional satisfying the assumptions (J 1)–(J 2). Without
loss of generality, we can also assume (to simplify notation) that J (0) = 0. Consider
the class of all paths joining u = 0 and u = v,
 = {γ ∈ C([0, 1], E) : γ (0) = 0, γ (1) = v}
and set
c = inf max J (γ (t)).

(5.2)

γ ∈ t∈[0,1]

Clearly, the class  is not empty and, by (J 1)–(J 2), c ≥ ρ > 0. We expect that there
exists at least a critical point of J at the min–max level c. However, even in finite
dimension, this is in general false without the assumption of additional hypotheses.
Indeed, for E = R2 we have the following example due to Brezis and Nirenberg.
The functional J (x, y) = x 2 + (1 − x)3 y 2 has a unique critical point, which is the
origin (0, 0). Since J (x, y) = x 2 + y 2 + o(x 2 + y 2 ) as (x, y) → (0, 0), it follows
that (0, 0) is a strict local minimum for J , namely (J 1) holds. Moreover
J (t, t) = t 2 + (1 − t)3 t 2 → −∞,
and hence (J 2) holds, too.

as t → +∞

5 An Outline of Critical Points

The additional hypothesis that we need in order to show that c is a critical value
is the following “compactness” condition:
(P S)c Every sequence {un } such that
(i) J (un ) → c,
(ii) J  (un ) → 0,
has a converging subsequence.
This condition is usually called the (local) Palais–Smale condition at level c and
the sequences {un } satisfying (i)–(ii) are called (P S)c sequences.
Notice that (P S)c is equivalent to the following two conditions:
(a) If the sequence {un } satisfies {J (un )} −→ c and un  −→ +∞, then there
exists c > 0 such that J  (un ) ≥ c for n sufficiently large.
(b) Every bounded sequence {un } with {J (un )} −→ c and {J  (un )} −→ 0 possesses
a convergent subsequence.
The second one is a compactness condition which is satisfied in many cases (see
Lemma 7.1.1), while the first condition means that every sequence of points {un } with
level near c ({J (un )} −→ c) and that are almost critical points ({J  (un )} −→ 0) are
a priori bounded, i.e., there exists M > 0 such that un  ≤ M.
The reader should observe that (a) is more general than the standard a priori
estimate for the solutions of the variational equation J  (u) = 0 (see Remark 4.2.7).
Actually, there are examples in which a functional J has an unbounded sequence of
critical points but satisfies the (P S)c condition for every c ∈ R (see [15, 18, 77]).
Given a ∈ R, let us consider the sublevel J a = {u ∈ E : J (u) ≤ a} of J .
The Palais–Smale condition allows us to deform sublevels J a of the functional J .
Specifically, we have the following deformation lemma.
Lemma 5.3.2 Suppose that b ∈ R is not a critical value of J ∈ C 1,1 (E, R) and that
(P S)b holds. Then there exist δ > 0 and a map η ∈ C(E, E) such that η(J b+δ ) ⊂
J b−δ . Moreover, η(u) = u for all u ∈ J b−2δ .
Proof The (P S)b condition and the assumption that b is not a critical value of J
mean that there exists δ > 0 satisfying
J  (u) ≥ δ,

∀ u ∈ J −1 ([b − δ, b + δ]).

Thus, we can construct ([76]) a vector field W ∈ C 0,1 (E, E) in such a way that

−J  (u)J  (u)−2 , if b + δ ≥ J (u) ≥ b − δ,
W (u) =
0,
if J (u) ≤ b − 2 δ,
and consider the Cauchy problem
φ  = W (φ),

φ(0) = u.

Since W is bounded, it is easy to check that the flow φ t (u) is defined for all t ≥ 0.
Let us point out that for any u ∈ J b+δ the following holds (the dependence on u is

5.3 The Mountain Pass Theorem

51

understood):
dJ (φ t )
= (J  (φ t ), (φ t ) ) = (J  (φ t ), W (φ t )) ≤ 0.
dt

(5.3)

In particular, J (φ t (u)) is decreasing with respect to t ≥ 0. Take T = 2δ. We
claim that η(u) = φ T (u) is the map we are looking for. Otherwise, for some u ∈
J b+δ − J b−δ , we have J (φ T (u)) > b − δ and W (φ s (u)) = −J  (u)J  (u)−2 for
all 0 ≤ s ≤ T . Hence (5.3) yields (J  (φ s ), W (φ s )) = −1, and
J (φ T (u)) = J (φ 0 (u)) − T = J (u) − T ≤ b + δ − T = b − δ,
which is a contradiction, proving the claim. The last statement follows immediately
from the fact that W ≡ 0 on J b−2δ .


Remark 5.3.3 The preceding proof highlights that

b is not a critical value
⇔ ∃δ > 0 : J  (u) ≥ δ, ∀u ∈ J −1 ([b − δ, b + δ]).
and (P S)b holds
Remark 5.3.4 Using the notion of pseudo-gradient vector field, the hypothesis that
J is of class C 1,1 can be weakened by assuming that J is C 1 . For details we refer
to [15, pp. 120–123].
Remark 5.3.5 A deformation lemma for a functional J constrained on a smooth
manifold M = G −1 (0) ⊂ E can also be proved. It suffices to substitute J  with the
constrained gradient
∇M J (u) = J  (u) −

(J  (u), G  (u)) 
G (u),
G  (u)2

(5.4)

which is nothing but the projection of J  (u) on the tangent space Tu M = {v ∈ E :
(G  (u) | v) = 0}.
We are now in position to prove the mountain pass theorem
Theorem 5.3.6 (Mountain pass) If J ∈ C 1 (E, R) satisfies (J 1)–(J 2) and (P S)c
holds, then c ≥ ρ > 0 is a positive critical value for J . Precisely, there exists z ∈ E
such that J (z) = c > 0 and J  (z) = 0. In particular, z = 0 and z = v.
Proof If, by contradiction, there is no critical point at level c, then Lemma 5.3.2
and Remark 5.3.4 allow us to find ε ∈ (0, 2c ) and a continuous map η : E → E such
that J (η(u)) ≤ c − ε, for all u ∈ E such that J (u) ≤ c + ε. Moreover, η is such
that η(u) = u provided J (u) ≤ c − 2ε. In particular, η(0) = 0 and η(v) = v. By
the definition of c, there exists γ ∈  such that maxt∈[0,1] J (γ (t)) < c + ε. As a
consequence, the path η ◦ γ belongs to . On the other hand, maxt∈[0,1] J (η ◦ γ (t)) ≤
c − ε < c, which contradicts the definition of c.


Remark 5.3.7 (i) J can be unbounded from above and from below.

5 An Outline of Critical Points

(ii) The mountain pass critical point is, in general, a saddle point: if it is nondegenerate, then its Morse index is 1. By definition, a critical point u of J is nondegenerate if J  (u) is invertible. In such a case, its Morse index is, by definition, the
number of eigenvalues of J  (u) smaller than 0.
(iii) Observe that the proof is based on the fact that every continuous curve in E
joining u = 0 with v has to cross the sphere u = r.
Expanding the preceding remark (iii), we say that a closed subset S of E links the
relative boundary ∂Q of a submanifold Q of E if S ∩ ∂Q = ∅ and for every map
h ∈ C(Q, E), such that h(u) = u for every u ∈ ∂Q, there holds h(Q) ∩ S = ∅.
There are other situations in which it is possible to find a min–max critical value
of a functional J with properties similar to the mountain pass. Let us focus on
the following case, which will be used in the sequel to find solutions of an elliptic
equation. Fixing u ∈ E \ {0}, suppose that
lim J (tu) = −∞.

(5.5)

|t|→∞

Let W denote the subspace orthogonal to Ru and assume that
inf{J (w) : w ∈ W } > −∞.

(5.6)

Consider the class of paths

 = {γ ∈ C([0, 1], E) : γ (0) = −tu, γ (1) = tu},
where t ! 1 is taken in such a way that J ( ± tu) < inf{J (w) : w ∈ W } and define

c := inf max J (γ (s)),
γ ∈
 s∈[0,1]

Theorem 5.3.8 If (5.5) and (5.6) hold and the Palais–Smale condition holds at the
level 
c, then 
c is a critical value of J .
Proof Each γ ∈ 
 crosses W and hence 
c is a finite number greater than inf{J (w) :
w ∈ W }. Repeating the arguments carried out to prove the mountain pass theorem,
it follows that 
c is a critical value for J provided the Palais–Smale condition holds
at the level 
c.


Observe that the hypotheses (5.5) and (5.6) imply that W and a large sphere of Ru
link. More generally, it was proved by P.H. Rabinowitz that the result is also true if
the sphere is taken in a finite-dimensional subspace.
Theorem 5.3.9 (Saddle point theorem) Let E = V ⊕ W with V finite dimensional.
Assume also that J ∈ C 1 (E, R) satisfies for some R > 0 that
ρ := inf{J (w) : w ∈ W } >

max

v∈V , v=R

J (v),

and (P S)c holds. If  is the set of all continuous maps h from the ball in V of radius R
and center 0 into E such that its restriction to the boundary of the ball is the identity,
then 
c = inf h∈ maxv=R J (h(v)) ≥ ρ is a critical value for J .

5.4 The Ekeland Variational Principle

53

Proof It suffices to observe that W and the sphere in V of radius R are linked (see
Exercise 20) and to use similar arguments to the previous ones. The details are left
to the reader.



5.4 The Ekeland Variational Principle
As another application of the deformation Lemma 5.3.2 we will prove a version of
the Ekeland variational principle [46]. For simplicity, we will consider a specific
case dealing with a Hilbert space and a C 1 functional.
Theorem 5.4.1 Let E be a Hilbert space and let J ∈ C 1 (E, R) be bounded from
below. Then:
1. For every δ > 0, there exists u ∈ E such that J (u) ≤ inf E J +δ and J  (u) ≤ δ.
2. In particular, if (P S)c holds for the level c = inf E J , then J attains its infimum.
Proof Set b := inf E J . If the assertion in case 1 does not hold, then an application
of Lemma 5.3.2 and Remark 5.3.3 allows the construction of η ∈ C(E, E) which
maps the sublevel J b+δ into J b−δ , contradicting the definition of b. With respect to
the proof of case 2, it is sufficient to observe that by choosing δn = 1/n, n ∈ N, we
find a minimizing Palais–Smale sequence at level inf E J .


The complete assertion of the general Ekeland principle [46] is the following one.
Theorem 5.4.2 Assume that (X, d) is a complete metric space and that J : X →
R ∪ {+∞} is a l.s.c. functional bounded from below with J ≡ +∞. If, for some
ε > 0, a point uε ∈ X satisfies J (uε ) < inf X J + ε, then there exists vε ∈ X such
that
J (vε ) ≤ J (uε ),
d(uε , vε ) ≤ 1,
J (z) > J (vε ) − εd(vε , z),

∀z = vε .



Remark 5.4.3 1. Notice that in general the functional J does not have to attain its
infimum. However, the above theorem states that the pertubed functional J (z) +
εd(vε , z) does attains its infimum (at vε ).
2. It is also possible to use the general Ekeland principle to give an alternative proof
of the mountain pass Theorem 5.3.6. Indeed, we will follow this approach in
Chap. 12 to extend this theorem to functionals which are differentiable along
some particular directions.
Similar arguments to those used in Theorem 5.4.1 can be applied to prove the
existence of minima constrained on a submanifold M = G −1 (0) ⊂ E such that
G ∈ C 1,1 (E, R). In this case, we say that the functional J constrained on M satisfies

54

5 An Outline of Critical Points

the Palais–Smale condition (P S)c at level c if every sequence {un } in M such that
J (un ) → c and ∇M J (un ) → 0 has a converging subsequence.
Theorem 5.4.4 Let J ∈ C 1 (E, R) be bounded from below on M = G −1 (0) where
G  (u) = 0 on M. Let m := inf M J (u) > −∞ and suppose that (P S)m holds. Then
any minimizing sequence has a converging subsequence. In particular, there exists
u ∈ M and λ ∈ R such that J (u) = m and J  (u) = λG  (u).
Proof Let wn be a minimizing sequence for J constrained on M. Then by
Lemma 5.3.2 and Remark 5.3.5, there exists un ∈ M such that un − wn  → 0,
J (un ) → m and ∇M J  (un ) → 0. Using the (P S)m condition it follows that un (and
so wn ) converges (up to a subsequence) to some u ∈ M. Obviously J (u) = m and

∇M J (u) = 0, i.e., by (5.4), J  (u) = λG  (u) with λ = (J  (u), G  (u))/G  (u)2 . 

5.5 Another Min–Max Theorem
The mountain pass theorem can be extended to cover the case in which u = 0 is not
a local minimum but a saddle point. As before, we assume without loss of generality
that J (0) = 0.
Let E = V ⊕ W , where V is a closed subspace with dim(V ) = k < +∞ and
W = V ⊥ . We denote by SW (r) the sphere in W of radius r, i.e., SW (r) = {w ∈ W :
w = r}. We consider the following hypotheses (see Fig. 5.1).
(J 3) There exist r, ρ > 0 such that
J (w) ≥ ρ,

∀ w ∈ SW (r).

(J 4) There exist R > 0 and w∗ ∈ W , with w∗  > r such that, letting N = {u =
v + sw∗ : v ∈ V , v ≤ R, s ∈ [0, 1]}, one has that
J (u) ≤ 0,

∀ u ∈ ∂N.

Example 5.5.1 Completing Example 5.3.1, consider again the functional J given
by J (u) = 21 u2 − 21 (Au | u) − H(u), with H α-homogeneous for some α > 2. Let
μ1 > μ2 ≥ μ3 ≥ · · · denote the characteristic values of A. If ei = 0 is such that
2
μi Aei = ei , it follows that (J  (0)ei | ei ) = ei 2 − (Aei | ei ) = (1 − μ−1
i )ei  .

Hence, letting V = span{e1 , . . . , ek }, we deduce that J (0) is positive definite on
W = V ⊥ , provided μk+1 < 1, and this suffices to find r, ρ > 0 such that
J (w) ≥ ρ,

∀ w ∈ SW (r),

and thus (J 3) holds.
On the other hand, assuming in addition that 1 ≤ μk and H ≥ 0, we can also see
 = V ⊕ R
that (J 4) holds as well. Indeed, let us fix 
w ∈ W with 
w = 1 and set V
w.

Then, for all 
v∈
S = {
v∈V
v = 1}, one has

v) ≤ 0 for all t ≥ 
t and all
v∈
S. Let R = max{r, 
t}. Take
w and consider the set N defined in (J 4). The preceding argument shows
w∗ = R
that J (u) ≤ 0 for all u = v + sw∗ on the part of ∂N with s > 0. Moreover, J
is also smaller than or equal to zero on the part of the boundary of N with s = 0.
Actually, since 1 ≤ μk , J  (0) = I − A is semi-negative defined on V , and then
J (v) = 21 [v2 − (Av | v)] − H(v) ≤ 0. This proves that (J 4) holds.
The set N can be identified with {u = (v, s) ∈ V × [0, 1] : v ≤ R}. Extending the
class , we consider the class of maps
k = {g ∈ C(N , E) : g(v, s) = (v, s),

∀ (v, s) ∈ ∂N }.

Lemma 5.5.2 For any g ∈ k , there exists ug ∈ N such that g(ug ) ∈ SW (r).
Proof If g ∈ k we set g(v, s) = (v , s  ). Define the auxiliary map g ∗ ∈ C(N , V ×R)
by setting
g ∗ (v, s) = (v , s  w∗  − r).
By the definition of k , we have that g(v, s) = (v, s) for all (v, s) ∈ ∂N . Then
g ∗ (v, s) = (v, sw∗  − r),

∀ (v, s) ∈ ∂N.

(5.7)

This and w∗  > r imply that
g ∗ (v, s) = (0, 0),

∀ (v, s) ∈ ∂N.

(5.8)

56

5 An Outline of Critical Points

Actually, if the first component of g ∗ (v, s) is zero for some (v, s) ∈ ∂N , then (5.7)
yields v = 0. Hence s = 1 and, still using (5.7), we find that the second component
of g ∗ (v, s) is w∗  − r > 0. From (5.8) it follows that we can evaluate the topological
degree deg (h∗ , N0 , (0, 0)), where N0 = int(N ) is the interior of N . Consider the map

g (v, s) = (v, sw∗  − r) and note that deg (
g , N0 , (0, 0)) = 1, because w∗  > r.
Since g(v, s) = 
g (v, s) on ∂N , one infers from property (P6) of the degree (see
Chap. 4) that
deg (g ∗ , N0 , (0, 0)) = deg (
g , N0 , (0, 0)) = 1,
and there exists (vg , sg ) ∈ N such that g ∗ (vg , sg ) = (0, 0). By the definition of g ∗ this


means that ug = (vg , sg ) verifies: g(ug ) ∈ W and g(ug ) = r.
Theorem 5.5.3 Let J ∈ C 1 (E, R) satisfy (J 3)−(J 4) and, setting
c = inf max J (g(u)),
g∈k u∈N

suppose that (P S)c holds. Then there exists z ∈ E such that J (z) = c > 0 and
J  (z) = 0.
Proof By Lemma 5.5.2, for any g ∈ k , there exists ug ∈ N such that g(ug ) ∈ SW (r).
Therefore, by (J 3),
max J (g(u)) ≥ J (g(ug )) ≥ ρ > 0,
u∈N

∀ g ∈ k ,

and this implies that c ≥ ρ > 0. The rest of the proof is similar to that of the mountain
pass theorem.


Remark 5.5.4 If V = {0}, then Theorem 5.5.3 becomes the mountain pass theorem.
Actually, if V = {0}, the class k is nothing but  and c coincides with the mountain
pass critical value.
Theorem 5.5.3 is a specific case of more general results which are referred to
as linking theorems. A linking theorem in which V has infinite dimension has been
proven in [30].

5.6

Some Perturbation Results

Let E be a Hilbert space, I ∈ C 2 (E, R) and let G ∈ C 2 (R × E, R) be a family of
functionals depending on a real parameter ε. We are interested in the critical points of
Iε (u) = I(u) + Gε (u),
where Gε (u) = G(ε, u). The functional I plays the role of the unperturbed functional
and G is the perturbation. The specific situation we are interested in is the case in
which the unperturbed functional has a finite-dimensional manifold Z of critical
points and we look for these z ∈ Z from which emanate solutions of Iε = 0.

5.6 Some Perturbation Results

57

The fact that G plays the role of a perturbation term is formulated in the following
assumption:
(A1)

Gε (z) → 0,

as ε → 0,

uniformly in z ∈ Z.

Let Tz Z denote the tangent space to Z at z, let W = (Tz Z)⊥ and let P denote the
projection from E onto W . Writing u = z + w, with z ∈ Z and w ∈ W , and using a
Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction, the equation Iε (u) = 0 is equivalent to the system

P Iε (z + w) = 0,
(5.9)
(I − P )Iε (z + w) = 0.
The former equations are nothing but forms of the auxiliary equation.
We further assume that there exists c > 0 such that, for ε small enough,
(A2)

[P Iε (z)]−1  ≤ c,

uniformly in z ∈ Z.

For any z ∈ Z fixed, assumption (A2) allows us to define the map Sε : Bε,c −→ W
by setting
Sε (w) = w − [P Iε (z)]−1 (P Iε (z + w)),

(5.10)

where Bε,c denotes the ball
Bε,c = {w ∈ W : w ≤ 2cGε (z)}.
Remark 5.6.1 (A1) implies that the ball Bε,c shrinks to w as ε → 0.
Let us point out that if w is such that Sε (w) = w then u = z + w is a solution of
the auxiliary equation.
In order to find a fixed point of Sε a last assumption is in order:
(A3)

Iε (z + w) − Iε (z) ≤

1
,
2c

uniformly in z ∈ Z and w ∈ Bε,c .

Remark 5.6.2 (i) If Iε (u) = I(u) + εG(u), assumptions (A1) and (A2) are trivially
verified (see also Remark 5.6.1). As for (A2), it can be substituted by requiring that
P I  (z) be invertible. As we will see in the sequel, the invertibility of P I  (z) is
closely related to a suitable non-degeneracy of the manifold Z.
(ii) If G(ε, u) = εG(u), the auxiliary equation becomes
P I  (z + w) + εG  (z + w) = 0
and can be solved near Z directly by means of the implicit function theorem, provided P I  (z) is invertible. On the other hand, in some applications, like the one
discussed in Sect. 13.2, we need to work with perturbations in the general form
G(ε, u) for which the implicit function theorem cannot be applied.
Let us show that Sε has a fixed point in Bε,c .

58

5 An Outline of Critical Points

Lemma 5.6.3 For ε small enough, Sε (Bε,c ) ⊂ Bε,c and Sε is a contraction. Therefore, Sε has a unique fixed point wε,z ∈ Bε,c . In particular, wε,z  ≤ 2cIε (z) and
thus wε,z  → 0 as ε → 0.
Proof For v, w ∈ Bε,c there exists 
v belonging to the segment joining v and w such
that
Sε (v) − Sε (w) = Sε (
v)[v − w],
for some 
v ∈ Bε,c . One has
Sε (
v)[v − w] = v − w − [P Iε (z)]−1 (P Iε (z +
v)[v − w])
= [P Iε (z)]−1 (P Iε (z)[v − w] − P Iε (z +
v)[v − w]).
Using (A3) we infer
Sε (
v)[v − w] ≤ [P Iε (z)]−1  · P Iε (z)[v − w] − P Iε (z +
v)[v − w]
≤ 21 v − w

(5.11)

and this suffices to show that Sε is a contraction on Bε,c . Furthermore, the following
holds:
Sε (0) = [P Iε (z)]−1  · P Iε (z) ≤ cGε (z).
Using this equation and (5.11) it follows that
Sε (w) ≤ Sε (0) + Sε (w) − Sε (0) ≤ cGε (z) + 21 w.
For w ∈ Bε,c one has that w ≤ 2cGε (z) and hence we deduce
Sε (w) ≤ 2cGε (z).
This shows that Sε (Bε,c ) ⊂ Bε,c and completes the proof.




It is now convenient to restrict ourselves to a manifold Z with coordinates ξ ∈ Rn .
To simplify the exposition, we will carry out the proof in the case that ξ = s ∈ R.
The general case requires minor changes.
We will write zε (s) to denote the solution of the auxiliary equation found in
Lemma 5.6.3 and define the function w : Z → W by setting wε (s) = wε,zε (s) . Some
properties of wε (s) are stated in the following lemma.
Lemma 5.6.4 The function wε (s) is of class C 1 and the derivative wε (s) satisfies
|wε (s)| → 0 as ε → 0, uniformly with respect to s ∈ Z.
Proof Since wε (s) has been found by using the Banach contraction principle, it
easily follows that w is C 1 . To compute the derivative wε let us remark that wε
satisfies P Iε (z + wε ) = 0, namely (we understand the dependence upon s)
Iε (z + wε ) = Iε (z + wε )(z + wε )

z

|z |2

Furthermore, using (A1) and again the fact that wε → 0, we infer
Iε (z + wε ) = Iε (z) + Iε (z + θ wε ) = O(ε),

(θ ∈ [0, 1]).

From the preceding estimates we deduce that
P Iε (z + wε )wε = o(1).
Finally, (A2) yields that wε → 0 as ε → 0.

Using Lemma 5.6.3 we can define the reduced functional by setting

Bifurcation Theory

In this chapter we are concerned with bifurcation theory. We discuss the local bifurcation from a simple eigenvalue found by analytical methods, the bifurcation from
an odd eigenvalue by using the topological degree and the Krasnoselskii result on
variational operators. The Rabinowitz global bifurcation theorem is also proved.

6.1

Local Results

Let X and Y be Banach spaces and consider the equation
F (λ, u) = 0,

u ∈ X,

where F : R × X −→ Y satisfies F (λ, 0) ≡ 0. We say that λ∗ is a bifurcation point
of F (λ, u) = 0 if there exists a sequence (λn , un ) ∈ R × X, with un = 0, such that
λn −→ λ∗ and F (λn , un ) = 0.
A particular case is that when X = Y = E is a Hilbert space and the equation is
given by
Lu + H (u) = λu,

u ∈ E,

(6.1)

where L : E −→ E is linear and compact and H ∈ C 1 (E, E) is such that H (0) = 0,
H  (0) = 0.
Denoting by 0 the set of nontrivial solutions of (6.1), namely
0 = {(λ, u) ∈ R × X : Lu + H (u) = λu, u = 0},
and taking the closure  of 0 , we see that λ∗ ∈ R is a bifurcation point of (6.1) if
and only if (λ∗ , 0) ∈ .
Lemma 6.1.1 If λ∗ is a bifurcation point of (6.1) then λ∗ belongs to the spectrum
of L.
Proof The equation F (λ, u) := Lu + H (u) − λu = 0 has the trivial solution u = 0
for all λ ∈ R. Since H  (0) = 0, one has that du F (λ, 0)[v] = Lv + H  (0)[v] − λv =

Lv − λv. If λ ∈ σ (L), then du F (λ, 0) is invertible and the implicit function theorem
yields a neighborhood of (λ, 0) such that the unique solution of (6.1) is u = 0. This
proves that λ is not a bifurcation point.


We will give below conditions under which an eigenvalue of L is a bifurcation point.

6.1.1

Bifurcation from a Simple Eigenvalue

Let us suppose that there exist λ∗ ∈ R and ϕ ∈ E \ {0} such that
(L1) Z := Ker (L − λ∗ I ) = Rϕ;
(L2) the codimension of W = Range (L − λ∗ I ) is one and W = Z ⊥ .
Usually, this case is referred as the simple eigenvalue case. If (L1)–(L2) hold then
E = Z ⊕ W and any u ∈ E can be written in a unique way as u = αϕ + w, with
α ∈ R and w ∈ W . Moreover, we can use the Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction (see
Sect. 3.3) to write (6.1) as the system

Lw + H (αϕ + w) = λw,
(auxiliary equation);
(I − P )H (αϕ + w) = λαϕ, (bifurcation equation).
According to Lemma 3.3.1, the auxiliary equation has a unique solution w(λ, α) ∈ W ,
defined in a neighborhood  × U ⊂ R × R of (λ∗ , 0) ∈ R × R. Substituting into the
bifurcation equation, we have to look for solutions of
(I − P )H (αϕ + w(λ, α)) − λαϕ = 0,
which is equivalent to
S(λ, α) := (H (αϕ + w(λ, α)) | ϕ) − λα = 0.

(6.2)

Suppose that H ∈ C (E, E). Then the function S :  × U → R is of class C and,
according to the properties stated in Lemma 3.3.1, S(λ, 0) = 0 holds, for all λ ∈ 
and Sα (λ∗ , 0) = 0. In order to de-singularize S, we introduce the function
⎧
S(λ, α)
⎪
⎨
if α = 0;
α
σ (λ, α) =
⎪
⎩
Sα (λ, 0) if α = 0.

The function σ is of class C 1 in  × U and σ (λ∗ , 0) = Sα (λ∗ , 0) = 0. Moreover,
one has
Sλ (λ∗ , α)
.
σλ (λ∗ , 0) = lim
α→0
α
Since H  (0) = 0, a straight calculation shows:
Sλ (λ∗ , α) = (H  (0)[wλ (λ∗ , 0)] | ϕ) − α = −α,
and hence σλ (λ∗ , 0) = −1. Then we can apply the implicit function Theorem 3.2.1 to
σ (λ, α) = 0, yielding λ = λ(α) such that σ (λ(α), α) = 0 for all α in a neighborhood

of α = 0. It is clear that the family (λα , uα ) := (λ(α), αϕ + w(λ(α), α)) is a solution
set of (6.1). Moreover, from (uα | ϕ) = α it follows that uα = 0 provided α = 0. In
conclusion, we have proved the following.
Theorem 6.1.2 Let L : E → E be a linear compact operator and suppose that λ∗
is a simple eigenvalue of L. Moreover, let H ∈ C 2 (E, E) be such that H (0) = 0,
H  (0) = 0. Then λ∗ is a bifurcation point of (6.1). More precisely, the bifurcation


set  is, near (λ∗ , 0), a continuous curve.
The preceding result is a particular case of a more general one, dealing with the
bifurcation for an equation as F (λ, u) = 0, where F : R × X → Y , and X, Y are
Banach spaces. Here we will limit ourselves to state a result, referring for more
details to, e.g., [16, Chap. 5] or [15, Chap. 2].
Let F ∈ C 2 (R × X, Y ) be such that F (λ, 0) ≡ 0. We suppose that there exists
∗
λ ∈ R, ϕ ∈ X such that
(F.1) Ker [du F (λ∗ , 0)] = span{ϕ}.
Moreover, let Y0 ⊂ Y denote the range of du F (λ∗ , 0) ∈ L(X, Y ) and assume
(F.2) Y0 is closed and its codimension is 1,
(F.3) dλ,u F (λ∗ , 0)[ϕ] ∈ Y0 .
Let us point out that, in the case in which X = Y = E and F (λ, u) = Lu−λu+H (u),
(L1) is nothing but (F.1). Moreover, Y0 = (Ker [du F (λ∗ , 0)])⊥ and dλ,u F (λ∗ , 0)[ϕ] =
−ϕ, and hence (L2) is nothing but (F.2)–(F.3).
Theorem 6.1.3 Let F ∈ C 2 (X, Y ) be such that F (λ, 0) ≡ 0 and assume that (F.1)–
(F.3) hold. Then λ = λ∗ is a bifurcation point for F (λ, u) = 0. Precisely, from (λ∗ , 0)
branches off a curve of nontrivial solutions of F (λ, u) = 0.

6.1.2

Bifurcation from an Odd Eigenvalue

In this subsection we will give a theorem due to Krasnoselskii which deals with the
case that L and H are compact. We use the same notation as in Theorem 6.1.2. It is
also understood that H (0) = 0 and H  (0) = 0.
Theorem 6.1.4 Suppose that L and H are compact C 1 operators in a Banach space
X with H (0) = 0 and H  (0) = 0 and let λ∗ be an eigenvalue of L with odd finite
(algebraic) multiplicity. Then λ∗ is a bifurcation point for Lu + H (u) = λu.
Proof Let us remark that λ∗ = 0 is an isolated eigenvalue of L. Setting
(λ, u) = Lu + H (u) − λu,
one has that u (λ, 0) = L − λI . Then there exists ε0 > 0 such that the unique
eigenvalue of L contained in the interval [λ∗ − ε0 , λ∗ + ε0 ] is λ∗ . In particular, we can

64

6 Bifurcation Theory

evaluate the Leray–Schauder index of u = 0 by linearization (see Theorem 4.2.11)
yielding
i((λ∗ − ε, 0), 0) = i(L − (λ∗ − ε)I , 0) = ( − 1)β1 ,

∀ 0 < ε ≤ ε0 ,

where β1 is the sum of the algebraic multiplicity mult(λ) of all eigenvalues λ with
λ ≤ λ∗ − ε.
Similarly,
i((λ∗ + ε, 0), 0) = i(L − (λ∗ + ε)I , 0) = ( − 1)β2 , ∀ 0 < ε ≤ ε0 ,

∗
∗
where β2 =
λ≤λ∗ +ε mult(λ). Then β2 = β1 + mult(λ ) and, since λ has odd
algebraic multiplicity, it follows that
i((λ∗ + ε, 0), 0) = −i((λ∗ − ε, 0), 0).

(6.3)

On the other hand, if by contradiction λ∗ is not a bifurcation point, then there exists
ε1 ∈ (0, ε0 ) such that for all ε ∈ (0, ε1 ) there holds
(λ, u) = 0,

∀ λ ∈ [λ∗ − ε, λ∗ + ε],

∀ u = ε.

(6.4)

This immediately implies that
i((λ∗ + ε, 0), 0) = i((λ∗ − ε, 0), 0),
a contradiction with (6.3), proving the theorem.




Remark 6.1.5 The above proof highlights that, even if L and H are only continuous
and compact operators, λ∗ is a bifurcation point of the equation (λ, u) = 0 provided
that there exists a change of the index of i((λ, 0), 0) as λ crosses λ = λ∗ .

6.2

Bifurcation for Variational Operators

In this section we will suppose that L and H are variational operators in a Hilbert
space E, namely:
(A1 ) L ∈ L(E, E) is a symmetric Fredholm operator with index zero and there
exists a functional H ∈ C k (E, R), for some k ≥ 3, such that H (u) = H (u).
Moreover, H(0) = H (0) = H (0) = 0.
Let us define J ∈ C k (E, R) by setting
Jλ (u) =

1
1
λu2 − (Lu | u) − H(u).
2
2

(6.5)

It follows that Jλ (u) = λu − Lu − H (u). Let  be the closure of {(λ, u) ∈ R × X :
Lu + H (u) = λu, u = 0}. Then, in this case,  is the closure of the set of the critical
points u of Jλ on E such that u = 0.

6.2.1 A Krasnoselskii Theorem for Variational Operators
Theorem 6.2.1 (Krasnoselskii [60]) Suppose that (A1 ) holds and let λ∗ be an isolated eigenvalue of L with finite multiplicity. Then λ∗ is a bifurcation point of
(6.1).



Proof The proof will be divided into several steps.
∗

Step 1. Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction. Setting Z = Ker [λ I − L], E = Z ⊕ W ,
u = z + w, z ∈ Z, w ∈ W and letting P denote the orthogonal projection on W ,
parallel to Z, the equation Jλ (u) = 0 splits into the system given by the auxiliary
equation P Jλ (z+w) = 0 and the bifurcation equation (I −P )Jλ (z+w) = 0. Lemma
3.3.1 yields the existence of w = w(λ, z) defined in a neighborhood O of (λ∗ , 0) in
R×Z such that w(λ, 0) ≡ 0 and P Jλ (z+w(λ, z)) = 0. Moreover (see Remark 3.3.2),
j
w ∈ C k−1 (O, W ) and dz w(λ∗ , 0) = 0 ∀ j = 1, . . . , k − 2. In particular,
w(λ, z) ≤ z,

∀ (λ, z) ∈ O,

(6.6)

uniformly with respect to λ.
Step 2. Study of the bifurcation equation. Substituting w(λ, z) into the bifurcation
equation, we are led to find z ∈ Z such that
(I − P )Jλ (z + w(λ, z)) = 0.

(6.7)

To solve Eq. (6.7) we will take advantage of the fact that we are in the variational
case. Let us define Jλ : Z → R by setting
Jλ (z) = Jλ (z + w(λ, z)).
Lemma 6.2.2 If zλ ∈ Z is a critical point of Jλ then uλ = zλ + w(λ, zλ ) is a solution
of (6.1). Furthermore, if zλ = 0 and zλ  → 0 as |λ| → λ∗ , then uλ = 0 and
uλ  → 0.
Proof If zλ ∈ Z is a critical point of Jλ there results
(Jλ (uλ ) | ζ + dz w(λ, zλ )[ζ ]) = 0,

∀ ζ ∈ Z.

Le us remark that P Jλ (z + w(λ, z)) = 0 for all z ∈ Z. In particular, P Jλ (uλ ) = 0,
namely Jλ (uλ ) ∈ Z. Since dz w(λ, zλ )[ζ ] ∈ W we infer
(Jλ (uλ ) | dz w(λ, zλ )[ζ ]) = 0,

∀ ζ ∈ Z.

Thus (Jλ (uλ ) | ζ ) = 0, for all ζ ∈ Z. Using again the fact that P Jλ (uλ ) = 0 we
conclude that Jλ (uλ ) = 0. The second part of the lemma is deduced by using the
fact that dz w(λ, 0) = 0.


Step 3. Finding nontrivial critical points of Jλ on Z. In order to find a nontrivial
critical point of Jλ on Z, we will make, for the reader’s convenience, some additional
assumptions that will simplify the arguments. Specifically, we will suppose

66

6 Bifurcation Theory

(A2 ) there is an integer k ≥ 3 such that d j H(0) = 0, ∀j = 1, . . . , k − 1, and
d k H(0) = 0. Let
1
αk (v) = d k H(0)[v]k , v ∈ E.
k!
(A3 ) The maximum M and the minimum m of αk in the boundary of the unit ball in
Z have the same sign: either M ≥ m > 0 or m ≤ M < 0.
Let us point out that the function αk is homogeneous of degree k and hence (A3 ) is
always satisfied if k is even. Furthermore, there results
H(u) = αk (u) + o(uk )

as u → 0.

Let us evaluate Jλ (z). For brevity we write w instead of w(λ, z). One has that
(L(z + w) | z + w) = (Lz | z) + (Lw | w) = λ∗ z2 + (Lw | w)
and hence
Jλ (z) =

λ − λ∗
λ
1
z2 + w2 − (Lw | w) − H(z + w).
2
2
2

Let us remark that w satisfies P Jλ (z + w) = 0. Using the specific form of Jλ , one
has that P Jλ (u) = λP u − LP u − P H (u) and the equation P Jλ (z + w) = 0 becomes
λw − Lw = P H (z + w). This implies
λw2 − (Lw | w) = (H (z + w) | w),
and therefore
Jλ (z) =

λ − λ∗
1
z2 + (H (z + w) | w) − H(z + w).
2
2

Moreover, for some s ∈ (0, 1),
H(z + w) = H(z) + (H (z + sw) | w).
Hence we find
Jλ (z) =

λ − λ∗
1
z2 − H(z) + (H (z + w) | w) − (H (z + sw) | w).
2
2

(6.8)

We now estimate the last three terms in (6.8). Let M ≥ m > 0 (if m ≤ M < 0, we
simply consider −Jλ ) and let λ∗ < m/(1+2k ). Since H (u) = H (u) and d j H(0) = 0,

6.2 Bifurcation for Variational Operators

67

for all j ≤ k − 1, there exists ρ > 0, depending on λ, such that
H (u) ≤ λ∗ uk−1 ,
and hence
H(z) = αk (z) + β(z),

∀u < ρ,

|β(z)| ≤ λ∗ zk , ∀z < ρ.

The estimate (6.6) implies that for all r < ρ/2 there exists ε0 > 0 such that
z + w(λ, z) ≤ z + w(λ, z) ≤ 2z < 2r < ρ
and this yields
H (z + w(λ, z)) ≤ λ∗ 2k−1 zk−1 ,

∀ z < r, ∀ |λ − λ∗ | < ε0 .

This implies
|(H (z + w) | w)| ≤ H (z + w) w ≤ λ∗ 2k−1 zk ,
and
H(z) = αk (z) + β(z),

∀ z < r, ∀ |λ − λ∗ | < ε0 ,

|β(z)| ≤ λ∗ zk , ∀ z < ρ.

In conclusion, we can state the following lemma.
Lemma 6.2.3 Given λ∗ < m/(1 + 2k ) there exist r > 0 and ε0 > 0 such that
Jλ (z) =
where
R(λ, z) =

2

satisfies
|R(λ, z)| ≤ λ∗ 2k zk + λ∗ zk ,

∀ z < r, ∀ |λ − λ∗ | < ε0 .

(6.10)

Step 4. We are finally in position to prove that Jλ has a mountain pass critical point
provided |λ−λ∗ | is small. We will assume that λ−λ∗ > 0; if λ−λ∗ < 0 we consider
−Jλ and argue in the same way. First, some further preliminaries are in order.
Let z ∈ Z be such that z < r and let 0 < λ − λ∗ < ε0 . Using (6.9), the
inequality Jλ (z) > 0 implies
λ − λ∗
z2 > αk (z) − R(λ, z).
2
Then (6.10) and αk (z) ≥ mzk yield
λ − λ∗
z2 < mzk − λ∗ (1 + 2k )zk = [m − λ∗ (1 + 2k )]zk .
2
Since m > λ∗ (1 + 2k ) and k ≥ 3 it follows that there exists 0 < ε < ε0 such that

6 Bifurcation Theory

It follows that for 0 < λ − λ∗ < ε the following holds:
max Jλ (z) < 0.

z=r

This allows us to define Jλ : Z → R in such a way that
(1) Jλ (z) = Jλ (z) for all z ≤ r;
(2) Jλ ∈ C 1 (Z, R);
(3) Jλ (z) < 0 for all z ≥ r.
Since Jλ (z) = Jλ (z) for all z ≤ r, it immediately follows from (6.9) and (6.10) that
Jλ has a local strict minimum at z = 0, namely that (J 1) of Chap. 5 holds. Obviously
Jλ satisfies (J 2). Furthermore, from 3) above, it follows that any sequence zn ∈ Z,
such that Jλ (zn ) → c > 0, is bounded. Since Z is finite dimensional, it follows that
Jλ satisfies the (P S)c . Applying the mountain pass theorem to Jλ , we find zλ ∈ Z
such that Jλ (zλ ) = 0 and Jλ (zλ ) = c > 0. From the latter we infer that zλ  < r
therefore Jλ (zλ ) = Jλ (zλ ). More precisely, it follows from (6.11) that zλ  < rλ
and hence zλ  = 0 is such that zλ  → 0 as λ → λ∗ . Using Lemma 6.2.2,
Theorem 6.2.1 follows.

Remark 6.2.4 An elegant proof of Theorem 6.2.1 has been given by Marino and
Prodi [68] by using the Morse theory.

6.2.2

Branching Points

In applications it is important to know whether a branch of solutions emanates from
a bifurcation point. Precisely, we say that λ∗ is a branching point of (6.1) if the
solution set  contains a connected set S such that (λ∗ , 0) ∈ S and S \ {(λ∗ , 0)} = ∅.
For example, as we will see in Theorem 6.3.1, λ∗ is a branching point provided λ∗ is
an eigenvalue of L with finite odd multiplicity. Actually, if λ∗ is a simple eigenvalue
of L, by Theorem 6.1.2, the set S in  is, in a neighborhood of (λ∗ , 0), a curve. On
the other hand, in the general case of non-necessarily odd multiplicity, λ∗ might not
be a branching point. Bhöme [31] has given an example of a variational problem in
R2 where H ≡ 0 is C ∞ with all the derivatives at u = 0 equal to zero and λ∗ is
not a branching point. It is worth pointing out explicitly that in the Bhöme example
condition (A2 ) is not satisfied. The interested reader may see [15].
In order to prove the existence of a branching point, we will assume, in addition
to (A1 ) and (A2 ), the following condition.
(A4 ) Let ξ ∈ ∂BZ , resp. η ∈ ∂BZ , be such that αk (ξ ) = M, resp. αk (η) = m.
We assume that kM and km are not eigenvalues of the matrix D 2 αk (ξ ), resp.
D 2 αk (η).
The following theorem is proved in [6], to which we refer for more details and further
results dealing with the existence of branching points for (6.1).

6.2 Bifurcation for Variational Operators

Theorem 6.2.5 Suppose that (A1 , A2 ) and (A4 ) hold and let λ∗ be an isolated
eigenvalue of finite multiplicity of L. Then λ∗ is a branching point of (6.1).


Remark 6.2.6 (A4 ) rules out the functions αk such that αk (z) ≡ czk on Z. If this
is violated, there are examples showing that λ∗ can be a bifurcation point but not a
branching point (see [6]).
We will not give the proof of Theorem 6.2.5 here, but we will merely highlight the
role of assumption (A4 ).
Setting ε = λ − λ∗ and
ε (z) =

1
ε z2 − αk (z),
2

z ∈ Z,

the auxiliary functional Jε can be written in the form
Jε (z) = ε (z) + R(ε, z).
The functional ε has the mountain pass geometry. However, in this case it is convenient to find the mountain pass critical point in a more direct way. Since αk ≡ 0,
if T = {z ∈ Z : z = 1}, then either M := maxT αk > 0 or minT αk < 0.
Assume the former: in the other case it suffices to consider −ε instead of ε. Let
ξ ∈ T be a point where M is achieved. By homogeneity it immediately follows that
αk (ξ ) = kα(ξ )ξ = kMξ . Moreover, pε = tε ξ is a critical point of ε whenever tε
satisfies
tεk−2 =

ε
kM

(ε > 0).

(6.12)

It is easy to check that pε is the mountain pass critical point of ε we were seeking.
Next, using (A4 ) one can show that pε is a non-degenerate mountain pass critical
point of ε and there results
i(ε , pε ) = −1.

(6.13)

Roughly, let IZ denote the identity in Z and let Ak = D 2 αk . Then
D 2 ε (pε ) = εIZ − Ak (pε ).
Since pε = tε ξ and using (6.12), one finds that
D 2 ε (pε ) = εIZ − tεk−2 Ak (ξ ) = εIZ −

ε
Ak (ξ ).
kM

By (A4 ), kM is not an eigenvalue of Ak (ξ ). Hence D 2 ε (pε ) is invertible and pε is a
non-degenerate critical point of ε . As pε is a non-degenerate mountain pass critical
point, it is well known that (6.13) holds; see Remark 5.3.7-(ii). Since R satisfies

70

6 Bifurcation Theory

(6.10), the properties of the topological degree imply that for ε > 0 sufficiently
small one also has
deg (Jε , B(pε , δ), 0) = −1,

δ > 0 small,

where B(pε , δ) denote a ball in Z centered in pε with radius δ. At this point, the
properties of the degree and an appropriate limiting procedure allow us to prove that
the bifurcation set  contains a connected set S and hence λ∗ is a branching point.
It is also possible to give a more precise description of S. We set (S) = {λ ∈
R : (λ, u) ∈ S}. Under the same assumptions of Theorem 6.2.1 one can show:
(i) If k is odd then (S) contains an interval [a, b] such that a < λ∗ < b.
(ii) If k is even then (S) contains a one-sided neighborhood  of λ∗ such that
for all λ ∈  \ {λ∗ } (6.1) has at least two distinct nontrivial solutions on S.
Furthermore, if d = dim(Z) ≥ 2 and αk (z) > 0 (resp. < 0) for all z ∈ Z \ {0},
then for every λ = λ∗ + ε, with ε > 0 (resp. ε < 0) sufficiently small, (6.1)
possesses at least two pairs of distinct solutions on S.

6.3

Global Bifurcation

P. Rabinowitz [74] improved Theorem 6.1.4 by showing that, under the same hypotheses, the continuum S of  which contains (λ∗ , 0) is either unbounded or contains
another bifurcation point λ = λ∗ . By Remark 6.1.5, we explicitly state the result
under the hypothesis that there is a change of index of
λ (u) := (λ, u)
when we cross λ = λ∗ , instead of assuming that λ∗ is an eigenvalue of the linear part
of λ with odd finite multiplicity.
Theorem 6.3.1 Let λ∗ ∈ R and ε0 > 0 be such that the set (λ∗ − ε0 , λ∗ + ε0 ) \ {λ∗ }
does not contain bifurcation points of (4.9λ ). Assume also that for every λ ∈ (λ∗ −
ε0 , λ∗ ) and λ ∈ (λ∗ , λ∗ + ε0 ) the following holds:
i(λ , 0) = i(λ , 0).

(6.14)

Then the connected component, S, of  that contains (λ∗ , 0) satisfies at least one of
the following conditions:
(i) S is unbounded in R × X,
(ii) there exists a bifurcation point λ ∈ R \ {λ∗ } such that (λ , 0) ∈ S.
Proof By Theorem 6.1.4 (see also Remark 6.1.5), λ∗ is a bifurcation point from
zero of λ (u) = 0. Let S be the connected component of  which contains (λ∗ , 0).

6.3 Global Bifurcation

71

We argue by contradiction and assume that S verifies neither (i) nor (ii). This means
that S is bounded and that for every λ = λ∗ there exists ρ(λ) > 0 such that
Sλ ∩ Bρ(λ) (0) = ∅.
We claim that there exists a bounded set O ⊂ R × X and ε0 > 0 satisfying
∂O ∩  = ∅,

(6.15)

(λ∗ , 0) ∈ O

(6.16)

O ∩ (R × {0}) ⊂ (λ∗ − ε0 , λ∗ + ε0 ) × X.

(6.17)

and

Indeed, if Uδ denotes the neighborhood of S consisting in all points with distance
to S less than δ, then in the case  ∩ ∂Uδ = ∅ it suffices to take O = Uδ . In the
other case, since the set M = U δ ∩  is a compact metric space, we can apply
Lemma 4.3.1 to the closed sets S and  ∩ ∂Uδ to conclude the existence of two
compact, disjoint subsets A, B of M, with
M = A ∪ B, S ⊂ A.
By taking as O a neighborhood of A of all points with distance to A less than the
distance between A and B, we obtain (6.15)–(6.16).
The general homotopy property allows to deduce then that
deg (λ , Oλ , 0) = const.,

∀λ ∈ R.

(6.18)

Now, we are going to compute this degree. To do it, fix λ ∈ (λ∗ , λ∗ + ε0 ) such that
(λ, 0) ∈ O. We can choose ρ > 0 such that:
(a) For every λ ∈ [λ, λ∗ + ε0 ], the problem (4.9)λ has no nontrivial solutions in
Bρ (0), i.e.,
λ ∩ Bρ (0) = ∅.
(b) For every λ ≥ λ∗ + ε0 , the λ-slice Oλ of O does not contain points of the closed
ball Bρ (0), i.e.,
Oλ ∩ Bρ (0) = ∅.
Take
U = O ∩ [λ, +∞) × (X \ Bρ (0)) .
Observe that the λ-slice Uλ of U is given by
Uλ = Oλ \ Bρ (0),
for every λ ≥ λ.

72

6 Bifurcation Theory

By (a) and (b), the general homotopy property of the degree implies that
deg (λ , Uλ , 0) = constant,

∀λ ≥ λ.

But, since O is bounded, Uλ = Oλ \Bρ (0) = Oλ = ∅ provided that λ ! λ. We obtain
as a consequence that the above degree is zero. In particular, deg (λ , Uλ , 0) = 0,
that is,
deg (λ , Oλ \ Bρ (0), 0) = 0.
By the additivity property we conclude that
deg (λ , Oλ , 0) = deg (λ , Oλ \ Bρ (0), 0) + deg (λ , Bρ (0), 0)
= i (λ , 0).
Similarly, if we fix λ ∈ (λ∗ − ε0 , λ∗ ) such that (λ, 0) ∈ O, we can prove that
deg (λ , Oλ , 0) = i (λ , 0).
Consequently, taking into account (6.18) we conclude that
i(λ , 0) = i(λ , 0),
which contradicts (6.14).



Now, as a direct consequence of the above theorem, we have the classical improvement by Rabinowitz of the theorem of Krasnoselskii.
Corollary 6.3.2 Under the hypotheses of Theorem 6.1.4, there exists a continuum
S of  that either is unbounded, or (λ , 0) ∈ S for another eigenvalue λ = λ∗
of L.

Elliptic Problems and Functional Analysis

The purpose of this chapter is to show how a nonlinear elliptic problem can be
transformed into an operator equation that can be treated with the abstract tools
discussed in the previous chapters.

7.1

Nonlinear Elliptic Problems

The abstract results proved in the preceding chapters will be applied to elliptic
problems such as

−u = λf (x, u), in 
(7.1)
u = 0,
on ∂,
where  ⊂ RN is a bounded domain with smooth boundary ∂, f :  × R → R
and λ ∈ R. In the sequel we will assume that f is sufficiently smooth. This will
simplify the exposition, though in many cases weaker regularity assumptions could
be made.
It turns out that weak solutions are classical solutions provided f (x, u) is Hölder
continuous and for some p ∈ [1, +∞) it satisfies the growth condition
|f (x, u)| ≤ c1 + c2 |u|p ,

p < 2∗ − 1,

To prove this fact one uses what is called bootstrap argument. It is based on the
following property: if a weak solution u ∈ H01 () of (7.1) belongs to Lr () for
some r > 1, then, by (7.2), f (x, u(x)) ∈ Lr/p () and the Agmon–Douglis–Nirenberg

estimates (Theorem 1.2.11-1) imply that u ∈ W 2, p (). By the Sobolev embedding
2∗

(see Theorem 1.1.3-1, we can begin by taking r0 = 2∗ to deduce that u ∈ W 2, p ().
Using again Theorem 1.1.3-1 we have three possible cases:
N 2∗

1. u ∈ L pN −2 2∗ () (if Np < 2∗ 2).
2. u ∈ Lt () for every t > 2 (if Np = 2∗ 2), and applying again Theorem 1.2.111, we derive that u ∈ W 2,t (). In this case, choosing t > N/2, we infer (by
Theorem 1.1.3-1) that u ∈ C α () for some α ∈ (0, 1).
3. u ∈ C α () for some α ∈ (0, 1) (provided Np > 2∗ 2).
∗

Observe that in the first case pNN2
> r0 and we can iterate the process by taking
−2 2∗
∗

N2
now r1 = pN−2
. It is easy to prove that in a finite number of iterations we get
2∗
rk

u ∈ W 2, p () with rpk > N2 . Thus, also in this case we have u ∈ C α () for some
α ∈ (0, 1). Finally, since f is Hölder, f (x, u(x)) is also Hölder and, by the Schauder
estimates (Theorem 1.2.11-2), we conclude that u ∈ C 2 ().
Problem (7.1) can be transformed into an operator equation in several ways,
depending on the abstract tools we are going to use.

7.1.1

Classical Formulation

If we are working with the classical formulation of the problem, then, for example,
we can let X = {u ∈ C 2 () : u(x) = 0, ∀ x ∈ ∂}, Y = C() and Tλ (u) =
u + λf (x, u). Then any solution u ∈ X of the equation Tλ (u) = 0 is a solution of
(7.1). This framework is well suited for the use of the local inversion theorem or the
implicit function theorem.
In order to use topological degree theoretic arguments, we could take for instance
either X = {u ∈ C 0,ν () : u(x) = 0, ∀x ∈ ∂}, 0 ≤ ν < 1, or X = C01 () and
consider the operator K introduced in Sect. 1.2.5, i.e., w = Ku is the unique solution
of −w = u in  satisfying w|∂ = 0. Let us point out that the Nemitski operator
f , i.e., the operator which maps every function u ∈ X into the function f ◦ u, is
continuous on X. Setting T (u) = Kf (u) and λ (u) = u − λT (u), the solutions of
λ (u) = 0 correspond to solutions of (7.1). Moreover, for any u ∈ X one has that
w = Ku ∈ C 2,ν (), and Ascoli’s theorem implies that K maps bounded sets in
relatively compact sets in X. As a consequence, the nonlinear operator T : X −→ X
is compact. Hence  is a compact perturbation of the identity and we can employ
the Schauder fixed point theorem or else the homotopy invariance of the degree. The
reader has to observe that the application of these tools requires us to prove a priori
bounds. By this one means that there exists M > 0 such that u ≤ M for any
possible solution of (7.1).

7.1.2 Weak Formulation
On the other hand, if we are working with the weak formulation of the problem
(7.5) and we want to employ critical point theory, it is convenient to work on a

7.1 Nonlinear Elliptic Problems

75

Hilbert space. Usually, one chooses the Sobolev space E = H01 () endowed with
the scalar product and norm
1/2




(u | v) =

∇u · ∇v ,

u =

|∇u|2

.

u
Let F (x, u) = 0 f (x, s)ds with f satisfying (7.2) and define the functional Jλ :
E → R by setting

Jλ (u) = 21 u2 − λ

F (x, u(x)) .

Observe that F (x, u(x)) is integrable by (7.2). In addition,



dJλ (u)[v] = (u | v) − λ f (x, u)v = ∇u · ∇v − λ f (x, u)v.
Then any critical point u ∈ E of Jλ verifies


∇u · ∇v − λ f (x, u)v = 0,

∀ v ∈ E,

and hence is a weak solution of (7.1). Since f is smooth, by elliptic regularity, u
is a classical solution. It is instructive to evaluate the gradient Jλ (u). By definition,
Jλ (u) ∈ E is such that dJλ (u)[v] = (Jλ (u) | v), for all v ∈ E, namely



∇u · ∇v − λ f (x, u)v = ∇z · ∇v , ∀ v ∈ E,
where z = Jλ (u). Setting w = u − z, then w is such that


∇w · ∇v = λ f (x, u)v , ∀ v ∈ E.
Therefore w is a solution of −w = λf (x, u), with w|∂ = 0. In other words,
w = λK ◦ f (u) where K denotes the inverse of the operator − on H01 (). In
conclusion we have found that
Jλ (u) = u − λK ◦ f (u).
Lemma 7.1.1 The functional Jλ satisfies the compactness part (b) the (PS) condition
(see Section 5.3).
Proof Indeed, let {un } be a bounded sequence in H01 () such that Jλ (un ) is bounded
and Jλ  (un ) −→ 0. Taking un −u as a test function, we obtain Jλ  (un )(un −u) −→ 0,
i.e.,
(un | un − u) − λ(K(f (un )) | un − u) −→ 0.
By (7.2) and the compactness of K, we infer that K(f (un )) strongly converges to
K(f (u)) up to a subsequence. Then (K(f (un )) | un − u) converges to zero and hence
(un | un − u) tends to zero. This immediately implies that un is strongly convergent.

7 Elliptic Problems and Functional Analysis

In some cases one can look for pairs (λ, u) in R×E satisfying (7.1) with prescribed
norm of u, i.e., such that u = R, for some fixed R > 0. We will refer to this problem
as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. The difference with respect to the boundary value
problem (7.1) is that here λ is not a given number, but is unknown and appears as
a Lagrange multiplier. In order to find solutions of such an eigenvalue problem,
it is natural
 to use variational methods, in particular, Theorem 5.4.4 minimizing
F(u) = F (x, u(x))dx on the sphere u = R. According to Example 5.2.2, a local
minimum of such an F on the sphere satisfies F  (u) = λu for a suitable Lagrange
multiplier λ ∈ R. As we have seen before, u is a solution of (7.1) such that u = R.
On the other hand, if we want to apply bifurcation theory to study the existence
of weak solutions of the boundary value problem


−u = λu + f (x, u),
u = 0,

in 
on ∂,

(7.4)

we set E = L2 () and let K be the inverse of the Laplacian operator (see Sect. 1.2.5),
so that (7.4) is equivalent to u = λKu+Kf (u), u ∈ E. Setting L = K and H = Kf ,
we get H (0) = 0 and H  (0) = 0 provided f (x, 0) = 0 and ∂f
(x, 0) = 0. Hence, we
∂u
are in the abstract setting discussed in Chap. 6 dealing with bifurcation theory.
In this case the possible bifurcation points are the characteristic values λ of K,
i.e., the λ such that Ker (λK − I ) = {0} or, equivalently, the eigenvalues of − (see
Lemma 6.1.1).
Let us remark that from elliptic regularity and the Rellich theorem (see Sect. 1.2.5)
it follows that K is a compact operator.
Remark 7.1.2 It is worth pointing out that one can use other ways to frame the
boundary value problems (7.4) or (7.1). For example, we can find bifurcation results
by means of degree theory (or of analytical tools) by working in the Banach space
X considered in Sect. 7.1.1.

7.2

Sub- and Super-Solutions and Increasing Operators

A separate discussion is in order when we want to use the topics studied in Sect. 2.2
dealing with increasing operators.
In this case, by definiteness we fix λ = 1 in (7.1), i.e., let us consider the Dirichlet
boundary value problem


−u = f (x, u),
u = 0,

in 
on ∂,

(7.5)

where f ∈ C 0,ν ( × R), 0 < ν < 1, and there exists m > 0 such that
(f 0) For every fixed x ∈ , the function fm (x, u) := f (x, u) + mu is increasing
with respect to u.

7.2 Sub- and Super-Solutions and Increasing Operators

77

Problem (7.5) is equivalent to


−u + mu = fm (x, u),
u = 0,

in 
on ∂.

(7.6)

According to the previous arguments, (7.6) can be translated into the operator equation u = T (u), with u ∈ X = C 0,ν (), 0 ≤ ν < 1, and T = Km ◦ fm , where
Km u = z iff −z + mz = u, z|∂ = 0. Let us remark that T is compact since Km
is. In the space X we consider the natural ordering: v ≤ w iff v(x) ≤ w(x) for all
x ∈ .
We claim that T is an increasing operator. Let u ≤ v; then z = T (u) = Km (fm (u))
(respectively, w = T (v) = Km (fm (v)) is a solution of the equation −z + mz =
fm (x, u) (resp. −w + mw = fm (x, v)), satisfying z|∂ = w|∂ = 0. By (f 0),
u ≤ v implies that fm (x, u) ≤ fm (x, v) and hence, by the maximum principle (see
Theorem 1.3.14), it follows that z ≤ w in , proving the claim.
A function v ∈ C 2 () ∩ C() such that


−v ≤ f (x, v),
v ≤ 0,

in 
on ∂,

is called a sub-solution of (7.5). Similarly, a super-solution w ∈ C 2 () ∩ C() is
defined by requiring

−w ≥ f (x, w), in 
w ≥ 0,
on ∂.
Thus a sub-solution, resp. super-solution, is a v ∈ X, resp. w ∈ X, such that v ≤ T (v),
resp. w ≥ T (w).
After these preliminaries, a straight application of Theorem 2.2.2 yields the
following.
Theorem 7.2.1 Let f ∈ C 0,ν ( × R), 0 < ν < 1 satisfy (f 0) and suppose that v,
resp. w, is a sub-solution, resp. super-solution, of (7.5) such that v ≤ w. Then (7.5)
has a solution u such that v ≤ u ≤ w. Moreover, (7.5) has a minimal solution u1
and a maximal solution u2 , in the sense that any other solution u of (7.5), such that
v ≤ u ≤ w, satisfies u1 ≤ u ≤ u2 .
Remark 7.2.2 The proof of the previous theorem is also obtained by imposing only
a more general hypothesis than (f 0). Indeed, it instead suffices to assume that the
following condition holds:
(f)0) For every fixed x ∈ , the function fm (x, u) := f (x, u) + mu is increasing
with respect to u ∈ [min v, max w].
Notice that every locally Lipschitzian function f satisfies the hypothesis (f)0).
As a trivial application of Theorem 7.2.1 let us show that (7.5) possesses a solution
provided f ∈ C 0,ν ( × R), 0 < ν < 1 and there exist a < b such that f (x, a) ≥

78

7 Elliptic Problems and Functional Analysis

0 ≥ f (x, b) for all x ∈ . It suffices to remark that v ≡ a is a sub-solution, and
w ≡ b is a super-solution of (7.5), because
0 = −v ≤ f (x, a),

0 = −w ≥ f (x, b).

Moreover v < w and Theorem 7.2.1 yields a solution u of (7.5).
It will be useful to know different proofs of Theorem 7.2.1. Using topological or
variational methods we will find additional information about the solution. This will
provide the existence of multiple solutions. We begin by computing the degree of
the operator I − T .
Lemma 7.2.3 In addition to the hypotheses of Theorem 7.2.1, assume that f ∈
C 1 ( × R) and that v, w ∈ C01 () ∩ C 2 () are not solutions, v < w in  and
∂w
∂v

where BR (0) denotes the ball centered at zero and with radius R in the space C01 ()
of the functions of class C 1 which vanish on ∂. Then there is R > 0 such that
deg (I − T , U (R), 0) = 1.
Proof Observe that the set U (R) is open, bounded and convex in C01 (). We consider
the truncated problem

−u + mu = fm (x, u),
u = 0,

on ∂,

if w(x) < s.

Following the notation used in Theorem 7.2.1, we set T = Km ◦ fm , which is a
compact operator (by the compactness of Km ). In addition, the boundedness of fm
and the Lp -estimates imply that T (C01 ()) is bounded in C01 (). Let R be a positive
number such that T (C01 ()) ⊂ B(R). Using the strong comparison principle and the
Hopf lemma (see [58, Lemma 3.4]) for the operator − + mI it is easily seen that

on ∂ for every u ∈ C01 (). In other
v < T(u) < w in  and ∂w

words, we have seen that T(C01 ()) ⊂ U (R). Fixing z ∈ U (R), let us consider the

homotopy

79

H (λ, u) = λT(u) + (1 − λ)z.

The convexity of U (R) implies that λT(u) + (1 − λ)z ∈ U (R) for every λ ∈ [0, 1]
and u ∈ C01 (). Hence,
u = H (λ, u),

∀u ∈ ∂U (R),

∀λ ∈ [0, 1]

and deg (H (λ, ·), U (R), 0) is well defined. The invariance by homotopy gives
deg (I − T, U (R), 0) = deg (H (1, ·), U (R), 0) = deg (H (0, ·), U (R), 0) = 1
since H (0, ·) is a constant map.

Now, we show that in general the solution obtained between sub- and supersolution is a local minimum of the corresponding Euler functional:

J (u) =
|∇u|2 − F (x, u), u ∈ H01 (),
2
s
where, as usual, F (x, s) = 0 f (x, t)dt. In order to do his, we have to prove the
following result due to Brezis and Nirenberg [38].
Theorem 7.2.4 Assume that
|f (x, u)| ≤ c1 + c2 |u|p , a.e. x ∈ ,

∀u ∈ R

with p < 2∗ − 1. If, for some r > 0, u0 ∈ H01 () satisfies
J (u0 ) ≤ J (u0 + v),

∀v ∈ C01 () with vC 1 ≤ r,

(7.7)

then there exists ε > 0 such that
J (u0 ) ≤ J (u0 + v),

∀v ∈ H01 () with v ≤ ε.

Remark 7.2.5 1. In other words, if u0 ∈ H01 () is a local minimizer of J in the
C 1 -topology, then u0 is also a local minimizer of J in the H01 -topology.
2. As can be seen in the original paper by Brezis and Nirenberg, the theorem is also
true for p = 2∗ − 1.
Proof By Lp -theory it is possible to show that u0 ∈ C 1 () and thus we may assume
without loss of generality that u0 = 0. We argue by contradiction assuming that for
every ε > 0 there exists vε ∈ H01 () such that vε  ≤ ε and
J (vε ) = min J (v) < J (0).
v≤ε

(Observe that the existence of minimizer vε is a consequence of the weak lower
semicontinuity of J ). By the Lagrange multiplier theorem, there exists a Lagrange

Since p < 2∗ − 1, the Agmong–Douglis–Nirenberg regularity result implies that the
norm vε C 1 may be estimated by the norm vε  which is smaller than or equal to
ε. Therefore, vε C 1 converges to zero as ε goes to zero and we may choose ε such
that vε C 1 ≤ r and then, by (7.7), J (0) ≤ J (vε ), contradicting the definition of vε .

Lemma 7.2.6 If, in addition to the assumptions of Theorem 7.2.1, v and w are not
solutions of (7.5), then there is solution u of (7.5) with v < u < w in  and which
is a local minimizer of J in H01 ().
Proof For the convenience of the reader, here we prove the lemma in the case that
v, w ∈ C01 (), which allows us to use the Hopf lemma (see [58, Lemma 3.4]). We
refer to [38] for the general case (even if v and w are only continuous (not C 2 ) suband super- solutions in the sense of distributions). We consider now the truncated

−(v − u0 ) ≤ 0 in A and v − u0 ≤ 0 on ∂A. By the maximum principle we deduce
that v ≤ u0 in A, contradicting the definition of A and proving that A = ∅, i.e.,
v ≤ u0 .
Using again (7.8) and hypothesis (f 0) we also obtain −(v − u0 ) + k(v − u0 ) ≤
[f (x, v) + k(v − u0 )] − [f(x, u0 ) + k(v − u0 )] ≤ 0. Taking into account that v is not
a solution, v − u0 ≡ 0, the strong maximum principle and Hopf lemma show that
u0 − v belongs to the interior of the cone of positive functions in C01 ().

7.2 Sub- and Super-Solutions and Increasing Operators

A similar argument using the super-solution w (instead of v) implies that w − u0
is also in the interior of this cone. Therefore, u0 is in the interior of the set {u ∈
C01 () : v ≤ u ≤ w in }, i.e., there exists ε > 0 such that

u ∈ C01 ()
$⇒ v ≤ u ≤ w in .

To conclude the proof, it suffices to observe that J (u) − J(u) is constant in the
(x, u) − F (x, u) depends only on x for u ∈ [v(x), w(x)])
ball u − u0 C 1 ≤ ε (since F
and to use that u0 is a global minimizer of J. This implies that u0 is a local minimizer
of J in the C 1 -topology and, by Theorem 7.2.4, in the H01 ()-topology.

The following example shows that, in general, the existence of a sub-solution v and
a super-solution w, without assuming that they are ordered v ≤ w, does not imply
the existence of a solution. Indeed, let λ1 < λ2 denote the first two eigenvalues of
the linear Dirichlet problem

−u = λu, in 
u = 0,
on ∂,
and let ϕ1 > 0, and ϕ2 ≡ 0 denote two eigenfunctions corresponding to λ1 , λ2 , resp.
Fixing 0 < α < β, choose
a smooth function h such that (i) α(λ2 − λ1 )ϕ1 < h <

β(λ2 − λ1 )ϕ1 and (ii) hϕ2 = 0. Using ϕ2 as a test function, the latter condition
implies that the problem

−u = λ2 u − h(x), in 
(7.9)
u = 0,
on ∂
has no solution. On the other hand,
v = βϕ1 ,

w = αϕ1 ,

are, respectively, a sub-solution and a super-solution of (7.9). Actually, v(x) =
w(x) = 0 for x ∈ ∂ and, using (i), we find that
−v = βλ1 ϕ1 < λ2 βϕ1 − h = λ2 v − h,
as well as
−w = αλ1 ϕ1 < λ2 αϕ1 − h = λ2 w − h.
Despite the above example, we see now a result in which the existence of a suband a super-solution is sufficient to find a solution of a boundary value problem.
Specifically, we follow [3] to prove the following theorem.
Theorem 7.2.7 Let g be a bounded continuous function. If there exist a sub-solution
v and a super-solution w of the problem

−u = λ1 u + g(u), in 
u = 0,
on ∂,
then there exists a solution of it.

7 Elliptic Problems and Functional Analysis

Proof Consider X = C() and take a positive eigenfunction ϕ associated to the
first eigenvalue λ1 . Then Ker ( −  − λ1 I ) = Rϕ. We split the space X = Rϕ ⊕ W ,
i.e. u = tϕ + w, where t ∈ R and w ∈ W . By the Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction we
see that our problem is equivalent to the system
w = AQg(tϕ + w)
g(tϕ + w)ϕ = 0,
where A is the inverse of the operator −−λ1 I in W (since zero is not an eigenvalue
of it).
We study now the solution set  = {(t, w) ∈ R × W : w = AQb(tϕ + w)} of the
first equation in the system. By the boundedness of g, there exists R > 0 such that
AQg(tϕ + w) < r,

∀t ∈ R,

∀w ∈ W

and hence  ⊂ R × Br , where Br denotes the open ball in W of radius r and
centered at zero. This implies also that λ (w) = w − λAQg(tϕ + w), for λ ∈ [0, 1]
and w ∈ W , defines a homotopy and thus
deg (λ , Br , 0) = deg (0 , Br , 0) = 1.
Given α > 0, by using Theorem 4.3.4 we obtain the existence of a connected set
α ⊂  such that α crosses {−α}×W as well as {α}×W . Taking into account that
α is connected and the continuity on R × W of the function γ (t, w) = g(tϕ + w)ϕ
we deduce that γ (α ) is an interval. Three cases may occur: 0 ∈ γ (α ), γ (α ) ⊂
(0, +∞) or γ (α ) ⊂ ( − ∞, 0).
In the first case, we have already solved the system and so our problem.
With respect to the second case, i.e., γ (α ) ⊂ (0, +∞), we deduce that for every
pair (t, z) ∈ R × Z the function u = tϕ + w satisfies
−u = −tϕ − w = λ1 tϕ + λ1 w + g(tϕ + w) − γ (t, w)ϕ < λ1 u + g(u), in ,
namely, it is a sub-solution of our problem. Clearly it is possible to take a very
negative number t in order to have u be smaller than or equal to the super-solution
w given by hypothesis. Consequently, Theorem 7.2.1 applies and we also obtain a
solution of our problem in this case.
The proof in the third case is similar: it suffices to observe now that u = tϕ + w
is a super-solution.

Problems with A Priori Bounds

In this chapter we discuss problems in which one can obtain a priori bounds for the
solutions. Roughly, this happens if the nonlinearity is sublinear at infinity. It will be
shown that, according to the properties of the nonlinearity, we can use the global
inversion theorem (to get existence and uniqueness) or topological degree or else
critical point theory.

8.1 An Elementary Nonexistence Result
Consider the Dirichlet boundary value problem


−u = f (u) + h(x),
u = 0,

in ,
on ∂.

(8.1)

In this case, the existence of a priori bounds for (8.1) is strongly related to the fact that
the limits at infinity of f (u)/u do not intersect the spectrum of the Laplace operator,
in a sense made precise in the sequel.
To put more in evidence the necessity of interaction with spectrum, observe that
if (8.1) has one solution, using a positive eigenfunction ϕ1 associated to the first
eigenvalue λ1 of the Laplace operator as a test function, we conclude that

[f (u) + h(x) − λ1 u] ϕ1 = 0.
Consequently we deduce the following trivial nonexistence result.
Proposition 8.1.1 Assume that  is an open subset in RN , f is continuous and
h ∈ L2 (). If either
• f (u) + h(x) < λ1 u for every u ∈ R and a.e. x ∈ , or
• f (u) + h(x) > λ1 u for every u ∈ R and a.e. x ∈ ,
then problem (8.1) has no weak solution.

We denote by  the closed interval of extrema γ− and γ+ .
For fixed 0 < ν < 1, let X = {u ∈ C 2,ν () : u(x) = 0 on ∂}, Y = C 0,ν () and
F (u) = −u − f (u). For any h ∈ Y , the classical solutions of (8.1) are u ∈ X such
that F (u) = h.
Proposition 8.2.1 Suppose that (8.2) holds and that the interval  does not contain
any eigenvalue λk . Let un ∈ X and set hn = F (un ). Then un is bounded in X provided
that hn ∈ Y is.
Proof We start by proving that un Y is bounded. Otherwise, up to a subsequence,
we can assume that un Y converges to infinity. Setting zn = un un −1
Y and using
(8.2) to write

Then λk [a] = 1 for some integer k ≥ 1. We assume now that γ+ ≤ γ− (the
verification for the reversed case γ− ≤ γ+ is left to the reader). Observe that if z
does not change sign then either −z = γ+ z+ or −z = γ− z− . Both cases are not
possible because  = [γ+ , γ− ] does not contain any eigenvalue λk . Hence u changes
sign and the following holds:
|{x ∈  : a(x) > γ+ }| > 0 and |{x ∈  : a(x) < γ− }| > 0.
Using the comparison property of eigenvalues (see Proposition 1.3.11-i)), we obtain

a contradiction because  = [γ+ , γ− ] does not contain any eigenvalue λk . Therefore,

also bounded.

8.3

Existence of Solutions

In this section we will see how the different abstract techniques developed in the
previous chapters can be used in conjunction with the a priori bounds of the previous
section to prove existence of solutions of the problem (8.1). We will keep the notation
introduced before.

8.3.1

Using the Global Inversion Theorem

Our first result deals with a case in which the global inversion Theorem 3.4.5 applies.
We start by proving the following lemma.
Lemma 8.3.1 Suppose that f ∈ C 1 (R, R) satisfies (8.2). If the interval  does not
contain any eigenvalue λk , then F is proper.
Proof Let hn ∈ Y , hn → h ∈ Y and let un ∈ X be such that F (un ) = hn , namely

−un = f (un ) + hn (x), in ,
un = 0,
on ∂.
By Proposition 8.2.1, un is bounded in X. In particular, f (un ) + hn is also bounded
in Y . By the compactness of K : Y −→ Y we deduce that, up to a subsequence,
un converges in Y to some u ∈ X satisfying −u = f (u) + h(x), in . Finally,

86

8 Problems with A Priori Bounds

using that −(un − u) = f (un ) − f (u) + hn (x) − h(x) and Schauder estimates (see
Theorem 1.2.11), we readily conclude that un converges in X to u.


Theorem 8.3.2 Let f ∈ C 1 (R, R) be such that
1. condition (8.2) is satisfied and the interval  does not contain any eigenvalue λk ;
2. for all u ∈ R, either f  (u) < λ1 , or λk < f  (u) < λk+1 for some k ≥ 1.
Then (8.1) has a unique solution for all h ∈ Y .
Proof Let us show that F has no singular points. One has
dF (u)[v] = v + f  (u)v.
Using assumption 2 and the comparison property of the eigenvalues, it readily follows
that Ker dF (u) = {0} and this implies that the singular set is empty. By hypothesis
1 (see Lemma 8.3.1), F is proper and the global inversion theorem applies, proving
the result.



8.3.2

Using Degree Theory

We apply the Schauder fixed point Theorem 4.2.6 to prove the existence part of
Theorem 8.3.2.
Theorem 8.3.3 Suppose that f ∈ C(R, R) satisfies (8.2) and the interval  does
not contain any eigenvalue λk . Then (8.1) has at least one solution.
Proof We will carry out the proof in the case λk < γ− , γ+ < λk+1 . If γ− , γ+ < λ1
the arguments require trivial changes. We let γ = λk +λ2 k+1 and denote by Kγ :
L2 () −→ L2 () the inverse of the operator − − γ I (which is well defined
because γ is not an eigenvalue of the Laplacian operator). We write (8.1) as
u = Kγ [N(u)],

u ∈ L2 (),

where N : L2 () −→ L2 () is defined by
N u(x) = f (u(x)) + h(x) − γ u(x),

∀x ∈ .

Hence, we just have to prove the existence of a fixed point of T = Kγ ◦ N . This
is done by using the Schauder fixed point theorem. In order to do this, observe that
from the hypotheses on f , the continuous function g defined in  × R by
g(x, s) = f (x, s) − γ+ s + − γ− s − ,

∀s ∈ R

(with s + = max{s, 0} and s − = min{s, 0}) satisfies lim|s|→+∞ g(x, s)/s = 0 (i.e., it
is sublinear). Hence, there exists μ ∈ (0, (λk+1 − λk )/2) such that
|f (x, s) − γ s| ≤ μ|s|,

∀s ∈ R

deduce that T uL2 ≤ r, provided uL2 ≤ r, i.e., T (B(0, r)) ⊂ B(0, r). Finally the
compactness of Kγ and the continuity of the Nemitski operator N (see Theorem 1.2.1)
imply the compactness of T , and we can so use the Schauder Theorem 4.2.6 to
conclude the proof.


Remark 8.3.4 From the proof of Schauder Theorem 4.2.6 by using the degree, we
deduce that there exists r > 0 such that deg (T , B(0, r), 0) = 1.
Remark 8.3.5 If, in addition, item 2 of Theorem 8.3.2 is satisfied, then it is possible
to prove the uniqueness of the solution as well. Indeed, the meaning of this condition
is that the operator T is a contraction and thus the Banach contraction principle can
be applied to obtain (existence and) uniqueness.

8.3.3

Using Critical Point Theory

According to the discussion of Sect. 7.1.2, solutions of (8.1) could also be found by
looking for critical points of the Euler functional



2
1
J (u) = 2 |∇u| − F (u) − h(x)u, u ∈ E = H01 (),
where F (u) =

u

0 f (s)ds. Let us remark that for every ε > 0 there exists Cε > 0

|F (u)| ≤ Cε + 21 (max{γ− , γ+ } + ε) |u|2 .

(8.6)

In particular, F (u) ∈ L1 () for all u ∈ E and J ∈ C 1 (E, R). Moreover, setting

F(u) = F (u),
one has the following.

88

8 Problems with A Priori Bounds

Lemma 8.3.6 F is weakly continuous.
Proof Let un  u weakly in E. By the Rellich–Kondrachov TheoremA.4.9, un → u
strongly in L2 , up to a subsequence. From (8.6) and the dominated convergence


theorem, we deduce that F(un ) → F(u).
In order to prove Theorem 8.3.3 by applying the results on critical point theory to
the functional J , we state the following lemma on the Palais–Smale condition.
Lemma 8.3.7 If  does not contain any eigenvalue λk , then J satisfies the Palais–
Smale condition.
Remark 8.3.8 The reader should observe the similarity between the proof of this
lemma and the corresponding proof of Proposition 8.2.1.
Proof Let {un } ⊂ H01 () be a sequence such that {J (un )} is bounded and {J  (un )}
tends to zero in H01 (). To prove that {un } has a convergent subsequence, it suffices
to show that it is bounded in H01 () (see Lemma 7.1.1). Assume, by contradiction,
that un  → +∞. Using that
J  (un )(ϕ)

n→+∞

for every ϕ ∈ H01 (). Passing to a subsequence if necessary, we may assume without
loss of generality that zn  z in H01 (), zn → z in L2 (), zn (x) → z(x) a.e. x ∈ .
Thus, by the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem we yield



un 

and hence


∇z · ∇ϕ =

γ+ z+ + γ− z− ϕ,

i.e., v is a solution of the problem (8.4). This implies that z = 0 and this is a
contradiction because we deduce that


f (x, un )zn − hzn = 1.
0 = lim (J  (un ) | zn ) = 1 − lim
n→+∞

n→+∞

Therefore, {un } is bounded and the Palais–Smale condition has been verified.



Variational proof of Theorem 8.3.3 By Lemma 8.3.7, it suffices to study the geometry
of J . It is convenient to consider three cases:
Case 1. max{γ− , γ+ } < λ1
Case 2. λ1 < γ− , γ+ < λ2
Case 3. λk < γ− , γ+ < λk + 1, with k ≥ 2.

8.3 Existence of Solutions

89

Case 1 We begin proving that if max{γ− , γ+ } < λ1 , then J has a minimum on E
which gives rise to a solution (8.9). Indeed, if we fix γ ∈ (max{γ− , γ+ }, λ1 ), from
(8.6) one has

J (u) ≥ 21 u2 − c1 − 21 γ |u|2 − h2 uL2 .
Using the Poincaré inequality (Corollary 1.3.9) we deduce


γ
J (u) ≥ 21 1 −
u2 − c1 − c2 u.
λ1
Since γ < λ1 , it follows that J is coercive and then, by Theorem 5.4.1-2, J has a
minimum on E. (It is also possible to show that J is w.l.s.c. and therefore to apply
Corollary 1.2.5 instead of Theorem 5.4.1-2, to prove the existence of a minimum of
J on E.)
Case 2 We prove that if λ1 < γ− , γ+ < λ2 the functional J has a mountain pass
critical point. Indeed, choosing λ1 < μ < γ− , γ+ < μ < λ2 , it is easy to verify that
1 2

μu − C1 ≤ F (u) ≤ μu2 + C2 ,

From (8.7) it follows that
lim J (tϕ1 ) = −∞.

|t|→+∞

From (8.8) it follows that
inf J > −∞.

ϕ1 ⊥

Moreover, the Palais–Smale condition holds (see Lemma 8.3.7). Then we can use
the variant of the mountain pass theorem given in Theorem 5.3.8 to infer that J has
a critical point.
Case 3 We show that if λk < γ− , γ+ < λk+1 , with k ≥ 2, then the saddle point
theorem applies.
Indeed, choosing λk < μ < γ− , γ+ < μ < λk+1 , and repeating the arguments
carried out in case 2, it is easy to verify that J satisfies (8.7) and (8.8).

8.4

Positive Solutions

Here we will be interested in applying Theorem 8.3.3 to find positive solutions of

−u = f (x, u), in ,
(8.9)
u = 0,
on ∂,
under the assumption that f (x, 0) ≥ 0. In such a case we will define f for u < 0 by
setting
f (x, u) ≡ f (x, 0),

∀ u ≤ 0.

(8.10)

Since the modified f satisfies f (x, u) ≥ 0 for every u ≤ 0, then by the maximum
principle, any solution of (8.9), with the modified f , is greater than or equal to zero
so that the value of f for u ≤ 0 does not play any role. In the sequel we will always
understand that f denotes the given nonlinearity extended to negative u by (8.10).
If γ+ := lims→+∞ f (x, s)/s < λ1 , then Theorem 8.3.3 gives us the existence of
a (non-negative) solution of (8.9) obtained as a global minimum of the associated
Euler functional. In order to prove that this is not zero we need some additional
hypotheses on the behavior of f at zero. Notice that the role played by −∞ in the
study of the existence of solutions in the previous sections will be now replaced
by u = 0. In this way, the following result is the counterpart of Theorem 8.3.3 for
positive solutions in the case max{γ− , γ+ } < λ1 .
Theorem 8.4.1 Assume that γ+ < λ1 and let us suppose that
γ0 := lim+

f (u) ≥ (γ0 − ε)u provided 0 < u < δ. Then F (x, u) ≥ 21 (γ0 − ε)|u|2 for 0 < u < δ
and if t < δϕ1 −1



J (tϕ1 ) = 21 t 2 − F (x, tϕ1 )dx ≤ 21 t 2 − 21 t 2 (γ0 − ε) ϕ12 dx.

J (z) = minE J < 0, proving that z = 0.
Next we give a new proof of the preceding theorem by using sub- and super-solutions.
As usual, ϕ1 > 0 denotes a positive eigenfunction corresponding to λ1 . In addition,
let e > 0 satisfy

−e = 1, in 
e = 1, on ∂.
Another proof of Theorem 8.4.1 In order to apply Theorem 7.2.1 we have to prove
the existence of an ordered pair of sub- and super-solutions of (8.9). This is done in
two steps.
• Step 1. v = εϕ1 is a sub-solution of (8.9), provided ε > 0 is sufficiently small.
• Step 2. w = Me is a super-solution of (8.9), provided M is sufficiently large.
Step 1. Using the assumption γ0 > λ1 , there exists δ > 0 such that f (t) > λ1 t for all
t ∈ (0, δ). Then, if ε > 0 is such that ε|ϕ1 |∞ < δ, we get f (εϕ1 ) > λ1 εϕ1 and thus
−v = −εϕ1 = λ1 ε ϕ1 ≤ f (x, εϕ1 ) = f (x, v),

v|∂ = 0,

proving that v is a sub-solution of (8.9).
Step 2. Fixing δ > 0 such that δ|e|∞ < 1, γ+ < λ1 implies that f (x, Me) ≤ δMe
provided M > 0 is sufficiently large. Then w = Me satisfies
−w = M ≥ Mδ|e|∞ ≥ δMe ≥ f (x, Me),

w|∂ = M,

proving that w is a super-solution.
Moreover, by the Hopf lemma (see [58, Lemma 3.4]), there exists M > 0 such
that v = εϕ1 < w = Me in . Therefore, Theorem 7.2.1 applies and (8.9) has a

Remark 8.4.2 If f assumes negative values, e.g., if limu→+∞ f (x, u) < 0, then,
according to the discussion at the proof of Theorem 8.4.1 based on sub- supersolutions, any w ≡ b > 0 such that f (b) ≤ 0 can be taken as a super-solution
instead of Me. For ε > 0 sufficiently small, one has that εϕ1 < b and (8.9) has a
solution u such that 0 < εϕ1 ≤ u ≤ b.
Remark 8.4.3 Let us point out that, taking into account Lemma 7.2.6, the two proofs
of Theorem 8.4.1 are similar.
Theorem 8.4.4 If, in addition to the hypotheses of the preceding theorem, f (x, u) =
f (u) and g(u) := u−1 f (u) is decreasing for u > 0, then (8.9) has a unique positive
solution.
Proof The uniqueness result is based upon the following lemma which is interesting
in itself.
Lemma 8.4.5 Suppose that g(u) is decreasing for u > 0 and let v, w be a positive
sub-solution, resp. super-solution, of (8.9), satisfying v = w = 0 on ∂. Then v ≤ w
in .
Proof From the definition of sub- and super-solution we deduce
−vw + wv ≥ vf (w) − wf (v)
= vwg(w) − wvg(v) = vw[g(w) − g(v)].

Let χ(t) be smooth, nondecreasing and such that

Then (8.12) yields


[ − vw + wv]χε (v − w) = vw(g(w) − g(v))χε (v − w).

(8.13)

Let us evaluate the integral Iv,w,ε on the left-hand side of (8.13). Integrating by parts
(remember that v = w = 0 on ∂) we find



Iv,w,ε = vχε (v − w)∇w · (∇v − ∇w) − wχε (v − w)∇v · (∇v − ∇w)



+ (v − w)χε (v − w)∇v · (∇v − ∇w).

8.4 Positive Solutions

93

Since v > 0 and χε ≥ 0 we get

Iv,w,ε ≤ (v − w)χε (v − w)∇v · (∇v − ∇w).
Consider the last integral and set
γε (t) =

 t

sχε (s)ds.

With this notation, one has


(v − w)χε (v − w)∇v · (∇v − ∇w) = ∇v · ∇(γε (v − w)).
Moreover, an integration by parts yields


∇v · ∇(γε (v − w)) = − γε (v − w)v.
Since 0 ≤ γε (t) ≤ ε for all t ∈ R, we infer that


− γε (v − w)v ≤ f (v)γε (v − w) ≤ c ε,
for some c > 0. In conclusion, putting together the previous inequalities we get
Iv,w,ε ≤ c ε.
Inserting this bound in (8.13) we find

vw(g(w) − g(v))χε (v − w) ≤ c ε.
Passing to the limit as ε → 0 and taking into account the definition of χ , we deduce

vw(g(w) − g(v)) ≤ 0.
{x∈:v(x)>w(x)}

On the other hand, since g(u) = u−1 f (u) is decreasing, then
g(w) > g(v),

∀ x ∈  : v(x) > w(x).

Since v and w are positive, it follows that

vw(g(w) − g(v)) ≥ 0.
{x∈:v(x)>w(x)}

Then


{x∈:v(x)>w(x)}

vw(g(w) − g(v)) = 0,

and we conclude that the set {x ∈  : v(x) > w(x)} has zero Lebesgue measure.
This means that v ≤ w in , completing the proof.

Proof of Theorem 8.4.4 completed Let u1 , u2 be any pair of positive solutions to
(8.9). Applying Lemma 8.4.5 with v = u1 and w = u2 we get that u1 ≤ u2 . On
the other hand, we can also take v = u2 and w = u1 yielding u1 ≥ u2 . Therefore,
u1 = u2 , proving the theorem.

Example 8.4.6 (i) For 0 < q < 1, consider the problem

−u = λuq , in 
u = 0,
on ∂.

(8.14)

In this case, g(u) = λuq−1 ,
γ0 = lim+ g(u) = +∞,
u→0

γ+ = lim g(u) = 0,
u→+∞

and thus Theorems 8.4.1 and 8.4.4 yield the existence of a unique positive solution
of (8.14) for all λ > 0.
(ii) As a second application we can consider the problem

−u = αu − up , in 
(8.15)
u = 0,
on ∂,
with p > 1. Here g(u) = α − up−1 and
γ0 = lim+ g(u) = α,
u→0

γ+ = lim g(u) = −∞.
u→+∞

Hence Theorem 8.4.4 applies provided α > λ1 and yields a unique positive solution
uα of (8.15). Using Proposition 8.1.1, (8.15) has a trivial solution only provided that
0 ≤ α ≤ λ1 . Furthermore, in the present case bα = (α)1/(p−1) is a super-solution of
(8.15) because f (bα ) = 0. Then (8.15) has a solution uα such that εϕ1 ≤ uα < bα , see
Remark 8.4.2. Since bα → 0 as α → 0, from uα (x) < bα it follows that |uα |∞ → 0


as α → 0. This means that λ1 is a bifurcation point from the trivial solution.
Following with the last remark, we wish to see that from λ1 there branches off a
curve of positive solutions of (8.15). Actually, if we consider the problem

−u = λf (u), in 

u = 0,

for a function f ∈ C 1 (R+ ) such that
γ+ ≤ 0

Lemma 8.4.7 Suppose that f ∈ C 1 (R+ ) is such that

the first positive eigenvalue of


−u = λm(x)u,
u = 0,

in 
on ∂.

Proof The function uλ satisfies −uλ = λg(uλ )uλ , which implies that λ =
λk [g(uλ )] for some k ∈ N. Since uλ > 0, it follows that k = 1, namely λ = λ1 [g(uλ )].
By assumption, f  (uλ ) < g(uλ ) and hence the properties of the eigenvalues of (8.14)
(see Proposition 1.3.11) imply that λ1 [f  (uλ )] > λ1 [g(uλ )] = 1.

Theorem 8.4.8 Suppose that f ∈ C 1 (R+ ) satisfies (8.17) and (8.18). Then the
family {uλ : λ > ν} is a curve.
Proof Let X = {u ∈ C 2 ()∩C() : u(x) = 0, ∀ x ∈ ∂}, Y = C() and consider
the map F (λ, u) = u + λf (u). One has that F (λ, uλ ) = 0 for all λ > λ0 and the
linearized equation du F (λ, uλ )[φ] = 0 is the problem


−φ = λf  (uλ )φ, in 
φ = 0,
on ∂.

(8.19)

According to Lemma 8.4.7, λ1 [f  (uλ )] > 1 and therefore (8.19) has only the trivial
solution φ = 0. This allows us to apply the implicit function theorem to F (λ, u) = 0,
showing that the family {uλ : λ > ν} is a curve.


Remark 8.4.9 Theorem 8.4.8 applies to the Examples 8.4.6 (Eq. (8.15) is not in the
form (8.16), but in such a case the proof of Theorem 8.4.8 can be carried out with
uninfluential changes), proving that the family {uλ : λ > 0}, resp. {uλ : λ > λ1 }
is a curve of solutions of (8.14), resp. (8.15). In the latter case, taking also into
account that |uλ |∞ → 0 as λ → 0 (see Example 8.4.6-(i)), we can draw a diagram
representing the family {uλ : λ > 0} (see Fig. 8.1).
Our last result deals with the case f (x, 0) > 0. Since we use the abstract results in
Sect. 4.4, like in the preceding examples, it is convenient to introduce a real parameter
λ. Hence, instead of (8.9) , we consider the problem

Asymptotically Linear Problems

From now on we consider problems which do not possess a priori estimates of their
solutions. Specifically, this chapter deals with asymptotically linear problems. For
this class of equations it is quite natural to use the bifurcation from infinity. The
classical Landesman–Lazer existence result is found by this method as well as by
using a variational approach. The bifurcation from infinity also leads to proving the
anti-maximum principle.

9.1

Existence of Positive Solutions

We give here some of the existence results in the work [14]. Specifically, we study
the existence of positive solutions of the boundary value problem
−u = λf (u), x ∈ 
u = 0,
x ∈ ∂,

(9.1)

where  is a bounded open subset of RN , λ > 0 and f ∈ C 1 ([0, +∞)), with
f (0) = 0 and with positive right derivative f+ (0) = m0 > 0.
First, as in Sect. 8.4, we reduce the study of the existence of positive solutions to
the existence of solutions of an extended problem. Indeed, we extend f to ( − ∞, 0)
by defining f (s) = f (0) for s < 0. With this extension, the maximum principle
implies that every nontrivial solution of (9.1) is positive.
Now, take X = C(), K : X −→ X the inverse of the Laplacian operator and
consider the operator  : [0, ∞) × X −→ X given by (λ, u) = u − λK[f (u)], for
every λ ≥ 0 and u ∈ X. As in Sect. 7.1, we can rewrite the extended problem (9.1)
as the zeros of , i.e.
(λ, u) = 0.
Theorem 9.1.1 If f (0) = 0 and f+ (0) = m0 > 0, then λ0 = λ1 /m0 is the unique
bifurcation point from zero of positive solutions of (9.1). In addition, the continuum
emanating from (λ0 , 0) is unbounded.

9 Asymptotically Linear Problems

Proof To apply Theorem 6.3.1 we just have to prove the change of index of (λ, ·)
as λ crosses λ = λ0 . The proof is based on the following claims.
• Claim 1. There exists λ0 > 0 such that for every interval  ⊂ [0, +∞) \ {λ0 }
there is ε > 0 satisfying
(λ, u) = 0,

∀λ ∈ ,

∀0 < u < ε.

• Claim 2. For every λ > λ0 there exists δ > 0 such that
(λ, u) = τ ϕ1 ,

∀0 < u < δ,

∀τ ≥ 0.

To prove Claim 1, we argue by contradiction assuming that there exists a sequence
(λn , un ) ∈  × X satisfying
λn −→ λ = λ0 ,
(λn , un ) = 0,

un  −→ 0,
un ≥ 0.

Since K is compact, dividing the equation un = λn K [f (un )] by un , we deduce
that, up to a subsequence, un un −1 strongly converges to some v ∈ X. Necessarily,
v is an eigenfunction of norm one associated to λ, i.e., it satisfies
v = λK[m0 v],

v = 1.

In particular, v > 0. Using ϕ1 as a test function in this eigenvalue problem we obtain


λ1 vϕ1 = λm0 vϕ1 ,
and we conclude that λ1 = λm0 , which is a contradiction and the proof of Claim 1
is finished.
As a consequence of Claim 1 we obtain
(a) The unique possible bifurcation point of positive solutions is λ = λ0 .
(b) If λ < λ0 and we take  = [0, λ] then
i (λ , 0) = i (0 , 0) = i (I , 0) = 1.
With respect to the proof of Claim 2, we fix λ > λ0 and we assume, by contradiction,
that there exist sequences un ∈ X and τn ≥ 0 satisfying un > 0 in , un  −→ 0
and
(λ, un ) = τn ϕ1 ,
or, equivalently,
un = λK[f (un )] + τn ϕ1 .
Dividing this equation by un  and using the compactness of K, we deduce that,
up to a subsequence, K[f (un )/un ] is convergent and hence τn /un  is bounded.

9.2 Bifurcation from Infinity

99

Passing again to a subsequence, if necessary, we can assume that τn /un  −→ τ ≥ 0
and un /un  −→ v with v ∈ X satisfying
−v = λf  (0)v + τ λ1 ϕ1 ,
v = 0,
v = 1.

x∈
x ∈ ∂

As in Claim 1, we deduce then that λf  (0) = λ1 , a contradiction.
As a by-product of Claim 2, if λ > λ0 , we derive that
i (λ , 0) = i (λ − τ ϕ1 , 0),

∀τ > 0.

But, again using Claim 2, the problem
−w = λf (w) + τ ϕ1 ,
w = 0,

x∈
x ∈ ∂

has no nontrivial solution. Since, w = 0 is not a solution provided that τ > 0, we
deduce that the last index is zero, i.e.,
i (λ , 0) = 0,

∀λ > λ0 ,

and we have proved the change of index.

Remark 9.2.3 Assume that the hypotheses of Theorems 9.1.1 and 9.2.2 are satisfied.

the reader can use the Maximum principle to verify that problem (9.1) has no
solution (λ, u) in the strip of R × C() given by θ1 ≤ u∞ ≤ θ2 . Therefore, in

(9.2)

In a similar way to the preceding results, it is possible to prove the following result.
Theorem 9.3.1 The value λ0 = λ1 is the unique bifurcation point from infinity of
positive solutions of (9.2). Moreover, if g(0) = 0, then λ = λ1 − g  (0) is the unique
bifurcation point from zero of positive solutions of (9.2). In addition, there exists a
continuum “connecting” (λ1 − g  (0), 0) with (λ1 , ∞).
Proof The bifurcation from zero at λ1 − g  (0) and the bifurcation from infinity at
λ1 are deduced as in the preceding theorems. On the other hand, since g is C 1 , there
exists α > 0 such that αu > g(u) > −αu for u > 0. Then the problem (9.2) has no
solution provided that |λ| ! 0 and, therefore, the continuum emanating from zero
at λ1 − g  (0) is also bifurcating from infinity at λ1 .


Remark 9.3.2 In particular, there exists a solution of (9.2) for every λ in the interval
of extrema λ1 and λ1 − g  (0). However, in the cases that we are able to establish the

102

side of the bifurcations from infinity and from zero, we will improve this existence
result.
The side of the bifurcation from zero is completely described by the following
theorem. Without loss of generality, we assume that g  (0) = 0.
Theorem 9.3.3 If g  (0) = 0 and there exists ε > 0 such that
g(u) ≥ 0,

∀u ∈ (0, ε),

(9.3)

then the bifurcation from zero of Theorem 9.3.1 is to the left (see Fig. 9.3). Similarly,
if the inequality in (9.3) is reversed, then the bifurcation from zero is to the right.
Proof If (λn , un ) ∈ R × X are solutions of (9.2) with λn → λ1 and un  → 0,
then, as we have seen in the proof of Claim 1 of Theorem 9.1.1, up to a subsequence
un /un  converges to ϕ1 . Using this eigenfunction as a test function in the equation
satisfied by un , we obtain


(λ1 − λn ) un ϕ1 =
g(un )ϕ1 .




Since 0 < un is uniformly convergent to zero, we deduce by (9.3) that g(un (x)) ≥ 0,
for every x ∈  and hence that λn ≤ λ1 .
The result for the reversed inequalities is proved similarly.

With respect to the bifurcation from infinity we can prove the following result.
Theorem 9.3.4 [24] If there exists ε > 0 such that
g(u)u2 ≥ ε,

∀u ! 0,

(9.4)

then the bifurcation from infinity of the preceding theorem is to the left (see Fig. 9.4).
Similarly, if the inequality in (9.4) is reversed, then the bifurcation from infinity is to
the right.

(9.5)

For the general case we refer to [24].
If (λn , un ) ∈ R × X are solutions of (9.2) with λn → λ1 and un  → ∞, then,
up to a subsequence, un /un  converges to ϕ1 . Using this eigenfunction as a test

Remark 9.3.5 In [24], some counterexamples show that, in general, if the nonlinearity g is below any quadratic hyperbola c/s 2 , then the side of the bifurcation from

in [55, 56].

3. If hϕ1 = 0, then every solution (λ, uλ ) of (9.6) with λ = λ1 changes sign in .

Remark 9.4.2 In [41, Theorem 2] Clement and Peletier proved a slightly less general
version of the cases 1(a) and 2(a) of this theorem. Indeed, these authors substituted
the condition of the sign of the integral of uϕ1 by a condition on the sign of h in
all .
Proof We start with case 1. Note that by the Fredholm alternative, the linear problem
(9.6) has no solution for λ = λ1 , and there is a unique solution if λ is not an eigenvalue
of the Laplacian operator. In addition, for X = W 2,r (), the value λ = λ1 is a
bifurcation point “from +∞” in the sense that there are solutions (λ, uλ ) emanating
from λ1 at infinity such that uλ /uλ  is converging in W 2,r () ⊂ C 1 () to ϕ1 as λ
tends to λ1 . Also, there is a bifurcation “from −∞”, i.e., solutions (λ, uλ ) emanating
from λ1 at infinity such that uλ /uλ  is converging to −ϕ1 as λ tends to λ1 . (See
Fig. 9.5 for the bifurcation diagram.) Now it is immediate to conclude from the
preceding section that the bifurcation from +∞ is to the right, while the bifurcation

from −∞ is to the left. The proof of 1 is thus concluded. The argument for 2 is
similar.
Finally, to prove 3, it suffices to take ϕ1 as a test function
in (9.6) to conclude

that every solution (λ, u) of this problem satisfies (λ1 − λ)

sign.

Remark 9.4.3 1. The choice of r > N allows us to apply our bifurcation results
which involve the space X = W 2,r (), continuously embedded in C 1 (). This
fact allows us to ensure that the normalized solutions converge to ϕ1 (or to −ϕ1 )
in the C 1 -topology. Since ϕ1 lies in the interior of the cone of positive functions
of C 1 (), then the positivity (or negativity) of the solutions near the bifurcation
point easily follows. On the contrary, if we consider r ≤ N , such an argument
does not work, and in fact the result is not true, as is proved in [85].
2. A related result for elliptic problems with nonlinear boundary conditions is given
in [25].

9.5 The Landesman–Lazer Condition
The case of (9.2) with λ = λ1 is particularly interesting. Thus in this section we
study the problem

u(x) = 0,

x ∈ ,
x ∈ ∂,

The classical result by Landesman and Lazer [62] related to resonance at the principal
eigenvalue λ1 states the following.
Theorem 9.5.1 Assume, in addition to (9.8) and (9.9), one of the following two
conditions:


g−∞ ϕ1 ,
(9.10)
g+∞ ϕ1 < 0 <
or

Then (9.7) admits at least one solution.
Proof We approach the problem (9.7) by embedding it into a one parameter family
of problems as follows:
−u = λu + g(x, u),
u(x) = 0,

x ∈ ,
x ∈ ∂,

(9.12)

with λ ∈ R. Observe that the boundedness of the function g ensures that bifurcation
from infinity for problem (9.12) occurs at λ1 . In addition, by taking ϕ1 as a test
function in (9.12), it is easily deduced that if the condition (9.10) holds then the
bifurcation from infinity is to the right. Similarly, if (9.11) holds, the bifurcation
from infinity is to the left.
As we will see, the behavior of the bifurcations from infinity at λ1 for problem
(9.12) determines the existence of solution for the resonant problem (9.7). The key
to relate these two problems is to interpret the concepts of bifurcations to the left
and to the right in the sense of a priori bounds for the norms of the solutions. From
this point of view, observe that every possible bifurcation from ∞ at λ1 is to the left
(resp. to the right) if and only if there exist ε > 0 and M > 0 such that every solution
(λ, u) of (9.12) with λ ∈ [λ1 , λ1 + ε] (resp. λ ∈ [λ1 − ε, λ1 ]) satisfies u ≤ M.
Here we just complete the proof in the case that condition (9.11) holds, when the
bifurcation from ∞ is to the left. In other words, there exists ε > 0 and M > 0 such
that
u ≤ M
for every solution (λ, u) of (9.12) with λ1 ≤ λ ≤ λ1 + ε.
Taking into account for every λ which is not an eigenvalue, that there exists at least
a solution (λ, u) of (9.12) (see Theorem 8.3.3), we can choose a sequence (λn , un )
of solutions with λn → λ1 , λn > λ1 , ∀n ∈ N. Then un  ≤ M for n large and the

compactness of K proves that a subsequence of un must converge to a solution of
the resonant problem (9.7).

Remark 9.5.2 The previous general results of the side of bifurcations from infinity
can be applied to obtain an improvement of the above classical existence result
(see [24]).

9.5.1 A Variational Proof of the Landesman–Lazer Result
In this section we complete the study of problem (9.7) by giving another proof of
Theorem 9.5.1. This is based on variational techniques and shows that the solutions
found are essentially of different variational nature according to the fact that either
(9.10) or (9.11) is satisfied.
Variational proof of Theorem 9.5.1 Consider the functional J : H01 () −→ R
defined for every u ∈ H01 () by

where, as usual G(x, s) = 0 g(x, t) dt.
Lemma 9.5.3 Assume that either (9.10) or (9.11) is satisfied. Then the functional
J satisfies the Palais–Smale condition.
Proof Assume that {un } satisfies
J (un ) ≤ C,

∀n ∈ N,

and
|J  (un ), v| ≤ n v ∀n ∈ N ,

(9.14)

with C > 0 and εn tending to zero.
The proof will be finished if we prove that {un } is bounded in H01 () (see
Lemma 7.1.1). Suppose, by contradiction, that un  converges to +∞ (up to a
subsequence), and define zn = un /un . Thus {zn } is bounded in H01 () and hence,
up to subsequences, converges to a function z weakly in H01 () and strongly in
L2 (). Dividing (9.13) by un 2 , we get (using only the fact that J (un ) is bounded

Letting n tend to infinity, we get

Suppose that, for example, zn converges to +ϕ1 . Then un (x) tends to +∞ for almost

g(x, un (x)) → g+∞ (x)

for almost every x ∈ ,

h(x, un (x)) → g+∞ (x)

for almost every x ∈ .

Consequently, the properties of g and G, and the Lebesgue theorem imply

[g(x, un ) zn − 2 h(x, un ) zn ] = − g+∞ ϕ1 ,

Remark 9.5.4 We explicitly remark that in the above proof it is shown that “for every
sequence un such that J (un ) is bounded from above and un  converges to +∞, we
have, up to a subsequence, the strong convergence of un /un  to ±ϕ1 .”
Variational proof of Theorem 9.5.1 completed Once we have proved that J satisfies
the Palais–Smale condition, we study the geometry of J which depends strongly on
the conditions (9.10) and (9.11). The proof is divided into two steps.
Step 1. If (9.11) holds, we will see that J is coercive and hence (see Theorem 5.4.1)
it has a global minimizer, which concludes the proof in this case. Indeed, suppose by
contradiction that J is not coercive, that is, that there exists a sequence un such that
J (un ) is bounded from above and un  converges to +∞. Applying Remark 9.5.4,
we can assume that un /un  is strongly convergent to ±ϕ1 and thus

provided un /un  converges to ϕ1 (resp. −ϕ1 ). In any case we obtain a contradiction
with the hypothesis (9.11), which proves that J is coercive and thus the theorem.

Step 2. If (9.10) holds, we follow an argument close to that one used in Case 2 of the
variational proof of Theorem 8.3.3 given in Sect. 8.3.3, namely we obtain a solution
by applying the Theorem 5.3.8 to J . Indeed, again by the L’Hôpital rule, using (9.8)
and (9.10), we deduce that

Asymmetric Nonlinearities

This chapter deals with nonlinear problems with nonlinearities whose behavior at
+∞ and −∞ jumps through an eigenvalue of the linear part. Specifically, we come
back to the problem

−u = f (u) + h(x), x ∈ ,
(10.1)
u = 0,
x ∈ ∂,
where  is a bounded open set in RN and h ∈ C(). On f ∈ C 1 (R) we assume:

(i) Setting f (u) = g(u)u for u = 0, ∃γ± = limu→±∞ g(u).⎬
(10.2)
⎭
(ii) 0 < γ− < λ1 < γ+ < λ2 .
We first discuss the case in which the precise solutions number can be found by
using the global inversion theorem with singularities stated in Sect. 3.5. Moreover,
we show how some multiplicity results can be obtained by using sub- and supersolutions jointly with degree arguments or with variational arguments. In Sect. 10.4
we employ the topological degree to find continua of solutions.

10.1 The Approach by Ambrosetti and Prodi
We begin the study of our problem by following the ideas of [16] which use the
global inversion theorem with singularities.
Theorem 10.1.1 Let f ∈ C 2 (R, R) and suppose that (10.2) holds and that f  (u) >
0, for every u ∈ R. Then Y := C 0,ν () = Y0 ∪ Y1 ∪ Y2 , where
1. Y1 is a C 1 submanifold of codimension 1 in Y and (10.1) has a unique solution
in X := C 2,ν (), for every h ∈ Y1 ;
2. (10.1) has no solution in X, for every h ∈ Y0 ;
3. (10.1) has exactly two solutions in X, for every h ∈ Y2 .
The proof will be deduced by the following lemma. We keep the notation introduced
in Sect. 8.3.1. In particular, we let F (u) = −u − f (u), u ∈ X.

10 Asymmetric Nonlinearities

Lemma 10.1.2 (i) F is proper.
(ii) The singular set   of F is not empty, closed, connected and every u ∈   is an
ordinary singular point.
(iii) For every h ∈   , F (u) = h has a unique solution.
Proof (i) To prove the properness of F we argue in a similar way to the proof of
Lemma 8.3.1. We limit ourselves to indicating the changes. As before, if uk ∈ X
satisfies F (uk ) = hk ∈ Y and hk is bounded, then we claim that uk is bounded
in C 0,ν (). Otherwise, up to a subsequence, zk := uk uk −1 converges to some
z ∈ C 1 (), with z = 1, which solves (8.4), where a is given by (8.5). Since z = 0,
it follows that λj (a) = 1 for some integer j ≥ 1. Since a < λ2 the comparison of the
eigenvalues (Proposition 1.3.11-(i)) implies that λ1 (a) = 1. Then the eigenfunction
z is either positive or negative in  and hence a equals either γ+ or γ− . Since both
γ± are not eigenvalues of the Laplace operator, we get a contradiction. The rest is as
in Lemma 8.3.1.
(ii) Fix z ∈ X with z > 0 and write u = tz + w, with t ∈ R and w ∈ (Rz)⊥ .
Remember that u ∈   whenever
−v = f  (tz + w)v,

v∈X

has a nontrivial solution, namely if λ1 [f  (tz + w)] = 1. Since f  ≥ 0, f  (tz + w) >
f  (sz+w) provided t > s and thus, by (Proposition 1.3.11-(i)), t  → λ1 [f  (tz+w)] is
decreasing. Moreover, by case ii) of the same proposition and from f  (tz + w) → γ−
as t → −∞, resp. f  (tz + w) → γ+ as t → +∞, it follows that λ1 [f  (tz + w)] →
λ1 /γ− as t → −∞, resp. λ1 [f  (tz + w)] → λ1 /γ+ as t → +∞. Then there exists
a unique t ∗ such that λ1 [f  (tz + w)] = 1. This shows that   is not empty and
has a Cartesian representation on (Rz)⊥ , proving the first part of (ii). Since u ∈  
whenever λ1 [f  (u)] = 1, there exists ϕ ∈ X, which does not change sign in ,
such that Ker dF (u) = Rϕ and Range dF (u) = Ker ψ where ψ, h = hϕ. Since
d 2 F (u)[ϕ, ϕ] = f  (u)ϕ 2 we get

ψ, d 2 F (u)[ϕ, ϕ] = f  (u)ϕ 3 = 0
because f  (u) > 0, proving that u is an ordinary singular point.
(iii) By contradiction, let u = v be singular points such that F (u) = F (v). Setting

λ1 [f  (v)] < 1 = λ1 [a], a contradiction with the fact that v ∈   .

Remark 10.1.3 In the preceding proof or, more specifically, in the verification of case

v = 0,
x ∈ ∂,
provided that α and β lie between two consecutive eigenvalues. The set  of the
pairs (α, β) such that (10.3) has nontrivial solutions is called the Fučik spectrum.
It was Fučik [53] who gave a complete description of it in the case N = 1. With
respect to the case N ≥ 2, in Dancer [43], it is shown that the two lines {λ1 } × R and
R × {λ1 } are isolated in , and in Gallouët and Kavian [54], it is proved that from
each pair (λk , λk ) emanates a curve Sk−1 in . A variational characterization of the
curve S1 emanating from (λ2 , λ2 ) is given in De Figueiredo and Gossez [49], where,
in addition, it is proved that S1 is asymptotic to the lines {λ1 } × R and R × {λ1 }. In
[28] the description of the spectrum in the radial case is given.

10.2 The Approach by Amann–Hess
In the following sections, we study different approaches to (10.1). We anticipate that
we will not assume f  ≥ 0 but we will only obtain estimates from below of the
number of solutions. Specifically, this section is devoted to studying the approach
due to Amann and Hess [4]. It combines the method of the sub-super-solutions with
degree arguments to prove the existence of solutions for the problem
−u = f (u) + tϕ(x) + h(x), x ∈ ,
u = 0,
x ∈ ∂,

(10.4t)

where ϕ, h ∈ C(), ϕ(x) > 0 for x ∈ , f ∈ C 1 (R) and there exist the limits
γ± = limu→±∞ g(u) with g(u) = f (u)/u, for u = 0.
First, we need to prove the following lemmas.
Lemma 10.2.1 If (10.2) is satisfied, then the solutions of (10.4t ) are uniformly
bounded on compact sets of t, i.e., for every compact interval  ⊂ R, there exists
R > 0 such that every solution u of (10.4t ) with t ∈  satisfies
uC 1 ≤ R.
Proof Suppose on the contrary that un is a solution of (10.4tn ) with tn bounded
and un C 1 → ∞. Using that tn /un C 1 converges to zero we deduce that zn =
un /un C 1 strongly converges to a nonzero solution z of (8.4). As has been seen in
Lemma 10.1.2, this problem has only the zero solution and we obtain a contradiction,
proving the lemma.


Following McKenna–Walter [70] we also prove the following nonexistence result.

114

10 Asymmetric Nonlinearities

Lemma 10.2.2 If hypothesis (10.2) holds, then there exists ε0 > 0 such that for each
0 < ε < ε0 there is tε ∈ R such that for every t < tε and λ ∈ [0, 1], the problem
−u = λf (u) + tϕ + h, x ∈ ,
u=0
x ∈ ∂,
has no solution in ∂B|t|ε (tφ) = {u ∈ C01 () : u − tφC 1 = |t|ε}, where φ denotes
the unique solution in C01 () of −φ = ϕ in .
Proof Let ε0 > 0 be such that φC 1 > ε0 , φ22 − ε0 ϕ1 > 0 and λ2 ε0 ϕ1 <
λ21 φ22 − ε0 ϕ1 . We argue by contradiction and suppose that for some ε ∈ (0, ε0 )
there exist sequences tn ∈ R, λn ∈ [0, 1] and un ∈ C01 () with tn → −∞, λn →
λ ∈ [0, 1] and  utnn − φC 1 = ε, satisfying
−un = λn f (un ) + tn ϕ + h,

x ∈ .

Since  utnn − φC 1 = ε, the sequence zn := un /tn is bounded. Moreover, un C 1 →
∞, because otherwise zn → 0 in C01 () and thus 0 ∈ Bε (φ), which is impossible by
the choice of ε0 .
On the other hand, there exists z ∈ H01 () such that (up to a subsequence) zn → z
weakly in H01 (), strongly in L2 () and zn (x) → z(x) a.e. x ∈ . Arguing as before,
we deduce the strong convergence of zn to z. Consequently, z − φC 1 = ε.
Dividing by tn the equation satisfied by un and taking limits as n tends to infinity,
we deduce from (10.2) that z satisfies the following equation:
−z = λa(x)z + ϕ,

x∈

where a(x) is given by (8.5). Since z = φ, we have λ = 0. We claim that z is
non-negative. Indeed, by taking z− := min{z, 0} as a test function in the equation
satisfied by z and using that γ− < λ1 , we obtain from Corollary 1.3.9

satisfied by φ to get

If δ < 1/λ1 , w = δλϕ1 is a sub-solution of this problem. We can choose δ
small enough to conclude that w ≤ z. The method of sub- and super-solution
(Theorem 7.2.1) allows us to deduce the existence of a non-negative, nontrivial solution. As a consequence, because we have previously shown that λ < λλ21 ,


λ = γλ+1 > λλ21 , which is a contradiction.
Theorem 10.2.3 If condition (10.2) holds, then there exists a number t ∗ ∈ R such
that the problem (10.4t ) has
• no solution if t > t ∗ ,
• at least one solution if t = t ∗
• and at least two solutions if t < t ∗ .
Proof We begin by observing that hypothesis (10.2) means that there exist δ < λ1 < δ
and C > 0 such that
f (s) ≥ δs − C

(10.5)

f (s) ≥ δs − C,

(10.6)

and

for s ∈ R.
We show first that problem (10.4t ) has no solution provided that t is large enough.
Indeed, this is deduced by taking a first eigenfunction ϕ1 > 0 as a test function to
obtain




λ1 uϕ1 = f (u)ϕ1 + t ϕϕ1 + hϕ1 .

Hence, if u is a solution of (10.4t ) with uϕ1 ≥ 0, then, by (10.6),






t ϕϕ1 ≤ (λ1 − δ) uϕ1 − C ϕ1 − hϕ1 ≤ −C ϕ1 − hϕ1
and the positiveness of ϕ (and of ϕ1 ) implies that t is bounded from above. A similar
argument using (10.5) (instead of (10.6)) shows the same if uϕ1 < 0.

10 Asymmetric Nonlinearities

Consequently, the set S := {t ∈ R : (10.4t ) admits a solution} is bounded from
above. The rest of the proof is divided into two steps:
Step 1 S is a nonempty closed interval, i.e., there exists t ∗ such that S = (−∞, t ∗ ].
Step 2 Problem (10.4t ) has at least two solutions for t < t ∗ .
Proof of Step 1 First we apply Lemma 10.2.2 to prove that S is not the empty
set. In order to do that we use the Leray–Schauder degree. Let t < tε (where tε
is given by Lemma 10.2.2) and t (u) = u − K(f (u) + tϕ + h) where, as usual,
K : C01 () −→ C01 () is the inverse operator of the Laplacian operator in the space
C01 (). By the invariance of the Leray–Schauder degree, Lemma 10.2.2 implies that
deg (t , B|t|ε (tφ), 0) = deg (I − K(tϕ), B|t|ε (tφ), 0) = 1.
Then there exists a solution of (10.4t ) in B|t|ε (tϕ) and the set S is not empty.
Now, we observe that S is an interval unbounded from below. Indeed, if t0 ∈ S
then there exists a solution u0 of (10.4t0 ). Clearly, it is a super-solution for (10.4t )
for every t < t0 . Moreover, if ut is the unique solution of the linear problem

−u = δu − C + tϕ(x) + h(x), x ∈ ,
u = 0,
x ∈ ∂,
then condition (10.5) implies that ut is a sub-solution of (10.4t ) with −ut ≤ −u0
(already we have just proved that ut is less than or equal to every super-solution of
(10.4t )) and thus, by the maximum principle, ut ≤ u0 . Therefore, the sub-supersolution method1 (Theorem 7.2.1) applies, and we conclude that (−∞, t0 ] ⊂ S and
S is an interval unbounded from below.
Let t ∗ = sup S. To conclude the proof of Step 1, it suffices to show that t ∗ ∈ S. To
this end let {tn } be a sequence in S converging to t ∗ . For every tn , let un be a solution
of (10.4tn ), i.e., un = K(f (un ) + tn ϕ + h). By Lemma 10.2.1, un C 1 is bounded
and from the compactness of K we deduce that—up to a subsequence— un strongly
converges to a solution of (10.4t∗ ) and t ∗ ∈ S.
Proof of Step 2 Fix t < t ∗ and let u∗ be a solution of (10.4t ∗ ). Then, as we have
seen in the first step, u∗ (resp. ut ) is a super-solution (resp. a sub- solution) of (10.4t )
with ut ≤ u∗ . Further, by the strong maximum principle and the Hopf lemma (see
∗
∂u

on ∂. Thus, we can define
[58, Lemma 3.4]) we have ut < u∗ in  and ∂u

Let t (u) = I − K(f (u) + tϕ + h). By Lemma 7.2.3, there is R > 0 such that
deg (t , Ut (R), 0) = 1 which, by the existence property of the degree, implies the
existence of a first solution of (10.4t ) in Ut (R). The key idea to find the second
solution of (10.4t ) is to compute the degree of t in BR (0) and to use the excision

Indeed, by Remark 2.2.3, we deduce the existence of a minimal solution of (10.4t ).

property. Indeed, by Lemma 10.2.1, if t1 > t ∗ , R may be chosen such that uC 1 < R
for each solution u of (10.4s ) with s ∈ [t, t1 ]. Using the homotopy invariance of the
Leray–Schauder degree and the fact that problem (Pt1 ) has no solution, we get
deg (t , BR (0), 0) = deg (t1 , BR (0), 0) = 0.
Therefore, the excision property of the degree implies that
deg (t , BR (0) \ Ut (R), 0) = deg (t , BR (0), 0) − deg (t , Ut (R), 0) = −1
which means that, in addition to the solution of (10.4t ) in Ut (R), there exists a
second solution in BR (0) \ Ut (R). Therefore, Step 2 has been proved and thus the
theorem.

10.3 Variational Approach by Mountain Pass and Sub- and
Super-Solutions
We devote this section to discuss a different proof [51] of the existence of the second
solution in Theorem 10.2.3. This is based on variational arguments. Specifically, in
the proof given in the previous section we have seen that the set S = {t ∈ R :
(10.4t ) admits a solution} = (−∞, t ∗ ] and that for every t ∈ (−∞, t ∗ ] there exist
a sub-solution and a super-solution of (10.4t ) which are well ordered. By applying
Lemma 6 there exists a solution u1 of (10.4t ) which is (between the sub-solution and
the super-solution and) a local minimizer of the functional

Remark 10.3.1 Since we devoted this section to apply variational methods, it is
really worthwhile to see that, if ϕ = ϕ1 , then the mountain pass theorem may also
be applied to prove that the set S of all t for which problem (10.4t ) can be solved is
not empty (i.e., a variational proof of Step 1 of the proof of Theorem 10.2.3). Indeed,
we are going to show that (10.4

speaking, since the first eigenvalue in W of the Laplacian operator is λ2 (remember

holds, we deduce that

10.4 Approach by Degree Giving a Continuum of Solutions
In this section, we follow the ideas of [20, 21] and apply Theorem 4.4.2 to give an
alternative proof of Theorem 10.2.3. Specifically, we prove the following result.
Theorem 10.4.1 Let ϕ ∈ L∞ () be a positive function and let f : R −→ R be
a C 1 function satisfying (10.2). Let t ∗ be the supremum of all t ∈ R such that
problem (10.4t ) admits a solution. Then t ∗ is finite and there exists a continuum C in
 ≡ {(t, u) ∈ R × C01 () : u solution of (10.4t )} satisfying that
1. (−∞, t ∗ ] ⊂ ProjR C.
2. For every t ∈ (−∞, t ∗ ), the t-slice Ct = {u ∈ C01 () : (t, u) ∈ C} contains two
distinct solutions of (10.4t ).
Remark 10.4.2 As a consequence, we recover the assertion of Theorem 10.2.3:
(10.4t ) has, at least, two (resp. one, zero) solutions for t < t ∗ (resp. t ≤ t ∗ , t > t ∗ ).
Proof As we have seen in the proof of Theorem 10.2.3 in Sect. 10.2, S = {t ∈ R :
(10.4t ) admits a solution} = (−∞, t ∗ ]. Observe that the family t ∗ of the solutions
of (10.4t ∗ ) is clearly a compact set in C01 (). Let u∗ be the minimal solution of
(10.4t ∗ ) and choose t0 < t ∗ . We have seen in Step 1 of the proof of Theorem 10.2.3
that it is possible to pick a sub-solution ut0 < u∗ of (10.4t0 ) which is not a solution.
Clearly ut0 is also a sub-solution and not a solution for (10.4t ) if t ∈ [t0 , t ∗ ]. As in the
proof of Theorem 10.2.3, there is R > 0 such that, if t (u) = I − K(f (u) + tϕ + h)
and
Ut0 (R) = {u ∈ C01 () : ut0 < u < u∗ in ,

∂ut0
∂u∗

on ∂} ∩ BR (0),
<
<
∂n
∂n
∂n

then deg (t , Ut0 (R), 0) = 1, for every t ∈ [t0 , t ∗ ).
Applying Theorem 4.4.2 with X = C01 (), [a, b] = [t0 , t ∗ ], U = BR (0) and
U1 = Ut0 (R), we deduce the existence of a continuum St0 in  such that
St0 ∩ ({t0 } × Ut0 (R)) = ∅,
and
St0 ∩ ({t0 } × [BR (0) \ Ut0 (R)]) = ∅.
In particular, the continuum St0 crosses {t} × ∂Ut0 (R), for some t ∈ (t0 , t ∗ ]. It has
been observed that, by the strong comparison principle, this is possible if and only if
t = t ∗ . Consequently, the choice of u∗ implies that St0 crosses {t ∗ } × ∂Ut0 (R) exactly
in (t ∗ , u∗ ). This proof is concluded by taking C = ∪t0 <t ∗ St0 .


Remark 10.4.3 We will see in the next chapter that the above proof can cover the
case of a nonlinearity f such that γ+ = +∞ (superlinear at +∞).

Chapter 11

Superlinear Problems

This chapter deals with superlinear problems, i.e., nonlinear Dirichlet boundary value
problems whose nonlinearity f (u) is superlinear at ∞, namely
lim

u→+∞

f (u)
= +∞.
u

In this case an appropriate approach seems to be critical point theory. Actually, the
mountain pass theorem or the linking theorem can be used to find solutions. We also
show how to study superlinear problems by using the topological degree.

11.1

Using Min–Max Theorems

We will find solutions of problems with a superlinear nonlinearity by means of the
min-max theorems proved in Sects. 5.3 and 5.5. For the reader’s convenience we
will first consider the model case

−u = λu + |u|p−1 u, x ∈ 
(11.1)
u = 0,
x ∈ ∂,
where λ ≥ 0 is a parameter and 1 < p < 2∗ − 1. Let us remark that 2∗ is given by
(7.3). The solutions of (11.1) are the critical points of
Jλ (u) = 21 u2 − 21 λu22 − H(u),

u ∈ E = H01 (),



where
1
H(u) = p+1

|u|p+1 .

Lemma 11.1.1 If 1 < p < 2∗ − 1, then Jλ satisfies the (P S)c for all c > 0.
Proof Let un ∈ E be such that Jλ (un ) → c and Jλ (un ) → 0. From the former,
resp. the latter multiplied by un , we get

un 2 − λun 22 − (H (un ) | un ) = o(1).
From the first identity we infer un 2 − λun 22 = 2H(un ) + 2c + o(1) and, inserting
this into the second one, we deduce that
(H (un ) | un ) = 2H(un ) + 2c + o(1).

(11.2)

Using the homogeneity of H (H (u)(u) = (p + 1)H(u)), we have
(p − 1)H(un ) = 2c + o(1).
Then p > 1 and the definition of H imply that un is bounded in Lp () and this
shows that un 22 + H(un ) is bounded. Therefore un  is also bounded. The rest of
the proof follows from Lemma 7.1.1.


Remark 11.1.2 The homogeneity of H can be substituted by the condition
H(u) ≤ θ (H (u) | u),

θ ∈ (0, 21 ).

(11.3)

Actually, using (11.3) in (11.2) we get
H(un ) ≤ θ (H (un ) | un ) = 2θ H(un ) + 2θc + o(1),
namely,
(1 − 2θ )H(un ) ≤ 2θ c + o(1),
and the conclusion follows in the same way.
The geometrical properties of the functional Jλ depend on the value λ. Indeed, since
the characteristic values of the operator λA are the decreasing sequence μj = λλ1 j
(j = 1, 2 . . . ), applying Examples 5.3.1 and 5.5.1, we have the following result on
the verification of the conditions (J 1)–(J 4) introduced in Sects. 5.3 and 5.5.
Lemma 11.1.3 (i) If λ < λ1 , then Jλ satisfies (J 1) and (J 2).
(ii) If λk ≤ λ < λk+1 , k ≥ 1, then Jλ satisfies (J 3) and (J 4), with V =
span {ϕ1 , . . . , ϕk }.


The preceding lemmas allow us to apply the mountain pass theorem 5.3.6, resp.
the min–max theorem 5.5.3, provided λ < λ1 , resp. λk ≤ λ < λk+1 , yielding a
nontrivial critical point of Jλ and hence a nontrivial solution of (11.1). Furthermore,
if λ < λ1 , we can assert that the solution is positive in . Indeed, the same previous
arguments work to prove the existence of a solution if we substitute the nonlinearity
|u|p−1 u with its positive part. In addition, we deduce by the maximum principle that
the solution we find is positive.
Similar arguments apply to the problem
−u = λu + f (x, u), x ∈ ,
u = 0,
x ∈ ∂,
where f ∈ C 1 ( × R, R) satisfies

(11.4)

(iii) ∃ θ ∈ (0, 21 ) such that, letting F (x, u) = 0 f (x, s)ds,
0 < F (x, u) ≤ θ uf (x, u),

∀ x ∈ ,

∀u > 0.

(11.5)

In this more general case the preceding arguments require some modifications that
we are going to outline.
it suffices to point out that now one has that H(u) =
 As for the (P S) condition,
F (x, u) dx as well as (H (u) | u) = uf (x, u) dx and hence assumption (iii)
implies that (11.3) holds.
The verifications of (J 1) or (J 3) in Lemma 11.1.3 (see Example 5.3.1) do not
depend on the homogeneity of the nonlinearity. On the other hand, from (11.5) it
follows that f (x, u)F −1 (x, u) ≥ θ −1 u−1 and hence, integrating,
|F (x, u)| ≥ a|u|1/θ ,

a > 0.

(11.6)

Using again (11.5), we deduce that f is superlinear at infinity and allows us to repeat
the arguments carried out in Example 5.5.1 proving that (J 2) or (J 4) holds.
In conclusion, we can state the following result.
Theorem 11.1.4 If f satisfies (i), (ii) and (iii), then (11.4) has a nontrivial solution.
Moreover, if λ < λ1 , (11.4) has a positive solution.


Remark 11.1.5 Condition (iii) can be further weakened by requiring that it hold
only for all |u| ! 1. The proof requires some minor changes that are left to the
reader.
Remark 11.1.6 Exercises 40 and 41 show that, in general, positive solutions given
by the preceding theorem cannot be obtained by sub- and super-solutions.
Remark 11.1.7 In general, (11.4) has no nontrivial solution u ∈ H 2 () ∩ H01 () if
λ ≤ 0, p ≥ 2∗ − 1 and N > 2. This can be derived as a consequence of an integral
identity for the case f (x, u) = f (u), due to Pohozaev, which states that any solution
of (11.4) verifies

|∇u|2 = f (u)u.

Therefore, if (11.4) has a nontrivial solution, then p + 1 < 2N/(N − 2) = 2∗ .
Remark 11.1.8 In contrast to the previous discussion, if we consider the following
linear perturbation of problem (11.4):
∗

−u = λu + |u|2 −2 u,
u = 0,

x∈
x ∈ ∂,

(11.8)

and N ≥ 4, then (11.8) has a positive solution whenever 0 < λ < λ1 . In the
case N = 3 there exists λ∗ ≥ 0 such that (11.8) has a positive solution whenever
λ∗ < λ < λ1 . Moreover, if  is a ball, necessarily λ∗ > 0.
These and other results dealing with (11.8), including existence of solutions for
λ > λ1 , are out of the scope of this book. For an exposition, we refer, e.g., to [37].

11.2

Superlinear Ambrosetti–Prodi Problem

In this section we study a superlinear version of the Ambrosetti and Prodi problem.
Specifically, we consider the boundary value problem
−u = f (x, u) + tϕ,
u = 0,

x ∈ ,
x ∈ ∂,

(11.9t )

where ϕ ∈ L∞ () is a positive function, and f is a continuous function such that

s

for some ε > 0. In addition, we suppose that there exists h(x) ∈ L∞ () and
1 < p < 2∗ − 1 such that
lim

s→+∞

f (x, s)
= h(x) > c > 0,
sp

uniformly in x ∈ .

(11.11)

Notice that this hypothesis implies that f is superlinear at +∞ and satisfies the
subcritical condition (ii) of the previous section.
Theorem 11.2.1 Let ϕ ∈ L∞ () be a positive function and let f be a continuous
function satisfying (11.10) and (11.11). Then t ∗ , the supremum of all t ∈ R such
that problem (11.9t ) admits a solution, is finite and there exists a continuum C in
 ≡ {(t, u) ∈ R × C01 () : u solution of (11.9t )} satisfying that
1. ( − ∞, t ∗ ] ⊂ ProjR C.
2. For every t ∈ ( − ∞, t ∗ ), the t-slice Ct = {u ∈ C01 () : (t, u) ∈ C} contains two
distinct solutions of (11.9t ).


Remark 11.2.2 Similarly to Remark 10.4.2, we obtain as a corollary that problem
(11.9t ) has, at least, two (respectively, one, zero) solutions for t < t ∗ (respectively,
t ≤ t ∗ , t > t ∗ .).
The proof is essentially equal to the one of Theorem 10.4.1. The only change is the
estimate given by Lemma 10.2.1. In this case, an easy extension of the result by
Gidas and Spruck in [57] gives the following result.
Lemma 11.2.3 Let ϕ ∈ L∞ () be a positive function. Suppose that f satisfies
(11.10) and (11.11). Then the solutions of (11.9t ) are uniformly bounded in compact
sets of t, i.e., for every compact interval  ⊂ R, there exists c ∈ R such that every
solution u of (11.9t ) with t ∈  satisfies

Proof By bootstrap arguments, it is sufficient to prove the existence of an a priori
estimate for the norm in L∞ () of the solutions of (11.9t ) with t in a given compact
interval . The proof is divided into two steps:
Step 1. There exists a positive constant c such that
u(x) > −c, x ∈ ,
for every solution u of (Pt ) with t ∈ .
Step 2. There exists a positive constant C such that
u(x) ≤ C, x ∈ ,
for every solution u of (Pt ) with t ∈ .
Proof of Step 1 In order to prove this a priori bound, we observe that, taking u− ≡
min{u, 0} as a test function in the equation satisfied by u, and by using hypothesis

Applying the previous lemma with (h) := |h |, we deduce the existence of a

Proof of Step 2 Consider the constant c obtained in the first step. It suffices to show
the existence of 

c, for every x ∈ . Since
v = u + c > 0 satisfies
−v = f(x, v) + tϕ,
v = c,

x ∈ ,
x ∈ ∂,

with f(x, s) := f (x, s − c), we follow the outline of [57] where the case c = 0 is
studied. Arguing by contradiction, assume that there exist positive solutions vn ∈
C 1 () of the above problem with λn ∈  and points Pn ∈  such that:
c < Mn = max vn = vn (Pn ) → +∞.

Then, up to a subsequence, we may assume
λn → λ,

Pn → P ∈ .

Two cases can occur: either P ∈  or P ∈ ∂. In both cases, we will obtain a
contradiction.

Taking into account that
wn Ls (BR (0)) + gn Ls (BR (0)) ≤ C1 = C1 (R  , λn ), ∀n ≥ n0 ,
we deduce a uniform bound for wn W 2,s (BR (0)) for every n ≥ n0 . Choosing s large
enough, we obtain from Morrey’s theorem (see Theorem A.4.3) that wn C 1,β (BR (0)) is
uniformly bounded. Therefore we can apply the Ascoli–Arzelà theorem and deduce
the existence of a function w ∈ C(BR (0)) such that, up to a subsequence, wn → w
in C(BR (0)) and h(μn y + Pn ) → ν, for some ν > 0. Necessarily, we have that
w(0) = 1 and, using again (11.14),
−w = νwp ,

y ∈ BR (0).

Then, by regularity, for τ ∈ (0, 1), w ∈ C (BR (0)). From the arbitrariness of R > 0
we deduce that w is defined in RN and it is a solution of

−w(y) = wp (y),

y ∈ RN .

By Theorem 1.2 in [57], w ≡ 0, contradicting that w(0) = 1.
In the second case, P ∈ ∂ and since ∂ is smooth, we can suppose that near P the
boundary of  is contained in the hyperplane xN = 0 and that a neighborhood of P
in  is contained in the set {x ∈ RN : xN > 0}. We set dn = dist(Pn , ∂) = Pn · en ,
(en = (0, . . . , 0, 1)), and we observe that the function wn given by (11.12) is well
defined in n ≡ B δ (0) ∩ {yN > −dn /μn }, for some δ > 0. Moreover, it satisfies
μn
(11.13) in n . By Lp -theory up to the boundary (see Theorem 1.2.11-1) and Morrey’s

necessary, that dn /μn → s > 0. Since wn satisfies (11.13) in n , again by Lp -theory,
for every R, ε > 0, we get a uniform bound of wn in C 1,τ (BR (0) ∩ {yN > −s + ε})
for n large enough. Therefore, we obtain that, up to a subsequence, wn → w in
C 1 (BR (0) ∩ {yN > −s + ε}), h(μn y + Pn ) → ν, for some ν > 0, and using that R

It is worthwhile to observe that the above theorem implies also the existence of
positive solution of (11.4) provided that λ < λ1 .
Corollary 11.2.5 If f is a continuous function in  × [0, +∞) satisfying (i) of the
previous section and (11.11), then problem (11.4) has a positive solution provided
that λ < λ1 .
Remark 11.2.6 Compare this result with the assertion proved in Theorem 11.1.4 for
λ < λ1 .
Proof To prove the corollary, we extend, as usual when we look for positive solutions, the nonlinearity to all  × R by setting f (x, u) = 0 for u < 0. Choosing
ϕ = ϕ1 , we embed the problem (11.4) into the one-parameter family of problems
(11.9t ). Applying Theorem 11.2.1, we deduce the existence of, at least, two solutions
of (11.9t ) for t ≤ t ∗ . The proof will be concluded if we show that t ∗ > 0 because
this implies that (11.90 ), i.e. (11.4) has two solutions: one is the zero one and the
other the positive solution that we are looking for. To prove that t ∗ > 0, it suffices
to observe that, by condition (i) and for t > 0, δϕ1 is a super-solution of (11.9t )
provided that δ > 0 is sufficient small.

Quasilinear Problems

In this chapter we consider a class of quasilinear elliptic problems. In order to handle
this case an improvement of the mountain pass theorem is needed because the Euler
functional fails to be C 1 . This critical point result is discussed in Sect. 12.2 and
is applied to boundary value problems in Sect. 12.3. A nonvariational equation is
also considered in Sect. 12.4, where we apply the global bifurcation theorem (see
Theorem 4.4.1).

12.1

First Results

We study quasilinear Dirichlet problems in a bounded open set  ⊂ RN , where
N ≥ 3 (the case N = 2 is left to the reader (see Exercise 49)). Specifically, we
replace the linear operator  by a quasilinear operator, namely we consider here
operators like Qu = −div (a(x, u)∇u) + g(x, u)|∇u|2 , where a(x, s) and g(x, s) are
continuous functions in  × R satisfying
α ≤ a(x, s) ≤ β,

∀x ∈ ,

∀s ∈ R,

(12.1)

∀s ∈ R.

(12.2)

for positive constants α, β, and
g(x, s)s ≥ 0,

∀x ∈ ,

Observe that Q contains a lower order term with quadratic growth with respect to the
gradient. From the works of Boccardo et al. [33–35] this kind of quasilinear operator
has been extensively studied, especially if the right-hand side is linear. In particular,
among other results, these authors have proved the following one.
Theorem 12.1.1 Assume that a(x, s) and g(x, s) are continuous functions in  × R
satisfying (12.1) and (12.2). If h(x) ∈ Lq () with q > N2 , then the problem
−div (a(x, u)∇u) + g(x, u)|∇u|2 = h(x), x ∈ 
u = 0,
x ∈ ∂
has a solution u ∈ H01 () ∩ C().

When a and g are independent of x ∈ , i.e., a(x, s) = α(s) and g(x, s) = g(s), the
uniqueness of solution is a consequence of the following principle [27].
Theorem 12.1.2 Given a continuous function g : [0, +∞) −→ [0, +∞) and q >
N
, let 0 ≤ h1 , h2 ∈ Lq () be functions such that
2
h1 (x) ≥ h2 (x),

∀x ∈ .

If 0 ≤ u, v ∈ H01 () ∩ L∞ () verify
−div (α(u)∇u) + g(u)|∇u|2 = h1 ,

x∈

−div (α(v)∇v) + g(v)|∇v|2 = h2 ,

x ∈ ,

and
then u ≤ v.
Proof Define γ (s) =

g(t) dt and P (s) =

s

α(t)e−γ (t) dt, for every s > 0. Taking

e−γ (u) [P (u) − P (v)]+ ∈ H01 () ∩ L∞ ()
as a test function in the equation satisfied by u, we obtain

∇u · ∇ e
[P (u) − P (v)] + g(u)|∇u|2 e−γ (u) [P (u) − P (v)]+

= h1 e−γ (u) [P (u) − P (v)]+ .
(12.3)
Using that γ  = g, we have
∇ e−γ (u) [P (u) − P (v)]+ = e−γ (u) ∇ [P (u) − P (v)]+
− g(u)∇u e−γ (u) [P (u) − P (v)]+ .
Hence (12.3) means


e−γ (u) ∇u · ∇ [P (u) − P (v)]+ = h1 e−γ (u) [P (u) − P (v)]+ .
Since ∇P (u) = P  (u)∇u = e−γ (u) ∇u, we can rewrite the above equality as


(12.4)
∇P (u) · ∇ [P (u) − P (v)]+ = h1 e−γ (u) [P (u) − P (v)]+ .
Similarly, taking now e−γ (v) [P (u) − P (v)]+ as a test function in the equation of v,
we deduce that


∇P (v) · ∇ [P (u) − P (v)]+ = h2 e−γ (v) [P (u) − P (v)]+ .
Subtracting this from (12.4) we get from the non-negativeness of h1 − h2


|∇ [P (u) − P (v)]+ |2 ≤ (h1 e−γ (u) − h2 e−γ (v) ) [P (u) − P (v)]+ ≤ 0,
i.e., P (u) ≤ P (v) or equivalently u ≤ v.

Mountain Pass Theorem for Nondifferentiable Functionals
and Applications

The study of quasilinear problems associated to the operator Q of the preceding
section with a superlinear right-hand side requires the extension of the mountain
pass Theorem 11.1.4 to cover the case of functionals which are not differentiable in
all directions.
The proof of the classical mountain pass theorem given in Sect. 5.3 was based on
the deformation lemma (Lemma 5.3.2). A different approach based on the Ekeland
variational principle (Theorem 5.4.2) can be found in [29, 48, 69]. In this section,
we prove the required extension by following the latter strategy. All the ideas used
here are close to those in [19].
Theorem 12.2.1 Let X be a Banach space with a norm ·X and Y ⊂ X a subspace,
which is itself a Banach space endowed with a different norm  · Y . Assume that
J : X −→ R is a functional on X such that J|Y is continuous in (Y ,  · X +  · Y )
and satisfies the following hypotheses:
(a) J has a directional derivative J  (u), v at each u ∈ X through any direction
v ∈ Y.
(b) For fixed u ∈ X, the function J  (u), v is linear in v ∈ Y , and, for fixed v ∈ Y ,
the function J  (u), v is continuous in u ∈ X.

(i) f (x, 0) = fu (x, 0) = 0,
(ii) |f (x, u)| ≤ C1 + C2 |u|p with 1 < p < 2∗ − 1.

a.e. x ∈ ,

hold, then the functional J satisfies the compactness condition (C).
Remark 12.3.2 As in the proof of the (P S)c condition for the semilinear case studied
in Chap. 11 (see Lemma 11.1.1), the outline of the proof consists of two steps. First,
we prove that {un } is bounded and, second, that it possesses a strongly convergent
subsequence in X. We point out that the second step is more tricky in the quasilinear
case (compare it with Lemma 7.1.1).
Proof Let {un } be a sequence in Y satisfying (12.6)–(12.8) for some {Kn } ⊂ (0, +∞)
and {εn } −→ 0. We begin by proving that the sequence {un } is bounded. In order to
do this, following the ideas of Lemma 11.1.1, we choose v = un as a test function in
(12.8) to deduce from (12.7) that
|J  (un ), un | ≤ εn [2 + un X ] .
Moreover, by using (12.6), we infer that
pJ (un ) − J  (un ), un  ≤ C + εn [2 + un X ] .
Hence, the hypothesis (12.16) means that

≤ C + εn [2 + un X ] + [F (x, un ) − θ un f (x, un )] .
Now, the boundedness of {un } follows from (11.5) as in the proof for the problem
(11.4).
In particular, passing to a subsequence if necessary, we can assume that {un } is
weakly converging to some u in H01 (), and, by Theorem A.4.9, strongly converging
in L2 () and dominated by a function h ∈ L2 (), i.e., |un | ≤ h almost everywhere
in .
We are going to prove that the sequence un is strongly convergent in H01 ()
to u. Let us introduce the truncature function Tk and Gk given by Tk (s) =
max{min{s, k}, −k} and Gk (s) = s − Tk (s), for every s ∈ R, and then we proceed
via the following steps.
Step 1. For every fixed k > s0 , the sequence Tk (un ) converges to Tk (u) in H01 ().
Step 2. For each δ > 0 , there exist k0 ≥ s0 and n0 ∈ N such that Gk (un ) < δ for
every k ≥ k0 and n ≥ n0 .

Indeed, using that un = Tk (un ) + Gk (un ), we have
un − u ≤ un − Tk (u) + Tk (u) − u
≤ Tk (un ) − Tk (u) + Gk (un ) + Tk (u) − u
and Steps 1 and 2 show that the last three terms are arbitrarily small provided that k
is sufficiently large, i.e., un converges in H01 () to u.
To prove the first step, we follow [32]. We fix k > s0 and take ϕ ∈ C 1 (R, R) such
that ϕ(0) = 0. We denote wnk := Tk (un ) − Tk (u). It is easy to verify that the sequence
{ϕ(wnk )} is
• weakly converging to zero in H01 (),
• converging to zero almost everywhere in  and
• strongly converging to zero in Lq () for every q ∈ [1, +∞).
Using (12.1) and (12.15), we deduce that if k > s0 , then

Theorem 12.3.3 Assume that the preceding
 conditions (i) and (ii) are satisfied. If,
in addition, there exist s0 > 0, θ ∈ 0, 21 and α0 > 0 such that the inequalities
(11.5), (12.15) and (12.16) hold, then problem (12.14) has at least one nontrivial
solution.
Proof We begin by proving that if E = X = H01 () , then the functional J satisfies
the conditions (J 1) and (J 2) introduced in Sect. 5.3. The verification is divided into
two steps:
Step 1. First we show that u = 0 is a strict local minimum of J . Indeed, by hypotheses
(i) and (ii), we deduce that for fixed ε > 0 there exists Cε > 0 such that
F (x, s) ≤ α1 εs 2 + Cε s p+1 ,
Then F(u) :=



∀s ≥ 0.


F (x, u) = o u2 at u = 0 and, by (12.1), we obtain
J (u) ≥ αu2 − o u2



from which one easily deduce the existence of positive constants ρ, R such that
J (u) ≥ ρ > 0

for u = R > 0

(12.17)

and (J 1) is verified.
Step 2. To verify (J 2), observe that, by (12.1) and (11.5) (which implies (11.6)), we
have for t > 0
β
J (tϕ1 ) ≤ t 2 ϕ1 2 − C4 t 1/θ ϕ1 1/θ + C5 .
2
Thus, there exists t0 > ϕR1  such that J (t0 ϕ1 ) < 0 and condition (J 2) is satisfied.
Now, in order to apply Theorem 12.2.1, take X = H01 () and Y = H01 () ∩
∞
L () endowed with the norm  · Y =  · ∞ +  · , and e = t0 ϕ1 . Moreover, let
 = {γ : [0, 1] −→ (Y ,  · Y ) : γ is continuous and γ (0) = 0,

γ (1) = e} .

Observe that every γ ∈  is continuous from [0, 1] to H01 (), so that, since t0 ϕ1  ≥
2R, there exists t¯ ∈ [0, 1] such that γ (t¯) = R. Thus, by (12.17),
c ≡ inf max J (γ (t)) ≥ ρ > max{J (0), J (t0 ϕ1 )} = 0,
γ ∈ t∈[0,1]

and hypothesis (12.5) holds.
In addition, Lemma 12.3.1 implies that (C) is verified, and Theorem 12.2.1 implies
that there exists u ∈ H01 () ∩ L∞ () such that J (u) = c > 0 and J  (u), v = 0
for every v ∈ H01 () ∩ L∞ ().

12 Quasilinear Problems

Some Nonvariational Quasilinear Problems

We will see now how the topological methods developed in Chaps. 4 and 6 can also
be applied to study quasilinear problems. Specifically, let  be an open and bounded
2N
subset of RN (N ≥ 3), λ ≥ 0, 1 < p < N+2
and 0 ≤ h ∈ L N +2 (). Consider the
N−2
(nonvariational) boundary value problem
−u + g(u)|∇u|2 = λ|u|p−1 u + h(x),
u = 0,

x ∈ ,
x ∈ ∂,

(12.18λ )

for a suitable non-negative continuous function g : [0, +∞) −→ [0, +∞). We look
for positive solutions of (12.18λ ), i.e., u ∈ H01 () such that u > 0 a.e. x ∈ ,
g(u)|∇u|2 ∈ L1 () and



2
p
∇u · ∇ϕ + g(u)|∇u| ϕ = λ u ϕ + hϕ,
(12.19)
for every ϕ ∈ H01 () ∩ L∞ ().
The following lemma concerning the regularity of the solutions will be useful in
the sequel. It can be easily deduced by using the Stampacchia technique [82], as in
the proof of Lemma 11.2.3. The details are left to the reader (see Exercise 50).
Lemma 12.4.1 Assume that h ∈ Lq () with q > N2 . If u ∈ H01 () is a solution for
(12.18λ ), then u belongs to L∞ ().
Now we give sufficient conditions to ensure that problem (12.18λ ) satisfies the
uniform strong maximum principle in compactly embedded domains; that is, for
every ω ⊂⊂  there exists a positive constant (independent from λ) which is a
lower bound in ω of any solution of (12.18λ ).
Proposition 12.4.2 Suppose that 0  h ∈ Lq (), q > N/2. Then for every ω ⊂⊂
 there exists Lω > 0 such that
u(x) ≥ Lω ,

a.e. x ∈ ω,

for every super-solution u ∈ H01 () of (12.18λ ) (with λ any positive constant).
Proof For every s ∈ R, T1 (s) = max{min{s, 1}, −1}. Taking into account that
λs p + h(x) ≥ T1 (h(x)), for all s ≥ 0, every solution u ∈ H01 () is a super-solution
for the problem
−v + g(v)|∇v|2 = T1 (h(x)), x ∈ ,
v = 0,
x ∈ ∂.
By Theorems 12.1.1 and 12.1.2, this problem has a unique continuous solution
v ∈ H01 () ∩ C(). Using that v ∈ C() and v > 0 in , if ω ⊂⊂  we infer the existence of Lω > 0 such that v(x) ≥ minω v = Lω . By the comparison
principle given in Theorem 12.1.2, we deduce that u ≥ v ≥ Lω , and the proof is
concluded.

12.4 Some Nonvariational Quasilinear Problems

143

Observe that with the notation of Sect. 12.1, (12.18λ ) can be rewritten1 as a fixed
point problem, namely,
g
u = Kλ (u),
g

with Kλ (u) = K g (λ, u). The compactness of K g (λ, w) (see Proposition 12.1.3)
allows us to apply the Leray–Schauder degree techniques to study the existence of
“continua of solutions” of (12.18λ ).
Consider the solution set, i.e.,
g

 = {(λ, u) ∈ R × H01 () : u = Kλ (u)}.
We state the existence of solutions by proving the existence of a global continuum
in  which emanates from the unique solution of (12.180 ) and by establishing its
asymptotic behavior. We point out that in the semilinear case (g ≡ 0), given h  0
and p > 1, there exists λ∗ > 0 such that (12.18λ ) has no positive solution for
every λ > λ∗ , i.e., Proj[0,+∞)  is bounded. On the contrary, the quasilinear case is
quite different. Indeed, we give sufficient conditions (see (12.20) below) to ensure
that Proj[0,+∞)  is unbounded. The role of these conditions is to provide for every
compact set  of λ’s the existence of suitable a priori bounds of the H01 ()-norm
of solutions of (12.18λ ) with λ ∈ , i.e., to establish that the λ-slice λ = {u ∈
H01 () : (λ, u) ∈ } is bounded.
Theorem 12.4.3 Consider p ∈ (1, 2∗ − 1), 0  h ∈ Lq (), q > N/2 and assume
that g ≥ 0 is continuous in the interval [0, +∞).
(i) If 1 < p < 2 and, for some constants s1 , c > 0 and 0 ≤ γ < 2 − p, g satisfies
c
(12.20)
g(s) ≥ γ , ∀s ≥ s1 ,
s
then problem (12.18λ ) admits a positive solution for every λ ∈ [0, +∞).

(12.21)

then there exist λ∗ , λ∗ > 0 such that (12.18λ ) admits a positive solution for every
λ ∈ [0, λ∗ ) and admits no positive solution for λ > λ∗ .
Proof First, we prove that there exists an unbounded continuum S ⊂  which
contains (0, u0 ), where u0 is the unique solution of (12.180 ). In order to do this,
we compute the index of the solution u0 ∈ H01 () for (12.180 ) by showing that
g
i(K0 , u0 ) = 1. Indeed, by Theorems 12.1.1 and 12.1.2 let U (t) be the unique solution of
−u + tg(u)|∇u|2 = h(x), x ∈ ,
(12.22)
u = 0,
x ∈ ∂,
1
Compare this approach with the one in the work by Ruiz and Suárez [79], for g ≡ 1 and a logistic
nonlinearity, where the authors combine regularity in C 1 () with the properties of the inverse K
of the Laplacian operator in C() in order to use bifurcation techniques.

12 Quasilinear Problems

and define H : [0, 1] × H01 () → H01 () by setting H (t, w) = U (t) for every
g
(t, w) ∈ [0, 1] × H01 (). Observe that H (1, w) = U (1) = K0 (w) = u0 , while
H (0, w) = U (0) = K(h(x)) and it is well known that i(K(h(x)), U (0)) = 1. By
Proposition 12.1.3 we deduce that H is compact.In addition, using that g ≥ 0, and
taking u as a test function in (12.22), we have |∇u|2 ≤ h u. The Hölder and
Sobolev inequalities with S = sup{u2∗ : u = 1} the Sobolev constant (see
Notation) imply U (t) ≤ Sh2N/(N+2) , for every t ∈ [0, 1]. Hence, choosing
R > Sh2N/(N+2) , we obtain u = H (t, u) for every t ∈ [0, 1] and u ∈ H01 () with
u ≥ R, and we can apply the homotopy invariance of the degree to conclude that
g

i(K0 , u0 ) = i(H (1, ·), U (1)) = i(H (0, ·), U (0))
= i(K(h(x)), U (0)) = 1,
and the claim has been proved. The existence of an unbounded continuum S ⊂ 
follows now from Theorem 4.4.1.
The unboundedness of the continuum S implies that one of the projections of S,
either its projection Proj [0,+∞) S on the λ-axis or its projection Proj H01 () S on the
H01 ()-axis, is an unbounded set. We will see that in case i) the former projection
is unbounded. More precisely, for every compact set  of λ’s, we will show the
existence of suitable a priori bounds of the H01 ()-norm of solutions of (12.18λ )
with λ ∈ . This will imply that the λ-slice Sλ = {u ∈ H01 () : (λ, u) ∈ S} is
bounded. On the other hand, in case ii) it is the later projection which is unbounded
since, as we will see below, there exists λ∗ > 0 such that (12.18λ ) has no positive
solutions for λ > λ∗ . Clearly, this will conclude the proof of the theorem.
(i) Since 1 < p < 2 and (12.20) holds with γ < 2 − p, we may construct a
continuous and non-negative function g0 (s) such that g0 (s) = 0 for every s < s20 ,
g0 (s) = scγ for every s > s0 and g(s) ≥ g0 (s) for every s > 0. We also define the

2. ϕ  (s) + g0 (s)ϕ(s) = 1 for every s ∈ (0, +∞).
3. There exists σ > 0 with g0 (s)ϕ(s) ≤ σ for every s > 0.
Let u ∈ H01 () be a positive solution of (12.18λ ) for some λ > 0. Observe that,
using 3., g0 (u)ϕ(u) ∈ L∞ (), which, by 2., implies that ∇ϕ(u) ∈ L2 (). Taking
into account that, by 1., we have ϕ(u) ≤ u we deduce that ϕ(u) ∈ H01 (). Hence we
can take ϕ(u) as a test function and using that g0 (s) ≤ g(s) we obtain

Since ϕ(s)s −γ is bounded from above near infinity (by 3 and by the construction of
g0 ) and near zero (by the definition of ϕ and γ < 2 − p < 1), there exists C > 0
such that ϕ(s) ≤ Cs γ for every s > 0. Therefore, dividing the previous inequality
by up+γ , setting z = u/u and using the Hölder and Sobolev inequalities we get

Stationary States of Evolution Equations

This final chapter deals with the existence of ground and bound states of nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equations. Semiclassical states are discussed in Sect. 13.2.
Systems of coupled NLS equations are handled in Sects. 13.3 and 13.4.
When dealing with elliptic equations on unbounded domains the main problem
is the (P S) condition. We show how one can bypass this difficulty in a few specific
cases.
However, the study of problems on unbounded domains is out of the scope of
this book. The interested reader is referred, e.g., to [15], which contains several
references.

13.1

Soliton States to Stationary NLS Equations

Elliptic equations on all RN arise as stationary states of evolution equations such as
the time-independent solution of the nonlinear wave equation
utt − u + λu = up .
As a second example, we can consider the NLS equation
−i ψt = ψ + aψ + |ψ|p−1 ψ,

(13.1)

where i denotes the imaginary unit and ψ = ψ(t, x) is complex valued. In (13.1),
the ansatz ψ(t, x) = e−iωt u(x), with u(x) ∈ R, yields for u the equation
−u + λu = |u|p−1 u,

x ∈ RN ,

(13.2)

where λ = a − ω. We will assume that λ > 0 and 1 < p < 2∗ − 1, where 2∗ is given
by (7.3). We look for solutions u > 0 of (13.2) such that u ∈ E := H 1 (RN ). These
solutions verify


u2 < ∞,

|∇u|2 < ∞,

and are called bound states of (13.2). Among the bound states, solutions with minimal
energy have a particular interest. They are called ground states.

13 Stationary States of Evolution Equations

Let u ∈ E be a solution of
−u + u = |u|p−1 u.

(13.3)

A straight calculation shows that
uλ (x) = λ1/(p−1) u(λ1/(p−1) x)

(13.4)

solves (13.2). Therefore in the sequel we will look for solutions of (13.3), which can
be found as critical points of

1
|u|p+1 , u ∈ E,
J (u) = 21 u2 − p+1

where u2 =
|∇u|2 + u2 . With this notation, a ground state of (13.3) is a
solution z > 0 such that
J (z) = min{J (u) : u ∈ E, J  (u) = 0}.
There are several methods that can be used to find a ground state. We will employ
the Nehari natural constraint. Let us introduce the functional

G(u) = (J  (u) | u) = u2 − |u|p+1 ,
and consider the set
N = {u ∈ E \ {0} : G(u) = 0}.
Since, obviously, any positive solution of (13.3) belongs to N , then any z such that
J (z) = min{J (u) : u ∈ N }
is a ground state (see also Lemma 13.1.1). Some of the main features of N are
collected below.
(N.1) ∃ r > 0 such that u ≥ r for all u ∈ N .
Proof From G  (0)[v, v] = 2v2 it follows that ∃ r > 0 such that G(u) > 0 for all
u with 0 < v ≤ r, yielding (N.1).

|u|p+1 = ( 21 − p+1

and (N.1) implies J (u) ≥ ( 21 − p+1
)r 2 .

(N.3) For all u ∈ N it holds that (G  (u) | u) ≤ (1 − p)r 2 < 0.

(N.4) N is a smooth manifold diffeomorphic to the unit sphere S of E.
Proof From (N.3) it follows, in particular, that G  (u) = 0 for all u ∈ N and this
proves that G −1 (0) \ {0} is a smooth manifold (of codimension 1) in E. This and
(N.1) imply that N is also a smooth manifold.
Moreover, for all v ∈ E, v = 0,

G(tv) = 0 if and only if t 2 v2 − t p+1 |v|p+1 . This means that

We are now in position to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 13.1.1 Any critical point of J constrained on N is a critical point of J
on E.
Proof Let z ∈ N be a critical point of J constrained on N , i.e., satisfying
∇N J (z) = 0. By the Lagrange multiplier rule (see also Remark 5.3.5) there exists
μ ∈ R such that J  (z) = μG  (z). Taking the scalar product with z, we find
(J  (z) | z) = μ(G  (z) | z).

(13.7)

From (N.3) it follows that (G  (z) | z) = 0. On the other hand (J  (z) | z) = G(z) = 0
and therefore (13.7) implies that μ = 0, whence J  (z) = μG  (z) = 0.


After these preliminaries, we can prove the existence of a ground state of (13.3).
Theorem 13.1.2 If 1 < p < 2∗ − 1, then (13.3) has a positive ground state U ,
which is radially symmetric.
Proof If N = 1 an elementary phase plane analysis shows that (13.3) has a unique
radially symmetric, radially decreasing ground state U . For example, if p = 3 then
√
2
.
U (x) =
cosh (x)
In the case N ≥ 2 we need to use the functional framework outlined before. From
(N.2), J is bounded from below on N . By the Ekeland variational principle, there
exist sequences uk ∈ N , μk ∈ R such that
J (uk ) → c := inf{J (u) : u ∈ N } > 0,

J  (uk ) − μk G  (uk ) → 0.

(13.8)

13 Stationary States of Evolution Equations

Since we can substitute uk with |uk |, we can assume that uk ≥ 0. Moreover, if uk∗
denotes the Schwarz symmetric function associated to uk ,1 let tk∗ > 0 be such that
tk∗ uk∗ ∈ N . It is well known that uk∗ 2 ≤ uk 2 , while |uk∗ |p+1 = |uk |p+1 . Then
(13.6) yields

From the first expression of (13.8) and (13.5) it follows that ( 21 − p+1

and hence there exists c > 0 such that uk  ≤ c . Without relabeling, we can assume
that uk  u, weakly in E. Since uk are radially symmetric, and the subspace of the
radially symmetric functions in E is compactly embedded in Lp+1 (RN ), N ≥ 2, we
deduce that there exists U ∈ E such that uk → U strongly in Lp+1 (RN ). From the
second expression of (13.8) we get
(J  (uk ) | uk ) − μk (G  (uk ) | uk ) → 0.
Since (J  (uk ) | uk ) = G(uk ) = 0 and (G  (uk ) | uk ) ≤ (1 − p)r 2 < 0, see (N.3), it
1
|u|p+1 , one has J  (uk ) = uk − h (uk )
follows that μk → 0. Setting h(u) = p+1
and therefore the second expression of (13.8) yields uk = h (uk ) − μk G  (uk ) + o(1).
Then we find uk → U ( = h (U )) strongly in E. It follows immediately that U ∈ N ,
J (U ) = c and J  (U ) ⊥ N . Using Lemma 13.1.1, we deduce that U is a nontrivial
solution of (13.3). Since uk are radially symmetric and non-negative, it follows that
U is radially symmetric and U ≥ 0. Finally, from the equation −U + U = U p ,
the fact that U ≡ 0 and the maximum principle, we deduce that U > 0.

Our next result deals with the nonautonomous equation
−u + q(x)u = |u|p−1 u,

u ∈ H 1 (RN ),

(13.9)

where N > 2, 1 < p < 2∗ − 1. We assume that the potential q ∈ C(RN ) satisfies

It is easy to check that E ⊂ H 1 (RN ) ⊂ Lp+1 (RN ) with continuous embedding (see
Exercise 9).
Theorem 13.1.3 If (q1)–(q2) hold then (13.9) has a positive (and a negative)
solution.
Proof It is clear that J has the mountain pass geometry. As usual, we let
c = inf max J (γ (t))
γ ∈ t∈[0,1]

denote the mountain pass value. One has that c > 0. To apply the mountain pass
theorem we should check the (P S) condition. Unfortunately, we cannot carry out the
procedure used in the case of problems on a bounded domain, because the embedding
E ⊂ Lp fails to be compact. In the previous theorem this difficulty has been bypassed
using the fact that the problem was autonomous and this allowed us to work with
radial functions. Here we will use the fact that the potential q satisfies (q2).
First of all, the Ekeland variational principle (Theorem 5.4.2) yields a sequence
un ∈ E such that
J (un ) → c,

J  (un ) → 0.

(13.10)

Standard arguments imply that uE ≤ M. Hence, up to a subsequence, un converges
p+1
weakly in E, and strongly in Lloc (RN ), to some u ∈ E. Moreover, from (13.10) it
follows that
(J  (un )|v)E −→ (J  (u)|v)E .

(13.11)

Then u is a weak (and by regularity, strong) solution of (13.9). Let us show that
u = 0.

Semiclassical States of NLS Equations with Potentials

In order to study the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics, one
introduces a small parameter ε ∈ R and considers the problem
−ε 2 u + V (x)u = up ,

(13.15)

where from this point on 2 < p + 1 < 2∗ . We want to see if (13.15) has a positive
solution for ε ∼ 0, uε which concentrates at some point x ∗ , in the sense that
∀ δ > 0, ∃ ε∗ > 0, R > 0 : uε (x) ≤ δ, ∀ |x − x ∗ | ≤ εR, ε < ε∗ .
These solutions look like a soliton whose energy concentrates at x ∗ and are called
semiclassical states of (13.15). We anticipate that the concentration point x ∗ is a
stationary point of V .
There is a broad literature on the existence of semiclassical states, starting with
the paper by Floer and Weinstein [52]. In addition to solutions concentrating at
a single point, the existence of semiclassical states with many (possibly infinitely
many) peaks has been proved, in dependence of suitable properties of the potential
V and of the nature of its stationary points.
Here we will limit ourselves to discussing a basic result, following [8].
We will suppose that V satisfies
(V 1) 0 < inf RN V (x) < supRN V (x) < +∞,
(V 2) V has a non-degenerate stationary point at x ∗ : there exists α > 0 such that
V (x) − V (x ∗ ) = ±α|x − x ∗ |2 + o(|x − x ∗ |2 ).
Up to a translation we can assume that
x ∗ = 0,

and

V (0) = 1.

To highlight that (13.15) is perturbation in nature it is convenient to perform the
change of variable x  → εx. Then (13.15) becomes
−u + V (εx)u = up ,
or else
−u + u + (V (εx) − 1)u = up .

(13.16)

Clearly, if u is a solution of (13.16) then u(x/ε) is a semiclassical state of (13.15)
concentrating at x ∗ = 0.

156

13 Stationary States of Evolution Equations

We will seek solutions of (13.16) as critical points of the functional
Iε (u) = I(u) + Gε (u),

u ∈ E := H 1 (RN ),


where
1
I(u) = 21 u2 − p+1

|u|p+1



and

(V (εx) − 1)u2 .

Gε (u) = 21

We will find critical points of Iε by means of the perturbation results discussed in
Sect. 5.6. We will keep the notation introduced therein. In particular, we will continue
to consider the case in which Z is one dimensional, with parameter s ∈ R.
Lemma 13.2.1 Assumptions (A1), (A2) and (A3) of Sect. 5.6 are verified.

Moreover, (V 2) yields V (εx) − 1 = α 2 ε 2 x 2 + o(ε2 x 2 ). On the other hand, since z
has an exponential decay at infinity, one finds that x 2 z2 ≤ c1 . As a consequence,
'

and (A1) follows.

To prove (A2) let W be the space z ⊥ and write W = z W  . It is well known
that, for ε = 0,
P I  (z)[z, z] > 0, ∀ s ∈ R.
It follows that there exists c > 0 such that
P Iε (z)[z, z] ≥ c,

ε ∼ 0.

Moreover, it is easy to see that, taking c possibly different,
P Iε (z)[v, v] ≤ −c,

∀ v ∈ W ,

ε ∼ 0.

Then P Iε (z) is invertible, provided ε is sufficiently small and (A2) holds.
Finally the proof of (A3) is trivial.

Remark 13.2.2 Since wε  ≤ c1 Gε (z), (13.17) implies that wε  = O(ε2 ).
We are now in position to state the following result, which follows immediately from
the preceding lemmas and from the perturbation Theorem 5.6.5.
Theorem 13.2.3 Let (V 1)–(V 2) hold. Then for ε small, (13.15) has a semiclassical
state which concentrates at x ∗ .

13.2 Semiclassical States of NLS Equations with Potentials

157

Proof In order to apply the perturbation Theorem 5.6.5, it remains to show that the
reduced functional

Iε (s) = Iε (z(s) + wε (s)), s ∈ R
has a stationary point sε∗ . One has
Iε (z(s) + wε (s)) = I(z(s) + wε (s)) + Gε (z(s) + wε (s))

2
1
= I(z(s)) + O(wε (s) ) + 2 (V (εx) − 1)(z(s) + wε (s))2 .
Let us remark that z(s) = U ( · −s) and then I(z(s)) = c0 . Moreover, using
Remark 13.2.2, we infer

1
Iε (z(s) + wε (s)) = c0 + 2 (V (εx) − 1)z2 (s) + o(ε 2 ).
Finally, (V 2) implies



(V (εx) − 1)z (s) = ±αε
2

Since U is an even function,



2


x U (x − s) = ±αε
2

2

2

(y + s)2 U 2 (y)dy.

ysU (y)dy = 0 and thus

(V (εx) − 1)z2 (s) = ±α c1 ε 2 s 2 + c2 ,
where


c1 = 21


2

U (y)dy,

c2 = 21

y 2 U 2 (y)dy.

In conclusion we find that

Iε (s) = Iε (z(s) + wε (s)) = c3 ± α c1 ε 2 s 2 + o(ε 2 ).
Hence the reduced functional 
Iε has a stationary point sε∗ such that sε∗ → 0 as ε → 0.
The result now follows from Theorem 5.6.5.

Remark 13.2.4 In the case discussed above the presence of a perturbation like Gε (u)
does not allow us to use the implicit function theorem to solve the auxiliary equation
as in the case εG(u). Actually, P Iε could fail to be C 1 , because Gε (u) might not
tend to zero as ε → 0. The difficulty is overcome by using (A1)–(A3). A specific
example is reported in Exercise 51.
Remark 13.2.5 There is a great deal of work on problems like (13.15) under several
different assumptions on the potential V . For instance, different approaches to find
semiclassical states can be found in [45] or [86].

13 Stationary States of Evolution Equations

Systems of NLS Equations

In this section we will study a system of linearly coupled NLS equations, such as


−u + u = u3 + λv,
−v + v = v3 + λu,

x ∈ R,
x ∈ R.

(13.18)

These systems typically arise in nonlinear optics. We follow [7].
First of all, in addition to the trivial solution (0, 0), there are two families of
nontrivial solution pairs. First, if we look for solutions such that u = v, we find the
equation
−u + (1 − λ)u = u3 ,
whose solution is
U1−λ (x) =

√
2(1 − λ)
,
√
cosh ( (1 − λ)x)

0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.

(13.19)

On the other hand, if we look for solutions such that u = −v, we find
−u + (1 + λ)u = u3 ,
whose solution is
U1+λ (x) =

√
2(1 + λ)
,
√
cosh ( (1 + λ)x)

λ ≥ 0.

Hence (13.18) has the following two families of nontrivial solutions:
• (U1−λ , U1−λ ), 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 (symmetric states);
• (U1+λ , −U1+λ ), λ ≥ 0 (anti-symmetric states).
We now look for solutions of (13.18) different from the symmetric and antisymmetric states. Let us start with the case in which the parameter λ > 0 is small.
We set
•
•
•
•

X = {u ∈ C 2 (R) : u(x) = u(−x), lim|x|→∞ u(x) = 0},
X = X × X,
Y = {u ∈ C(R) : u(x) = u(−x)},
Y = Y × Y.

Let us point out that for λ = 0, (13.18) has the following nontrivial solutions: (U , 0),
(0, U ), (U , ±U ).
Theorem 13.3.1 From each (U , 0), (0, U ), (U , ±U ) there branches off, for λ > 0
small enough, a unique curve (uλ , vλ ) ∈ X of solutions of (13.18), such that uλ ≡ 0,
vλ ≡ 0.

13.3 Systems of NLS Equations

Proof Consider the map F : R × X → Y
F (λ; u, v) = (−u + u − u3 − λv, −v + v − v3 − λu).
In order to apply the implicit function theorem at λ = 0, (u, v) = (U , 0), let us
consider the partial derivative d(u,v) F (0; U , 0),
d(u,v) F (0; U , 0)[u, v] = (−u + u − 3U 2 u, −v + v)
and the equation d(u,v) F (0; U , 0)[u, v] = (h, k) ∈ Y, namely the decoupled system
 
−u + u − 3U 2 u = h,
−v + v = k.
We claim that it has a unique solution. This is trivially true for the latter equation. As
for the former, we first remark that u = U  is a nontrivial solution of the linearized
equation
−u + u − 3U 2 u = 0,
and the only one satisfying lim|x|→∞ u(x) = 0 (see Appendix 13.5 at the end of this
chapter). Since U  is an odd function, the equation −u + u − 3U 2 u = 0, u ∈ X,
has only the trivial solution, and the claim follows.
The same arguments hold for the derivative
d(u,v) F (0; U , ±U )[u, v] = (−u + u − 3U 2 u, −v + v − 3U 2 v).
These arguments allow us to apply the implicit function Theorem 3.2.1 to F (λ; u, v) =
0, and the existence of the families (uλ , vλ ) follows. Of course, none of the components can be identically zero because if λ > 0, (13.18) has no solution of the form
(u, 0) or (0, v).


Next, we look for secondary bifurcations from the family of symmetric states
(U1−λ , U1−λ ). We will use Theorem 6.1.3, concerned with the bifurcation from the
simple eigenvalue. For this, we change the variable, setting
w = (w1 , w2 ),

w1 = u − U1−λ ,

w2 = v − U1−λ ,

and consider the map
F(λ; w) = F (λ, w1 + U1−λ , w2 + U1−λ ),
in such a way that (we set 0 = (0, 0))
F(λ; 0) = F (λ, U1−λ , U1−λ ) ≡ 0.
We need to study the operator
Tλ := dw F(λ; 0) = d(u,v) F (λ; U1−λ , U1−λ ) ∈ L(X, Y).

160

13 Stationary States of Evolution Equations

Let us start with Ker [Tλ ] and consider the linearized system Tλ [u, v] = (0, 0):


u − λv = 0,
−u + u − 3U1−λ

2

2
−ψ  + (1 + λ)ψ − 3U1−λ

(13.21)

Since (13.21) is decoupled, we can study the two equations separately. As before,

, which does not belong to
the unique nontrivial solution of the first equation is U1−λ
X, whence φ = 0. Let us now consider the second equation in (13.21). It is of the
type (13.30) discussed in the first item of Appendix 13.5, namely
−ψ  + Qλ (x)ψ = 0,
with
2
,
Qλ (x) = 1 + λ − 3U1−λ

and
bλ = lim Qλ (x) = 1 + λ.
|x|→∞

Let us denote by Aλ the operator
Aλ (ψ) := −ψ  + Qλ (x)ψ,

ψ ∈ H 1 (R).

Lemma 13.3.2 For λ ∈ [0, 1) the first two eigenvalues ν1 (λ) < ν2 (λ) of Aλ are
given by:
(a) ν1 (λ) = 5λ − 3,
(b) ν2 (λ) = 2λ.
Proof Let us compute Aλ (fλ ) with
fλ (x) :=

1
√
cosh ( 1 − λ x)
2

With this notation, one has Qλ (x) = 1 + λ − 6(1 − λ)fλ . Since
√
fλ = −2(1 − λ)fλ + 6(1 − λ) sinh2 ( 1 − λ x)fλ2 ,

13.3 Systems of NLS Equations

161

and Qλ fλ = (1+λ)fλ −6(1−λ)fλ2 , we find (the dependence of f on λ is understood)
√
Aλ (f ) = (3 − λ)f − 6(1 − λ) sinh2 ( 1 − λ x)f 2 − 6(1 − λ)f 2
√
= (3 − λ)f − 6(1 − λ)( sinh2 ( 1 − λ x) + 1)f 2
√
= (3 − λ)f − 6(1 − λ) cosh2 ( 1 − λ x)f 2
= (3 − λ)f − 6(1 − λ)f = (5λ − 3)f.
Since fλ > 0, it follows (see Appendix 13.5-(1)) that 5λ − 3 is the first eigenvalue
of Aλ , proving (a).

and remark that
Next, let us set gλ = U1−λ
2
−gλ + (1 − λ)gλ − 3U1−λ
gλ = 0.

Then one finds:
2
Aλ (gλ ) = −gλ + (1 + λ)gλ − 3U1−λ
gλ = 2λgλ .

Since gλ has a single zero, it follows that 2λ is the second eigenvalue of Aλ , proving
(b). Let us point out that ν1 (λ) < ν2 (λ) < bλ provided λ < 1.


From the previous lemma we deduce the following.
Lemma 13.3.3 (i) For all λ ∈ [0, 1), λ = 3/5, the operator Tλ is invertible.
(ii) For λ = 3/5, Ker [Tλ ] is one dimensional and spanned by ϕ ∗ = (f ∗ , f ∗ ), where
f ∗ = f3/5 . Moreover, the Range[Tλ ] equals the subspace Y0 ⊂ Y,


Y0 = {(h, k) ∈ Y : hf ∗ = kf ∗ = 0}.
Proof (i-1) For 0 ≤ λ < 3/5, resp. 3/5 < λ < 1, one has that ν1 (λ) < 0 < ν2 (λ),
resp. ν1 (λ) > 0, and therefore Ker [Aλ ] = {0}. Then the solution of (13.21) is given
by φ = 0, ψ = 0. Since
u = 21 (φ + ψ),
(13.22)
v = 21 (φ − ψ),
it follows that (13.20) has only the trivial solution (0, 0), proving that Ker [Tλ ] =
{(0, 0)} for λ ∈ [0, 3/5) ∪ (3/5, 1).
(i-2) To show that the system Tλ [u, v] = (h, k) has a unique solution for any
(h, k) ∈ Y and for λ ∈ [0, 3/5) ∪ (3/5, 1), it suffices to pass to the decoupled system
2
−φ  + (1 − λ)φ − 3U1−λ
φ = h + k,
2
−ψ  + (1 + λ)ψ − 3U1−λ
ψ = h − k,

which has a unique solution. From (i-1)–(i-2) it follows that (i) holds.

(13.23)

162

13 Stationary States of Evolution Equations

(ii) For λ = 3/5, Lemma 13.3.2 implies that Ker [Aλ ] is spanned by f ∗ . Using
again (13.22), it follows that Ker [Tλ ], λ = 3/5, is spanned by ϕ ∗ = (f ∗ , f ∗ ).
Moreover, arguing as before, the system Tλ [u, v] = (h, k) is equivalent to (13.23),
which has, for λ = 3/5, a unique solution, provided

(13.24)
(h − k)f ∗ = 0.
Furthermore, multiplying the system Tλ [u, v] = (h, k) by f ∗ and integrating by parts,
it follows that

Theorem 13.3.4 For λ∗ = 3/5 there is a branching of solutions (uλ , vλ ) ∈ X of
(13.18) from the family of symmetric states (U1−λ , U1−λ ), and it is the only one (see
Fig. 13.1).

Proof As anticipated before, we will use Theorem 6.1.3. Lemma 13.3.3-(ii) shows
that assumptions (F.1) and (F.2) of Sect. 6.1 hold, with μ = λ∗ and ϕ = ϕ ∗ . As for
condition (F.3), let us evaluate the mixed derivative

dλ,w F(λ, 0)[u, v] = (−3dλ U1−λ

(13.25)

In the Appendix 13.5-(2) it is proved that
dλ,w F(λ∗ , 0)[u, v] = (h∗ , h∗ ),
for some h∗ ∈ Y such that



h∗ f ∗ < 0.

(13.26)

It follows that dλ,w F(λ∗ , 0)[ϕ ∗ ] ∈ Y0 , namely that (F.3) holds. Then an application
of Theorem 6.1.3 implies that λ = λ∗ is a bifurcation point.
Moreover, Lemma 13.3.3-(i) implies that any λ ∈ (0, 1), λ = 3/5, cannot be a
bifurcation point.


Remark 13.3.5 System (13.18) has other solutions, different in nature from the ones
found before. For example, the authors have proved in [12] the existence, for λ = ε
small, of solutions (uε , vε ) such that, as ε → 0,
uε (x) ∼ U (x + ξε ) + U (x − ξε ),

vε (x) ∼ −U (x),

where ξε ∼ log (1/ε). The authors suspect that these solutions can be continued for
λ ∈ [0, 1) and will converge, as λ → 1 to the anti-symmetric pair (U2 , −U2 ). Let
us mention that [12] also deals with the PDE counterpart of (13.18) in dimension
n = 2, 3. In such a case it is proved that there exist solutions whose first component
has many bumps located near the vertices of any regular polygon with less than six
sides, resp. any regular polyhedra but the dodecahedron, in dimension n = 2, resp.
n = 3.
Remark 13.3.6 There is a numerical evidence that a secondary bifurcation branches
off at λ = 1 from the anti-symmetric states (U1+λ , −U1+λ ). However, we do not
know a rigorous proof of this result.
Remark 13.3.7 For other results dealing with nonlinearly coupled NLS equations
we refer to [11].

some c > 0, proving (A1).
Condition (A3) is also easily verified. To prove that (A2) holds we will show that

λ = inf
[(u )2 + Qλ (x)u2 ] : u2 = 1 = 5λ − 3.
Since for λ > 35 one has that λ > 0, it follows that λ = 0 is not an eigenvalue of
(13.30). Therefore ψ = 0 provided 35 < λ < 1.
We next deal with the case 0 < λ < 35 . In this case, by Lemma 13.3.2, it holds
that 5λ − 3 < 0 < 2λ with 2λ is the second eigenvalue (and 5λ − 3 the first one) of
(13.30). Thus λ = 0 is not an eigenvalue of (13.30), proving that ψ = 0.
From w1 = w2 , we find that w2 satisfies

we search u = (u1 , u2 ), v = (v1 , v2 ) ∈ W × W such that Iλ (z)[u, v] = (h|v) for all

Sobolev spaces. The reader can found the details of the proofs in [1, 36, 58, 61,
88]. We assume throughout the appendix that  is an open set in RN , k is a positive
integer and 1 ≤ p ≤ +∞.

A.1 Weak Derivative
In this section we introduce the notion of the weak derivative and its main properties.
As a motivation of the weak differentiation, we suggest applying integration by parts
(or the divergence theorem) to deduce the following characterization.
Proposition A.1.1 If u ∈ C 1 () and vi ∈ C(), for i = 1, 2, . . . , N , then the
following assertions are equivalent:
∂u
1. vi = ∂x
.


∂ϕ
2.
ϕ(x)vi (x)dx = − u(x)
(x)dx, ∀ϕ ∈ C0∞ ().

Definition A.1.2 If u ∈ L1loc () and α = (α1 , α2 , ..., αN ) is a multi-index, we say
that u is weakly α-derivable if there exists a function vα ∈ L1loc () such that


|α|
ϕ(x)vα (x)dx = (−1)
u(x)D α ϕ(x)dx, ∀ϕ ∈ C0∞ ().
Clearly, if such a function vα exists, then it is unique (up to subsets of  with zero
measure). This unique function vα is called the weak α-derivative of u, and it will be
denoted by vα = D α u.
Taking into account that C k () is the subspace of C() which contains all continuous
functions u ∈ C() whose (classical) α-derivatives with order |α| ≤ k also belong to
C(), we can construct a similar space W k () for the weak derivative. Specifically,
we denote by W k () the set of all functions u ∈ L1loc () which are weakly αderivable for every multi-index α with order |α| ≤ k. Clearly, by Proposition A.1.1,
C k () ⊂ W k ().

Appendix A

Since the weak derivative is linear, i.e.,
D α (u + v) = D α u + D α v, D α (λu) = λD α u
for every weakly α-derivable functions u and v, and λ ∈ R, W k () is a linear
subspace of L1loc ().
We recommend that the reader practice the above definition by verifying the next
examples.
Example A.1.3 1. If  = (−1, 1) ⊂ R and u :  → R is the modulus function in
, i.e., u(x) = |x|, for every x ∈ , then u ∈ W 1 () − C 1 ().
2. Let  = (−1, 1) ⊂ R and u :  → R be the sign function in , i.e.,
⎧
⎨ 1,
0,
u(x) =
⎩
−1,

0<x<1
x=0
−1 < x < 0,

then u ∈ W 1 ().
3. Take  = B(0, R), the ball centered at zero with radius R, and u :  → R a
function satisfying u(x) = f ( |x| ), ∀x ∈  \ {0} with f ∈ C 1 ((0, R)). If we have
lim r N−1 f (r) = 0,

r→0+

then
u ∈ W 1 () ⇐⇒ D α u ∈ L1loc (),

∀ | α |≤ 1.

Using this result, we can prove that the following functions:
⎧
1

4. Consider  = (0, 1) × ( − 1, 1), 1 = (0, 1) × (0, 1), 2 = (0, 1) × ( − 1, 0) and
the function u :  → R defined by
⎧
⎨0, y ≤ 0,
u(x, y) =
⎩
1, y > 0.
Then u ∈ W 1 (), but u|1 ∪2 ∈ W 1 (1 ∪ 2 ).
Note also that if α and β are multi-indices and u ∈ L1loc () is a weakly β-derivable
function with β-derivative D β u which is α-derivable in turn, then u is weakly (α+β)derivable with D α+β u = D α (D β u)).1 This implies that one of the main properties of
the spaces W k () is their inductive character; i.e., we can obtain W k () (k ∈ N\{1})
as the functions of W k−1 () whose derivatives of order m−1 belong to W 1 ().
Another remarkable property is that the weak derivative is a local concept.
Proposition A.1.4 If u ∈ L1loc (), then the following assertions are equivalent:
(i) u ∈ W k ().
(ii) For every x ∈  there exists an open neighborhood V = V (x) of x in  such
that u|V ∈ W k (V ).
The functions of W k () can be approximated by functions C0∞ (RN ). To do this, we
consider 0 ≤ ρ ∈ C0∞ (RN ) such that its support verifies
supp ρ ⊂ B(0, 1)
and


RN

ρ(x)dx = 1.

We define for h > 0 and u ∈ L1loc () the set (h) = {x ∈  : h < dist (x, ∂)}
and the function uh ∈ C ∞ ((h)) by setting

 
x−y

ρ
u(y)dy,
uh (x) = N
h
h
for every x ∈ (h). For u ∈ L1loc (), it holds that
(h→0+ )

{uh } −→ u in L1loc ().
If, in addition, u is weakly α-derivable (with α a multi-index), then we have D α u ∈
L1loc () and we can consider (D α u)h ∈ C ∞ ((h)). On the other hand, since uh ∈
C ∞ ((h)) we can compute its derivative D α (u)h in (h). The theorem of derivation
under the integral sign shows that both functions are the same, i.e.,
D α uh (x) = (D α u)h (x), ∀x ∈ (h).
As a consequence we deduce the following characterization of the weak derivative.
1

In general, D α+β u may exists without D β u existing. Indeed, consider the function in Example 4
with α = (1, 0) and β = (0, 1).

Appendix A

Theorem A.1.5 If u, v ∈ L1loc () and α is a multi-index, then the following assertions
are equivalent:
(i) v = D α u.
(ii) There exists a sequence {φn } ⊂ C0∞ (RN ) such that
{φn } −→ u in L1loc (),
{D α φn } −→ v in L1loc ().
It is worthwhile to observe that if u ∈ Lp () for 1 ≤ p < +∞, then it is possible to
define uh in all RN as being uh ∈ C ∞ (RN ) and
(h→0+ )

{uh } −→ u in Lp ().
Using this in conjunction with the previous theorem, we obtain the following.
p

Corollary A.1.6 If u ∈ Lp (), v ∈ Lloc () with 1 ≤ p < +∞ and α a multi-index,
then the following assertions are equivalent:
(i) v = D α u.
(ii) There exists a sequence {φn } ⊂ C0∞ (RN ) such that
{φn } −→ u in Lp (),
p

{D α φn } −→ v in Lloc ().
Theorem A.1.5 also gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the classical derivability of a weakly derivable function. (Remember that every (classically) derivable
function is also weakly derivable, i.e., C 1 () ⊂ W 1 ()).
Corollary A.1.7 If u ∈ W 1 () satisfies
∂u
∈ C() ∀i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N },
∂xi
then u ∈ C 1 ().
∂u
Of course, by ∂x
∈ C() we mean that there exists a continuous function in the
i
∂u
equivalence class of ∂x
∈ L1loc (). Similarly, the condition u ∈ C 1 () means also
i
that in the equivalence class of u ∈ L1loc () there exists a function of class C 1 in .
In turn, a consequence of the previous corollary is the following one.

Corollary A.1.8 If  ⊂ RN is open and connected and u ∈ W 1 () satisfies ∇u = 0
(a.e. x ∈ ), then u is constant.
The weak derivative can also be characterized using absolutely continuous functions.
Observe that for the local character of the weak derivative it suffices to suppose that
 ⊂ RN is a rectangle  = (a1 , b1 ) × (a2 , b2 ) × · · · × (aN , bN ). If i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N },
i := (a1 , b1 ) × (a2 , b2 ) × . . . (ai−1 , bi−1 ) × (ai+1 , bi+1 ) × · · · × (aN , bN ).
we take 

We denote by ACi () the set of all measurable functions u :  → R such that the

Theorem A.1.9 If  = (a1 , b1 ) × (a2 , b2 ) × · · · × (aN , bN ) and u ∈ L1loc (), then

ui is absolutely continuous for almost everywhere
all line segments in  parallel to the coordinate axis and whose partial derivative
with respect to xi is locally integrable in . Functions satisfying this property were
already studied by Beppo Levi and, subsequently, by Leonida Tonelli.
Some consequences of the above characterization are the following.

W 1 ().

Appendix A

Next we study whether the product of two weakly derivable functions is weakly
derivable. Clearly, the answer is no in general. Indeed, if we consider  = B(0, 1) ⊂
RN , α, β ∈ R satisfying
max{1 + α, 1 + β} < N ≤ 1 + α + β
and u(x) = |x|1α , v(x) = |x|1β , then u, v ∈ W 1 (), but uv ∈ W 1 ().
However, taking into account that the product of absolutely continuous functions
is absolutely continuous, it is possible to prove the following result.
Corollary A.1.11 If u, v ∈ W 1 (), then the following assertions are equivalent:
∂v
∂u
(i) u · v ∈ W 1 () with ∂x∂ i (uv) = u ∂x

A particular case in which (ii) (and thus (i)) holds is u, v ∈ W 1 () ∩ L∞ ().
In the sequel we also study the chain rule for the weak derivative. As before for
the product, we first see an example proving that it is not true in general. Indeed, if
 = B(0, 1) ⊂ RN , u(x) = |x|1α with 1 + α < N ≤ 1 + 2α and f (t) = t 2 , ∀t ∈ R,
then f ∈ C 1 (R) ⊂ W 1 (R) and u ∈ W 1 () but f ◦ u ∈ W 1 ().
Since the composition of a Lipschitz function with an absolutely continuous
function is absolutely continuous, the following consequence can be proved.
Corollary A.1.12 Let f : R → R be a Lipschitz function and u ∈ W 1 (). Consider
A = {t ∈ R : ∃f  (t)}3 and define the function g : R → R by
⎧ 
⎨f (t), t ∈ A,
(A.4)
g(t) =
⎩
0,
t ∈ R \ A.
Then, the composition f ◦ u ∈ W 1 () with

∂u
(f ◦ u)(x) = g(u(x))

∂xi
∂xi
for every i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N }.
We remark that all the hypotheses of the above result are satisfied provided that
f ∈ C 1 (R) with bounded derivative.
As an application we obtain the weak derivative of the functions u+ = max{u, 0},
−
u = min{u, 0} and |u| provided that u ∈ W 1 ().

The fundamental theorem of the calculus implies that the measure of R \ A is zero.

Corollary A.1.13 If u ∈ W 1 (), then u+ , u− , |u| ∈ W 1 () with

a.e. x ∈ ,

In particular,

for every a ∈ R.
The second part of the previous corollary is usually attributed to G. Stampacchia (83)
(see also [72, Theorem 3.2.2, p. 69]).

A.2

Sobolev Spaces

In addition to considering an open set  in RN and k ∈ N, we take p ∈ [1, +∞].
Definition A.2.1 The Sobolev space W k,p () is defined as


W k,p () = u ∈ W k () : D α u ∈ Lp (), ∀ |α| ≤ k .

Clearly, W k,p () is a linear subspace of Lp (), ·p . We can consider two
equivalent norms in W k,p ():
⎧
1/p
⎨ |α|≤k D α upp
if p ∈ [1, +∞),
uk,p ≡
⎩
if p = +∞,
max|α|≤k D α u∞
and
|||u|||k,p ≡

D α up .
|α|≤k

In particular, if p = 2 the norm ·k,2 of the space H k () ≡ W k,2 () is the one
associated to the inner product
(u, v)k,2 =

(D α u, D α v)L2 () .
|α|≤k

We have to note that from a historical point of view, the introduction of these spaces
was not motivated by the similarity with C k () that we have used in Sect. 1.1.

Appendix A

J. Schauder had already studied the Cauchy problem associated to quasilinear equations of hyperbolic type by applying the theory of fixed points. In order to do this,
he considered the space E of the functions u of class C k in an open  ⊂ RN such
that all of its partial derivatives D α u up to order k belong to L2 (), and he equipped
this space with the norm ·k,2 . Unfortunately, this space E is not complete with this
norm. Just after, Sobolev considered the functions u ∈ L2 () with weak derivatives
D α u in L2 () for |α| ≤ k. This space with the norm ·k,2 is already complete.
Theorem A.2.2 The Sobolev space W k,p () is a Banach space for 1 ≤ p ≤ +∞.
In addition,
(i) W k,p () is reflexive for 1 < p < +∞,
(ii) W k,p () is separable for 1 ≤ p < +∞.
In particular, H k () is a separable Hilbert space.
Now it is easy to deduce from Corollaries A.1.11 and A.1.12 the following versions
for the product and chain rule in the Sobolev space W k,p ().
Proposition A.2.3 Let p, q, r ∈ [1, +∞] be such that4

Proposition A.2.4 Assume
that u ∈ W1,p () and f : R → R is a Lipschitz function.

Consider the set A = t ∈ R : ∃f  (t) and the function g : R → R given by (A.4).
If f ◦ u ∈ Lp (), then f ◦ u ∈ W 1,p () with

A sufficient condition to obtain that f ◦ u ∈ L () is that either f (0) = 0 or  is
bounded.
It is clear that every function in C k () such that its partial derivatives up to order
k are also in Lp () belongs to W k,p (). The next result shows that this class of
functions is dense in W k,p () provided that 1 ≤ p < +∞.

The above result is not true for p = +∞. Indeed, the modulus function u(x) = |x|
in ( − 1, 1) belongs to W 1,∞ (−1, 1) with
⎧
⎨ 1, x ≥ 0;
u (x) =
⎩
−1, x < 0.
Since the derivative cannot be approximated in the norm ·∞ by continuous
functions, we deduce that u does not belong to the closure of the subspace
W 1,∞ ( − 1, 1) ∩ C 1 ( − 1, 1) in W 1,∞ (−1, 1).

Boundary Values in Sobolev Spaces

Definition A.3.1 We denote by W0 () the closure of C0∞ () in the space W k,p ().

addition,

(i) W0 () is reflexive provided that 1 < p < +∞.

(ii) W0 () is separable provided that 1 ≤ p < +∞.
In particular, H0k () is a separable Hilbert space.
Remark A.3.3 The reader can verify the following assertions.

1. If 1 ≤ p ≤ +∞ and u ∈ W k,p () has compact support in , then u ∈ W0 ().

If we analyze carefully the properties of Sobolev space W0 () we see that all of
them are similar to the ones satisfied by the space of the functions in C 1 () which
vanish on the boundary ∂. The next result strengthens this idea.

Using the space W0 (), we can define an ordering between values on the boundary
of functions in W k,p ().
Definition A.3.6 If 1 ≤ p < +∞ and u, v ∈ W 1,p (), we say
1,p
(i) u ≤ k on ∂ ⇐⇒ (u − k)+ = max {u − k, 0} ∈ W0 ().
(ii) u ≥ k on ∂ ⇐⇒ −u ≤ −k on ∂.
(iii) u ≤ v on ∂ ⇐⇒ u − v ≤ 0 on ∂.
(iv) u ≥ v on ∂ ⇐⇒ v⎧≤ u on ∂.
⎨u ≤ v on ∂
(v) u = v on ∂ ⇐⇒
⎩
v ≤ u on ∂.

Remark A.3.7 1. If  has infinite measure, then every nonzero constant does not
belong to W 1,p () and hence the definition given in case (iii) does not cover to
the one given in (i).
2. The relation defined in (iii) is an order relation in W 1,p () (if we understand by
equality on ∂ that given in (v)).
1,p

By using the chain rule a characterization of W0 () as the functions in W 1,p ()
which vanish on ∂ can be deduced.
Proposition A.3.8 If 1 ≤ p < +∞ and u ∈ W 1,p (), then
1,p

u ∈ W0 () ⇐⇒ u = 0 on ∂.
Applying Theorem A.3.4, we obtain the next connection between weak inequality
on ∂ and the classical one.
Proposition A.3.9 If  ⊂ RN is open, p ∈ [1, +∞) and u ∈ W 1,p () ∩ C(), we
have:
(i) If u(x) ≤ 0, ∀x ∈ ∂, then u ≤ 0 on ∂.
(ii) Conversely, if ∂ is piecewise of class C 1 and u ≤ 0 on ∂, then u(x) ≤ 0 for
every x ∈ ∂.
The case (ii) of the above proposition is false if the boundary ∂ of  is not smooth.

Indeed, it suffices to have in mind that W0 (B(0, 1)\{0}) = W0 (B(0, 1)), provided

The proposition also fails if we replace theconstant 0 by a nonzero constant.
Indeed, taking N ≥ 5,  = x ∈ RN : |x| > 1 and

, ∀x ∈ ,
| x |N−2

we have u ∈ C 2 () ∩ H 1 () and
u(x) = −1, ∀x ∈ ∂,
but it is not true that u ≤ −1 on ∂.
k,p

Proposition A.3.10 If p ∈ [1, +∞), then W0 (RN ) = W k,p (RN ).
Remark A.3.11 1. The above result is false for the case p = ∞. For example, if 
is unbounded in RN , then every nonzero constant belongs to W k,∞ () and it is
not in W0k,∞ (). Thus, W0k,∞ ()  W k,∞ () in this case.
2. As a consequence of the proposition, we have u ≤ v on ∂RN , for every u, v ∈
W 1,p (RN ).

To conclude the summary of properties of W0 () we give the Poincaré inequality.
Proposition A.3.12 If p ∈ [1, +∞) and  ⊂ RN is open and bounded in one
direction, then there exists a positive constant C depending uniquely on  such that
Cup ≤ ∇up ,

1,p

∀u ∈ W0 ().

One of the main consequences of the Poincaré inequality is that, under its hypotheses,
1,p
∇up defines a norm W0 () which is equivalent to ·1,p . In addition, in
 the case
p = 2, this new norm ∇u2 in H01 () is associated to the inner product ∇u · ∇v
for u, v ∈ H 1 ().

Embedding Theorems

We now study the well-known Sobolev and Rellich–Kondrachov embedding theorems. Some words are in order to precisely state the meaning of embedding and
compact embedding.
Definition A.4.1 Let (X,  · X ) and (Y ,  · Y ) be normed spaces.
(i) We say that the space X is embedded in the space Y , and we denote it by X → Y ,
if there exists an injective linear and continuous operator from X into Y . In this
case, the operator is called an embedding.
(ii) We say that the space X is compactly embedded in the space Y , and we denote
it by X⊂→Y , if there exists an embedding of X in Y which is compact.
Here, we shall consider embeddings of W k,p () into three classes of spaces:

W j ,q () with 0 ≤ .j ≤ k (W 0,q/ () ≡ Lq ()) and q denotes the conjugate
exponent of p, i.e., q1 + p1 = 1 .
j

(ii) CB (), for j ∈ N∪{0}, i.e., the space of functions with continuous and bounded
partial derivatives up to order j . This is a Banach space with the following norm:
uC j () = max sup |Dα u(x)|

(iii) CB,u (), i.e., the space of functions with bounded and uniformly continuous
partial derivatives up to order j in  and such that the partial derivatives of
order j satisfy a Hölder condition with exponent ν ∈ (0, 1). It is also a Banach
space with the norm

for every u ∈ CB,u (). Clearly, CB,u () ⊂ CB ().
The embedding of W k,p () into a space of the type (i), that is, in W j ,q (), is given by
the inclusion I of W k,p () in W j ,q (). Indeed, if the inclusion W k,p () ⊂ W j ,q ()
holds, then, by the closed graph theorem, the map I is continuous and hence an
embedding.
Taking into account that the elements of W k,p () are not functions defined in , but
are equivalence classes of functions which coincide up to a subset of  with zero
measure, we have to make precise the meaning of the embeddings of type (ii) and
(iii). It is that the equivalence class u ∈ W k,p () contains a function in the space
of the continuous functions which will be the image I u of the embedding. Thus,
j
for instance, the embedding W k,p () → CB,u () means that every u ∈ W k,p (),
considered as a function instead of an equivalence class, can be redefined in a subset
in  with zero measure in such a way that the modified function 
u (which is equal
j
to u in W k,p ()) belongs to CB,u () and, for some constant k > 0 independent of
u ∈ W k,p (), satisfies the inequality

uC j () ≤ kuk,p .
B,u

The embedding theorems need some hypotheses on the regularity of the boundary
∂ of . If x ∈ RN is a point and B ⊂ RN is an open ball such that x ∈ B, we call
the cone of vertex x and height r > 0 to the set
Cx = B(x, r) ∩ {x + λ(y − x) : y ∈ B, λ > 0} .
Definition A.4.2 We say that  satisfies the cone condition if there exists a cone C
such that every x ∈  is the vertex of a cone Cx contained in  and congruent (by a
rigid motion) to C.

A.4 Embedding Theorems

Every bounded domain  ⊂ RN with boundary ∂ of class C 1 satisfies the cone
condition. In general the converse assertion is not true (it suffices to consider a square
in R2 ).
An example of an open set  ⊂ R² which does not satisfy the cone condition is
the set of points of the unit ball in R² with distance to (1/2, 0) greater than or equal
to 1/2, i.e.,

The following examples show that this theorem is optimal.
Example A.4.4 Let  = B(0, R) be the ball of center 0 and radius R > 0 and fix
k ∈ N. If 1 ≤ p, q < ∞ and α > 0 are such that Nq < α < N −kp

u :  → R given by (A.1) satisfies u ∈ W () \ L (). Indeed, since
(α + k)p < N ,
Example A.1.3-3 shows that u ∈ W k,p (). Moreover, N < αq and hence u ∈ Lq ().
This example shows that the embedding of W k,p () in Lq () does not hold for
. It also proves that if kp < N then the embedding of W k,p () in C() is
q > NNp

not true.
Example A.4.5 Let k ∈ N and p > 1 such that kp = N . Consider  = B(0, R),
the ball of radius R > 0 centered at zero, and u :  → R given by (A.2). Clearly,

If p = 1 and N = k − 1, then it can be ν ∈ (0, 1].

This example proves that, for p > 1 and kp = N, even if the embeddings

Example A.4.6 Consider k ∈ N, 1 ≤ p < ∞ and ν ∈ (0, 1). If (k − 1) < Np < k,

then the embedding of W k,p () in CB,u
() is not true for ν > k − Np . Indeed, consider
R > 0, . = B(0, R) /and the function u :  → R defined by (A.1) with α ∈ R such
that α ∈ −ν, Np − k . Then (α + k)p < N and thus u ∈ W k,p ().
In addition, since α + ν > 0,
|u(x) − u(0)|
=| x |−α−ν , ∀x = 0
|x − 0|ν
and we see that it is not possible to redefine the function u in a set of zero measure
in such a way that the new function belongs to C ν ().
Example A.4.7 Let k ∈ N and p > 1 be such that (k − 1)p = N . We prove that
the embedding of case 5 fails for ν = 1 by showing a function u ∈ W k,p () which
cannot be redefined in a zero measure set to belong to C 1 (). Indeed, for R > 0,
consider the function u :  = B(0, R) → R given by (A.3). It is not difficult (see
Example A.1.3-3) to verify that

converges to +∞ as x goes to zero, we see that there is no function in the equivalence
class of the functions almost everywhere equal to u which belongs to the space C 1 ()
(furthermore, this equivalence class does not contain a locally Lipschitzian function
in ).
Our last example is devoted to show that TheoremA.4.3 is not true in general provided
that  is not smooth.

Observe that u ∈ W 1,p () for every p ≥ 1 and that the associated equivalence class

F. Rellich had already proved the compactness of some of the previous embeddings
in the case p = 2. The general case (p ≥ 1) was studied by V.I. Kondrachov.
Theorem A.4.9 (Compact embedding of Rellich–Kondrachov) Let  be a bounded

k,p

Since the zero extension of a function u ∈ W0 () is an element of W k,p (RN ), we can
k,p
consider W0 () as a subset of W k,p (RN ). Therefore, observing that Theorem A.4.3
is satisfied in the case  = RN , we deduce that it is also true if we replace the spaces
k,p
W k,p () in that theorem by W0 () (even if  does not satisfy the cone condition).
N
Similarly, if  ⊂ R is a bounded domain, taking an open ball B(0, R) (which
k,p
satisfies the cone condition) such that  ⊂ B(0, R), the inclusion W0 () ⊂
k,p
W (B(0, R)) holds and, by applying Theorem A.4.9 of Rellich–Kondrachov to
W k,p (B(0, R)), we deduce that the assertions of that theorem are also true if we
k,p
replace W k,p () by W0 (). Consequently, we have proved the following corollary.
Corollary A.4.10 If  is an open subset in RN , then all embeddings of Theoj +k,p
rem A.4.3 hold provided that we replace the space W j +k,p () by W0
().
If, in addition  is bounded, then all the compact embeddings in Theorem A.4.9
j +k,p
are also true if we replace the space W j +k,p () by W0
().
