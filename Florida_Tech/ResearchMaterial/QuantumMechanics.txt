Preface to the Fourth Edition

In this latest edition new material has been added, which includes many
additional clarifying remarks to some of the more advanced chapters. The
design of many ﬁgures has been reworked to enhance the didactic appeal of
the book. However, in the course of these changes, I have attempted to keep
intact the underlying compact nature of the book.
I am grateful to many colleagues for their help with this substantial revision. Special thanks go to Uwe Täuber and Roger Hilton for discussions,
comments and many constructive suggestions on this new edition. Some of
the ﬁgures which were of a purely qualitative nature have been improved by
Robert Seyrkammer in now being computer-generated. I am very obliged to
Andrej Vilfan for redoing and checking the computation of some of the scientiﬁcally more demanding ﬁgures. I am also very grateful to Ms Ulrike Ollinger
who undertook the graphical design of the diagrams. It is my pleasure to
thank Dr. Thorsten Schneider and Mrs Jacqueline Lenz of Springer for their
excellent co-operation, as well as the LE-TEX setting team for their careful
incorporation of the amendments for this new edition. Finally, I should like to
thank all colleagues and students who, over the years, have made suggestions
to improve the usefulness of this book.

Preface to the First Edition

This is a textbook on quantum mechanics. In an introductory chapter, the
basic postulates are established, beginning with the historical development,
by the analysis of an interference experiment. From then on the organization
is purely deductive. In addition to the basic ideas and numerous applications, new aspects of quantum mechanics and their experimental tests are
presented. In the text, emphasis is placed on a concise, yet self-contained,
presentation. The comprehensibility is guaranteed by giving all mathematical steps and by carrying out the intermediate calculations completely and
thoroughly.
The book treats nonrelativistic quantum mechanics without second quantization, except for an elementary treatment of the quantization of the radiation ﬁeld in the context of optical transitions. Aside from the essential core
of quantum mechanics, within which scattering theory, time-dependent phenomena, and the density matrix are thoroughly discussed, the book presents
the theory of measurement and the Bell inequality. The penultimate chapter
is devoted to supersymmetric quantum mechanics, a topic which to date has
only been accessible in the research literature.
For didactic reasons, we begin with wave mechanics; from Chap. 8 on we
introduce the Dirac notation. Intermediate calculations and remarks not essential for comprehension are presented in small print. Only in the somewhat
more advanced sections are references given, which even there, are not intended to be complete, but rather to stimulate further reading. Problems at
the end of the chapters are intended to consolidate the student’s knowledge.
The book is recommended to students of physics and related areas with
some knowledge of mechanics and classical electrodynamics, and we hope it
will augment teaching material already available.
This book came about as the result of lectures on quantum mechanics
given by the author since 1973 at the University of Linz and the Technical
University of Munich. Some parts of the original rough draft, ﬁgures, and
tables were completed with the help of R. Alkofer, E. Frey and H.-T. Janka.
Careful reading of the proofs by Chr. Baumgärtel, R. Eckl, N. Knoblauch,
J. Krumrey and W. Rossmann-Bloeck ensured the factual accuracy of the
translation. W. Gasser read the entire manuscript and made useful suggestions about many of the chapters of the book. Here, I would like to express my
sincere gratitude to them, and to all my other colleagues who gave important
assistance in producing this book, as well as to the publisher.

1. Historical and Experimental Foundations

1.1 Introduction and Overview
In spite of the multitude of phenomena described by classical mechanics and
electrodynamics, a large group of natural phenomena remains unexplained by
classical physics. It is possible to ﬁnd examples in various branches of physics,
for example, in the physics of atomic shells, which provide a foundation for
the structure of electron shells of atoms and for the occurrence of discrete
energy levels and of homopolar and Van der Waals bonding. The physics of
macroscopic bodies (solids, liquids, and gases) is not able to give – on the
basis of classical mechanics – consistent explanations for the structure and
stability of condensed matter, for the energy of cohesion of solids, for electrical and thermal conductivity, speciﬁc heat of molecular gases and solids at
low temperatures, and for phenomena such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, superﬂuidity, quantum crystals, and neutron stars. Nuclear physics
and elementary particle physics require absolutely new theoretical foundations in order to describe the structure of atomic nuclei, nuclear spectra,
nuclear reactions (interaction of particles with nuclei, nuclear ﬁssion, and
nuclear fusion), and the stability of nuclei, and similarly in order to make
predictions concerning the size and structure of elementary particles, their
mechanical and electromagnetic properties (mass, angular momentum (spin),
charge, magnetic moment, isospin), and their interactions (scattering, decay,
and production). Even in electrodynamics and optics there are eﬀects which
cannot be understood classically, for example, blackbody radiation and the
photoelectric eﬀect.
All of these phenomena can be treated by quantum theoretical methods.
(An overview of the elements of quantum theory is given in Table 1.1.) This
book is concerned with the nonrelativistic quantum theory of stable particles,
described by the Schrödinger equation.
First, a short summary of the essential concepts of classical physics is
given, before their limitations are discussed more thoroughly in Sect. 1.2.
At the end of the nineteenth century, physics consisted of classical mechanics, which was extended in 1905 by Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity,
together with electrodynamics.
Classical mechanics, based on the Newtonian axioms (lex secunda, 1687),
permits the description of the dynamics of point masses, e.g., planetary mo-

tion, the motion of a rigid body, and the elastic properties of solids, and
it contains hydrodynamics and acoustics. Electrodynamics is the theory of
electric and magnetic ﬁelds in a vacuum, and, if the material constants ε, μ, σ
are known, in condensed matter as well. In classical mechanics, the state of
a particle is characterized by specifying the position x(t) and the momentum p(t), and it seems quite obvious to us from our daily experience that
the simultaneous speciﬁcation of these two quantities is possible to arbitrary
accuracy. Microscopically, as we shall see later, position and momentum cannot simultaneously be speciﬁed to arbitrary accuracy. If we designate the
uncertainty of their components in one dimension by Δx and Δp, then the
relation ΔxΔp ≥ /2 must always hold, where  = 1.0545 × 10−27 erg s is
the Planck quantum of action1 . Classical particles are thus characterized by
position and velocity and represent a spatially bounded “clump of matter”.
On the other hand, electromagnetic waves, which are described by the
potentials A(x, t) and Φ(x, t) or by the ﬁelds E(x, t) and B(x, t), are spatially extended, for example, plane waves exp{i(k ·x− ωt)} or spherical waves
(1/r) exp{i(kr−ωt)}. Corresponding to the energy and momentum density of
the wave, the energy and momentum are distributed over a spatially extended
region.
In the following, using examples of historical signiﬁcance, we would like to
gain some insight into two of the main sources of the empirical necessity for a
new theoretical basis: (i) on the one hand, the impossibility of separating the
particle and wave picture in the microscopic domain; and (ii) the appearance
of discrete states in the atomic domain, which forms the point of departure
for the Bohr model of the atom.

1.2 Historically Fundamental Experiments
and Insights
At the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, the
inadequacy of classical physics became increasingly evident due to various
empirical facts. This will be illustrated by a few experiments.
1.2.1 Particle Properties of Electromagnetic Waves
1.2.1.1 Black-Body Radiation
Let us consider a cavity at temperature T in radiation equilibrium (Fig. 1.1).
The volume of the cavity is V = L3 , the energy density (energy per
unit volume and frequency) u(ω). Here u(ω)dω expresses the energy per unit
volume in the interval [ω, ω + dω]. Classically, the situation is described by
the Rayleigh–Jeans law
u(ω) =

One can easily make this plausible by considering standing plane waves in a
cavity with reﬂecting metal walls. The components of the electric ﬁeld are

The number of waves in the interval [ω, ω + dω] is, considering the vacuum

Furthermore, since the energy of an oscillator is kB T (where the Boltzmann
constant is kB = 1.3806 × 10−16 erg/K), one obtains because of the two

i.e., Eqn. (1.1). However, because of 0 u(ω)dω = ∞, this classical result
leads to the so-called “ultraviolet catastrophe”, i.e., the cavity would have to
possess an inﬁnite amount of energy (Fig. 1.2).
Although experiments at low frequencies were consistent with the Rayleigh–Jeans formula, Wien found empirically the following behavior at high
frequencies:
u(ω)dω = 2

ω→∞

u(ω) −→ Aω 3 e−gω/T (A, g = const) .
Then in 1900, Max Planck discovered (on the basis of profound thermodynamical considerations, he interpolated the second derivative of the entropy
between the Rayleigh–Jeans and Wien limits) an interpolation formula (the
Planck radiation law):
u(ω) =

Remark: The factor 1/8 arises because the ki -values of the standing wave are
positive. One obtains the same result for dN in the case of periodic boundary
conditions with exp{ik · x} and k = (n1 , n2 , n3 )2π/L and ni = 0, ± 1, ± 2, . . . .

1.2 Historically Fundamental Experiments and Insights

He also succeeded in deriving this radiation law on the basis of the hypothesis that energy is emitted from the walls into radiation only in multiples
of ω, that is En = n ω.
This is clear evidence for the quantization of radiation energy.
1.2.1.2 The Photoelectric Eﬀect
If light of frequency ω (in the ultraviolet; in the case of alkali metals in the
visible as well) shines upon a metal foil or surface (Hertz 1887, Lenard), one
observes that electrons with a maximal kinetic energy of
Ee =

mve2
= ω − W (W = work function)
2

Fig. 1.3. The photoelectric eﬀect

are emitted (Fig. 1.3). This led Albert Einstein in 1905 to the hypothesis that
light consists of photons, quanta of energy ω. According to this hypothesis,
an electron that is bound in the metal can only be dislodged by an incident
photon if its energy exceeds the energy of the work function W .
In classical electrodynamics, the energy density of light in vacuum is given
by (1/8π)(E 2 +H 2 ) (proportional to the intensity) and the energy ﬂux density
by S = (c/4π) E × H. Thus, one would expect classically at small intensities
that only after a certain time would enough energy be transmitted in order to
cause electron emission. Also, there should not be a minimum light frequency
for the occurrence of the photoelectric eﬀect. However, what one actually
observes, even in the case of low radiation intensity, is the immediate onset
of electron emission, albeit in small numbers (Meyer and Gerlach), and no
emission occurs if the frequency of the light is lowered below W/, consistent
with the quantum mechanical picture. Table 1.2 shows a few examples of real
work functions.
We thus arrive at the following hypothesis: Light consists of photons of
energy E = ω, with velocity c and propagation direction parallel to the
electromagnetic wave number vector k (reason: light ﬂash of wave number k).

With this we can already make a statement about the momentum and mass

Since |v| = c, it follows from (1.3) that m = 0 and thus E = pc. If we
compare this with E = ω = ck (electromagnetic waves: ω = ck), then
p = k results. Because p and k are parallel, it also follows that p = k.

Suppose that X-rays strike an electron (Fig. 1.4), which for the present purposes can be considered as free and at rest. In an elastic collision between an
electron and a photon, the four-momentum (energy and momentum) remains
conserved. Therefore,

If we bring the four-momentum of the photon after the collision over to the
left side of (1.5) and construct the four-vector scalar product (v μ qμ ≡ v 0 q 0 −

where λ̄c = /me c = 3.86 × 10−11 cm is the Compton wavelength of the
electron (me = 0.91 × 10−27 g, c = 2.99 × 1010 cm s−1 ). For the scattering of X-rays from electrons in carbon, for example, one ﬁnds the intensity
distribution of Fig. 1.5.

The collision of a photon with an electron leads to
an energy loss, i.e., to an increase in the wavelength.

The experiments just described reveal clearly the particle character of
light. On the other hand, it is certain that light also possesses wave properties,
which appear for example in interference and diﬀraction phenomena.
Now, a duality similar to that which we found for light waves also exists
for the conventional particles of classical physics.
1.2.2 Wave Properties of Particles,
Diﬀraction of Matter Waves
Davisson and Germer (1927), Thomson (1928), and Rupp (1928) performed
experiments with electrons in this connection; Stern did similar experiments
with helium. If a matter beam strikes a grid (a crystal lattice in the case of

8

electrons, because of their small wavelength), interference phenomena result
which are well known from the optics of visible light. Empirically one obtains
in this way for nonrelativistic electrons (kinetic energy Ekin = p2 /2m)

This experimental ﬁnding is in exact agreement with the hypothesis made by
de Broglie in 1923 that a particle with a total energy E and momentum p is to
be assigned a frequency ω = E/ and a wavelength λ = 2π/p. The physical
interpretation of this wave will have to be clariﬁed later (see Sect. 2.1). On
the other hand, it is evident on the basis of the following phenomena that in
the microscopic domain the particle concept also makes sense:

Ionization tracks in the Wilson chamber: The electrons that enter the
chamber, which is ﬁlled with supersaturated water vapor, ionize the gas
atoms along their paths. These ions act as condensation seeds and lead
to the formation of small water droplets as the water vapor expands and

1.2.3 Discrete States
1.2.3.1 Discrete Energy Levels
The state of aﬀairs will be presented by means of a short summary of the
recent history of atomic theory.
Thomson’s model of the atom assumed that an atom consists of an extended, continuous, positive charge distribution containing most of the mass,
in which the electrons are embedded.4 Geiger, and Geiger and Marsden (1908)
found backward and perpendicular scattering in their experiments, in which
alpha particles scattered oﬀ silver and gold. Rutherford immediately realized
that this was inconsistent with Thomson’s picture and presented his model
of the atom in 1911, according to which the electrons orbit like planets about
a positively charged nucleus of very small radius, which carries nearly the
4

By means of P. Lenard’s experiments (1903) – cathode rays, the Lenard window –
it was demonstrated that atoms contained negatively charged (−e0 ) particles
– electrons – about 2 000 times lighter than the atoms themselves. Thomson’s
model of the atom (J.J. Thomson, 1857–1940) was important because it attempted to explain the structure of the atom on the basis of electrodynamics;
according to his theory, the electrons were supposed to undergo harmonic oscillations in the electrostatic potential of the positively charged sphere. However, it
was only possible to explain a single spectral line, rather than a whole spectrum.

entire mass of the atom. Rutherford’s theory of scattering on a point nucleus
was conﬁrmed in detail by Geiger and Marsden. It was an especially fortunate circumstance (Sects. 18.5, 18.10) for progress in atomic physics that the
classical Rutherford formula is identical with the quantum mechanical one,
but it is impossible to overlook the diﬃculties of Rutherford’s model of the
atom. The orbit of the electron on a curved path represents an accelerated
motion, so that the electrons should constantly radiate energy away like a
Hertz dipole and spiral into the nucleus. The orbital frequency would vary
continuously, and one would expect a continuous emission spectrum. However, in fact experiments reveal discrete emission lines, whose frequencies, as
in the case of the hydrogen atom, obey the generalized Balmer formula

(Ry is the Rydberg constant, n and m are natural numbers). This result represents a special case of the Rydberg–Ritz combination principle, according
to which the frequencies can be expressed as diﬀerences of spectral terms.
In 1913, Bohr introduced his famous quantization condition.
He postu
lated as stationary states the orbits which fulﬁll the condition p dq = 2πn.5
This was enough to explain the Balmer formula for circular orbits. While
up to this time atomic physics was based exclusively on experimental ﬁndings whose partial explanation by the Bohr rules was quite arbitrary and
unsatisfactory – the Bohr theory did not even handle the helium atom properly – Heisenberg (matrix mechanics 1925, uncertainty relation 1927) and
Schrödinger (wave mechanics 1926) laid the appropriate axiomatic groundwork with their equivalent formulations for quantum mechanics and thus for
a satisfactory theory of the atomic domain.
Aside from the existence of discrete atomic emission and absorption spectra, an experiment by J. Franck and G. Hertz in 1913 also shows quite clearly
the presence of discrete energy levels in atoms.
In an experimental setup shown schematically in Fig. 1.6, electrons emitted from the cathode are accelerated in the electric ﬁeld between cathode
and grid and must then penetrate a small counterpotential before reaching
the anode. The tube is ﬁlled with mercury vapor. If the potential diﬀerence
between C and G is increased, then at ﬁrst the current I rises. However, as
soon as the kinetic energy of the electrons at the grid is large enough to knock

More precisely, the Bohr theory consists of three elements: (i) There exist stationary states, i.e., orbits which are constant in time, in which no energy is radiated.
(ii) The quantization condition: Stationary states are chosen from among those
which are possible according to Newtonian mechanics on the basis of the Ehrenfest adiabatic hypothesis , according to which adiabatically invariant quantities
– that is, those which remain invariant under a slow change in the parameters of
the system – are to be quantized. (iii) Bohr’s frequency condition: In an atomic
transition from a stationary state with energy E1 to one with energy E2 , the
frequency of the emitted light is (E1 − E2 )/.

mercury atoms into the ﬁrst excited state during a collision, they lose their
kinetic energy for the most part and, because of the negative countervoltage,
no longer reach the anode. This happens for the ﬁrst time at a voltage of
about 5 V. At 10 V, the excitation process occurs at half the distance between cathode and grid and again at the grid, etc. Only well deﬁned electron
energies can be absorbed by the mercury atoms, and the frequency of the
radiated light corresponds to this energy.
1.2.3.2 Quantization of Angular Momentum (Space Quantization)
In 1922, Stern and Gerlach shot a beam of paramagnetic atoms into a strongly
inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld and observed the ensuing deﬂections (Fig. 1.7).
According to electrodynamics, the force acting on a magnetic moment μ
under such conditions is given by
F = ∇(μ · B)

.

(1.8)

Here Bz  Bx , By , and hence the magnetic moment precesses about the
z-direction and μ · B ∼
= μz Bz . Now, the x- and y-dependence of Bz can be
neglected in comparison to the z-dependence, so that

11

(1.9)

where ez is a unit vector in the z-direction.
The deﬂection thus turns out to be proportional to the z-component of the
magnetic moment. Since classically μz varies continuously, one would expect
the beam to fan out within a broad range. However, what one actually ﬁnds
experimentally is a discrete number of beams, two in the case of hydrogen.
Apparently, only a few orientations of the magnetic moment μ with respect
to the ﬁeld direction are allowed. Thus, the Stern–Gerlach experiment gives
evidence for the existence of spin.

2. The Wave Function
and the Schrödinger Equation

2.1 The Wave Function
and Its Probability Interpretation
According to the considerations of Sect. 1.2.2 in connection with electron
diffraction, electrons also have wavelike properties; let this wave be ψ(x, t).
For free electrons of momentum p and energy E = p2 /2m, in accordance
with diﬀraction experiments, one can consider these to be free plane waves,
i.e., ψ takes the form
ψ(x, t) = C ei(k · x−ωt) with ω = E/ , k = p/ .

(2.1)

Now let us consider the question of the physical signiﬁcance of the wave function. For this we shall consider an idealized diﬀraction experiment (“thought
experiment”).

Fig. 2.1a–c. Diﬀraction at the double slit (a) with slit 1 open, (b) with slit 2 open,
(c) both slits open

Suppose electrons are projected onto a screen through a double slit
(Fig. 2.1). A photographic plate (or counter) in the plane of the screen
behind the double slit provides information on the image created by the

14

2. The Wave Function and the Schrödinger Equation

incident electrons. Suppose ﬁrst that one or the other of the slits is closed.
One then obtains the distributions 1 (x) and 2 (x), respectively, on the
screen (Fig. 2.1a,b). If both slits are open, an interference pattern is created
(Fig. 2.1c) with an ampliﬁcation of the intensity where the path length difference Δl between the slits is an integral multiple of the electron wavelength
λ, that is, Δl = nλ. Because of the interference, one has for the intensities
(x) = 1 (x) + 2 (x). We are familiar with such interference phenomena
with just such screen patterns in the optics of light and also in water waves.
If a cylindrical electromagnetic wave goes out from slit 1 with electric ﬁeld
E 1 (x, t), and one from slit 2 with electric ﬁeld E 2 (x, t), one gets the following
for the above experimental setup:
If only slit 1 is open, one has the intensity distribution I1 (x) = |E 1 (x, t)|2
on the screen, whereas if only slit 2 is open, one gets I2 (x) = |E 2 (x, t)|2 . Here
we have assumed that E j (x, t) ∝ exp{−iωt}, which is equivalent to timeaveraging the intensities of real ﬁelds, up to a factor of 2. If both slits are
open, one must superimpose the waves, and one obtains
E(x, t) = E 1 (x, t) + E 2 (x, t) ,
I = |E(x, t)|2 = I1 + I2 + 2 Re (E ∗1 · E 2 ) .
The third term in the total intensity represents the so-called interference
term.
Comparison with our electron experiment allows the following conclusion:
Hypothesis. The wave function ψ(x, t) gives the probability distribution
(x, t) = |ψ(x, t)|2

(2.2)

that an electron occupies the position x. Thus, (x, t) d3 x is the probability
of ﬁnding the electron at the location x in the volume element d3 x. According
to this picture, the electron waves ψ1 (x, t) and ψ2 (x, t), which cause screen
darkening 1 (x, t) = |ψ1 (x, t)|2 and 2 (x, t) = |ψ2 (x, t)|2 , are emitted from
slits 1 and 2, respectively. If both slits are open, then there is a superposition

Fig. 2.2. An interference pattern and its probability interpretation: Each electron makes a localized impact on the
screen. The interference pattern becomes visible after the impact of many electrons with the same wave function ψ(x, t)

2.2 The Schrödinger Equation for Free Particles

15

of the wave functions ψ1 (x, t) + ψ2 (x, t), and the darkening is proportional
to |ψ1 + ψ2 |2 (Fig. 2.2). Two important remarks:
(i)

Each electron makes a local impact, and the darkening of the photographic plate by a single electron is not smeared out. (x, t) is not the
charge distribution of the electron, but rather gives the probability density for measuring the particle at the position x at the time t.
(ii) This probability distribution does not occur by interference of many
simultaneously incoming electrons, but rather one obtains the same interference pattern if each electron enters separately, i.e., even for a very
low intensity source. The wave function thus applies to every electron
and describes the state of a single electron.
We shall try to construct a theory that provides the wave function ψ(x, t)
and thus a statistical description for the results of experiments. This theory
should reduce to classical mechanics in the limit of macroscopic objects.

2.2 The Schrödinger Equation for Free Particles
The equation of motion for ψ(x, t) should satisfy the following basic demands:
(i) It should be a ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation in time so that ψ(x, t)
will be determined by the initial distribution ψ(x, 0).
(ii) It must be linear in ψ in order for the principle of superposition
to hold, i.e., linear combinations of solutions are again solutions, and thus
interference eﬀects such as those of optics occur. (These follow in the same
way from the linearity of the Maxwell equations.) For the same reason, the
constants in the equation may not contain any quantities that depend on the
particular state of the particle such as its energy or momentum.
(iii) It should be homogeneous, so that

(2.3)
d3 x|ψ(x, t)|2 = 1
is satisﬁed at all times, because the total probability of ﬁnding the particle
somewhere in space is 1 (normalization).
Remark: If an inhomogeneity q in the equation were to occur, e.g.,
∂
ψ(x, t) = Dψ(x, t) + q ,

then one would have

the wave packet moves with the group velocity v = p0 /m = ∂E/∂p|p0 like a
classical particle, whereas the individual superimposed plane waves have the
phase velocities vph = Ep /p = p/2m. The quantity Δ increases with time t.
This means that the function |ψ|2 gets ﬂatter or “spreads” as time goes on,
and thus its degree of localization is reduced.

Thus,
position expectation value: x = vt ,

position uncertainty: Δx = d 1 + Δ2

(2.15)
.

(2.16)

In order to illustrate these results, we consider two examples.
(i) Let the particle being described by a Gaussian wave packet be a
macroscopic body of mass m = N mp ∼
= 1023 × 10−24 g = 10−1 g. In this
2
case, one thus ﬁnds Δ = t/2md ≈ 10−26 t/d2 (t and d in cgs-units, Δ
dimensionless). Such a body with initial positional uncertainty Δx =√d =
10−8 cm does not have Δ = 1 until 1010 s and thus has the width Δx = 2 d.
This value is quite irrelevant in comparison to the extension of a macroscopic
body.
(ii) On the other hand, for an α-particle, one gets
Δ = (10−27 /2 × 4 × 1.6 × 10−24 )

t
t ∼
= 10−4 2

d

.

With Δx = d = 10−11 cm at the time t = 0 one ﬁnds Δ = 1 for t ≈ 10−18 s.
Although this time is very short, whether or not the spreading is signiﬁcant
depends entirely on the problem. For example, an α-particle with speed v =
c/30 traverses a distance 10−9 cm during this time, which is much larger than
a nuclear radius (≈ 10−12 cm). However, this implies that during the collision
with a nucleus the trajectory can be described classically!
The time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is sketched in Fig. 2.3.

2.4 The Probability Distribution
for a Measurement of Momentum
Now we consider the question of what probability density describes the realization of particular values of momentum. In position space the probability of ﬁnding a particle at the position x in the volume d3 x was given by
(x, t)d3 x = |ψ(x, t)|2 d3 x. Correspondingly, let the probability of ﬁnding the
particle with momentum p in d3 p be represented by W (p, t)d3 p. Here, the
total probability is also normalized to 1:

d3 p W (p, t) = 1 .

(see Appendix A) ϕ(p, t), that is

space the following deﬁnition:

(2.20)

This is consistent with the idea that for a plane wave with momentum p0 the
Fourier transform ϕ(p, t) diﬀers from zero only for p = p0 .
Let us now return to the Gaussian wave packet in one dimension ((2.5),
specialized to one dimension, and (2.6)). For this special case, one obtains

the expectation value of the momentum is calculated as

Equation (2.24) represents a special case of the general uncertainty relation
Δx Δp ≥ /2 .
In the present context, it enters as a property of the Fourier transform and
implies that a spatially broadly extended wave packet corresponds to a small
spectrum of momentum values, whereas sharp wave packets can only be constructed from a broad band of Fourier components, i.e., they also contain
components of short wavelength. We will give the general derivation of this
later.

2.4.1 Illustration of the Uncertainty Principle
We would like to consider the following thought experiment to determine the
position of an electron: The electron is illuminated with light of wavelength
λ, and its image is projected onto a screen by means of an optical system.
Figure 2.4 shows the simpliﬁed experimental apparatus in principle. The
smallest distance which can be determined with a microscope is given by its
resolving power d = λ/ sin ϕ. The inaccuracy of localization of the electron
is thus Δx ≈ d = λ/ sin ϕ. This uncertainty can thus be reduced with
light of shorter wavelength. Now, the electron feels a back-reaction due to
the collision with the photon. If we take the extreme values of the possible
path of the photon, we see that the uncertainty of the x-component of the
momentum of the electron and the photon is roughly


2π
 sin ϕ .
Δpx ≈
λ
We thus obtain
Δx Δpx ≈ 2π

.

In the experiment described above, position and momentum cannot in principle be determined simultaneously to greater accuracy than that permitted
by this relation.
Two numerical examples will illustrate the uncertainty relation: The uncertainty relation holds even for macroscopic bodies. Consider for example
a bullet with speed v = 105 cm/s (supersonic speed) and an uncertainty in
the velocity of Δv = 10−2 cm/s, corresponding to Δp = m × 10−2 cm/s.
Now, the uncertainty relation says that the simultaneous determination of
the position is only possible up to an uncertainty of
Δx = (1/m) × 102  s cm−1 ∼
= (1/m) × 10−25 g cm ,
which becomes increasingly insigniﬁcant with growing mass. Even at a mass
of only 10−6 kg = 10−3 g, Δx ∼
= 10−22 cm ∼
= 10−14 atomic radii. On the

other hand, for electrons in an atom,
Δp ∼
= mv ∼
= 10−27 × 1010 /137 g cm/s and Δx ∼

(a: Bohr radius) which borders on what is permitted by the uncertainty
relation. Because the given values are comparable to the dimensions of the
eﬀects being investigated, the uncertainties have considerable signiﬁcance in
the atomic domain.
2.4.2 Momentum in Coordinate Space
As we have seen, one can determine momentum expectation values, uncertainties, etc., in momentum space by means of the probability density W (p, t)
deﬁned in (2.20). Can these also be calculated in coordinate space? To this
end we consider the familiar momentum expectation value

In the previous section, we encountered the ﬁrst example of the representation
of physical quantities by operators in quantum mechanics. For this reason,
we would like to summarize some of the properties of such objects here. We
base our discussion on the space L2 of square integrable functions (due to
the normalization condition).
Deﬁnition. An operator A is deﬁned by the prescription that for ψ(x) ∈ L2
it follows that
Aψ(x) = ϕ(x) ∈ L2

.

Examples:
Aψ = ψ 2 +

∂
ψ
∂xi

, Aψ = eψ ψ (nonlinear) .

Deﬁnition. A is called a linear operator if Aψ1 = ϕ1 and Aψ2 = ϕ2 imply
A(c1 ψ1 + c2 ψ2 ) = c1 ϕ1 + c2 ϕ2

,

(2.28)

where c1 , c2 are complex numbers.
Examples:
xi

,

∂
∂xi

, ∇2

,

∂
∂t

, f (x, t) as multiplier

.

Additional linear operators are obtained as the result of performing certain
operations with linear operators:
– Multiplication by a number c gives the operator cA: cAψ := c(Aψ)
– Sum of two operators
A + B: (A + B)ψ := Aψ + Bψ
(2.29)
– Product of two operators AB:

ABψ := A(Bψ) .

Two special operators are the
– unit operator

1

and the
– zero operator

1ψ = ψ
(2.30)

0

0ψ = 0 .

One has
A1 = 1A = A

, 0A = A0 = 0 .

Generally, operators are not commutative, AB = BA, i.e., ABψ = BAψ.

2. The Wave Function and the Schrödinger Equation

Deﬁnition. Commutator [A, B]: Let A, B be operators; then the commutator is deﬁned by
[A, B] = AB − BA .

[xi , xj ] = 0 ;
(2.34)
∂i , ∂j = 0 ; xi , ∂j = iδij ,

with ∂i = ∂/∂xi . If the commutator of two operators vanishes, one says
“The two operators commute”. Equation (2.34) shows that like spatial and
momentum components do not commute, while diﬀerent components do commute. One refers to xj and pj = −i∂j as canonical variables and (2.34) as
canonical commutation relations, which also can be written as
[xi , xj ] = 0 ; [pi , pj ] = 0

; [xi , pj ] = iδij

.

(2.34 )

Next, a scalar product is deﬁned in L2 . Let ϕ(x) and ψ(x) be arbitrary
functions in L2 :
Deﬁnition. Scalar product (ϕ, ψ): The scalar product of two wave functions
ψ and ϕ is deﬁned by

(2.35)
(ϕ, ψ) := d3 x ϕ∗ (x)ψ(x) .

2.4 The Probability Distribution for a Measurement of Momentum

25

The scalar product has the following properties:
(ϕ, ψ)∗ = (ψ, ϕ)

,

(2.36a)

(ϕ, c1 ψ1 + c2 ψ2 ) = c1 (ϕ, ψ1 ) + c2 (ϕ, ψ2 ) ,

(2.36b)

(c1 ϕ1 + c2 ϕ2 , ψ) = c∗1 (ϕ1 , ψ) + c∗2 (ϕ2 , ψ) .

(2.36c)

(The scalar product is linear in the second factor and antilinear in the ﬁrst
factor.)
Furthermore
(ϕ, ϕ) ≥ 0 and thus (ϕ, ϕ) = 0 ⇔ ϕ ≡ 0

.

Operators in the scalar product:

(ϕ, Aψ) = d3 x ϕ∗ (x)Aψ(x) .

(2.37)

(2.38)

Deﬁnition. A† is called the “adjoint operator to A” if
(A† ϕ, ψ) = (ϕ, Aψ)

,

(2.39a)

d3 x ϕ∗ Aψ

(2.39b)

i.e.,


d3 x(A† ϕ)∗ ψ =



holds for arbitrary ϕ and ψ.
Deﬁnition. The operator A is called Hermitian if
(Aϕ, ψ) = (ϕ, Aψ)

;

(2.40)

we then write2 A† = A.
The deﬁnition (2.39a) implies
(AB)† = B † A†

.

(2.41)

For later use, we state the following identities:
[AB, C] = A[B, C] + [A, C]B
[A, B]† = [B † , A† ] ,
2

,

(2.42)
(2.43)

In the mathematical literature the operator identity A† = A is used only, if in
addition to (2.40) the domains of A and A† are the same and are dense. A is
then termed self-adjoint.

[[A, B], A] = [[A, B], B] = 0, then
eA eB = eB eA e[A,B]

(2.46)

and
eA+B = eA eB e−[A,B]/2

.

(2.47)

2.5 The Correspondence Principle
and the Schrödinger Equation
2.5.1 The Correspondence Principle
We found in Sect. 2.4.2 that calculation of the momentum expectation value
in coordinate space requires construction of the scalar product (ψ, −i∇ψ).
We see further that the application of the operator −i∇ on a plane wave
ψ(x) = C exp {i(p · x − Et)/} with wave number p / just gives p times
the plane wave. Thus, the physical quantity momentum p is to be assigned
to the operator −i∇ in quantum mechanics. The procedure for the energy
E is quite similar. From this, one obtains the correspondences
momentum p −→
energy E −→ i

∂

i
.

(2.48)

To what extent can we assign quantum mechanical relations to classical ones
on the basis of this correspondence? For example, does the classical energy–
momentum relation for free particles E = p2 /2m imply the relation
i(∂/∂t) = −(2 /2m)∇2

?

This certainly cannot hold as an operator identity, but only when applied to
a class of states, i.e.,
E = p2 /2m −→ i

2.5 The Correspondence Principle and the Schrödinger Equation

27

But this is precisely the Schrödinger equation (2.4) for free particles. So, from
the classical energy–momentum relation, that is, from the classical Hamiltonian for a free particle, we have obtained the Schrödinger equation for a free
particle.
This leads us to the quantum mechanical correspondence principle: In
quantum mechanics, operators are assigned to physical quantities. Quantum
mechanical relationships correspond to classical relationships.3 This can be
used to set up the Schrödinger equation on the basis of the classical Hamiltonian. We would now like to investigate this and use it to derive the equation
of motion in a potential by assuming the classical Hamiltonian p2 /2m+V (x).
The Schrödinger equation for a particle in the potential V (x) is obtained
as follows. The assignment

2.5.2 The Postulates of Quantum Theory
In a preliminary formulation of the theory developed up to now, which will be
summarized more compactly in Sect. 2.9.4, the basic postulates of quantum
mechanics are:
1. The state of a system is described by the wave function ψ(x, t);
|ψ(x, t)|2 d3 x expresses the probability of ﬁnding the particle at the time
t at the position x in the volume element d3 x.
2. Quantum mechanically, operators A, B, . . . are assigned to the physically
measurable quantities (observables) of classical mechanics.
3. The average values of operators are given by

A = d3 xψ ∗ (x, t)Aψ(x, t) ,
if the system is in the state ψ(x, t).
3

In this use of the concept correspondence principle we deviate from the traditional use. Traditionally, one considers the Bohr correspondence principle as
the statement that for large quantum numbers, quantum mechanical laws must
reduce to their classical counterparts.

28

2. The Wave Function and the Schrödinger Equation

4. The time evolution of the states is described by the Schrödinger equation:
i

2 2
∂
ψ(x, t) = Hψ(x, t) with H = −
∇ + V (x) .
∂t
2m

Additionally:
(i)

If one assigns to the classical quantity a the operator A, then the powers
satisfy a2 −→ A2 , a3 −→ A3 , etc.
(ii) As we will see later, the operators corresponding to observables must
be Hermitian.
(iii) From (2) and (3) it follows that |ϕ(p, t)|2 /(2π)3 is the probability density in momentum space (i.e., for momentum measurements), as we will
see in Sect. 2.9.3.
2.5.3 Many-Particle Systems
Finally, we seek the Schrödinger equation for a system of N particles.
The state of this N -particle system is described by the wave function
ψ(x1 , x2 , . . . , xN , t), where xi are the coordinates of the ith particle. Therefore, |ψ(x1 , x2 , . . . , xN , t)|2 d3 x1 d3 x2 . . . d3 xN is the probability of ﬁnding
the particles 1, . . . , N at time t in the volume elements d3 x1 , . . . , d3 xN .

2.6 The Ehrenfest Theorem
Classical Newtonian mechanics must be contained in quantum mechanics as
a limiting case. In this section, we would like to investigate in what sense this
is true.

(2.56b)

If the two equations are combined, an equation which is analogous to the
Newtonian equation of motion is obtained:
m

d2
x = F (x)
dt2

.

(2.56c)

This, and more generally, (2.54), constitute the Ehrenfest theorem: “Classical
equations hold for the average values.” However, this does not yet imply that
the average values x and p obey the classical equations of motion. In
order for this to hold, the average value of the force

F (x) = d3 x ψ ∗ (x, t)F (x)ψ(x, t)
must be replaceable by its value F ( x ) at the position x . To obtain a
criterion for the validity of such an approximation, we expand the force F
about the average value x :
Fi (x) = Fi ( x ) + (xj − xj )Fi,j ( x )
+ 12 (xj − xj )(xl − xl )Fi,jl ( x ) + . . .

,

(2.57a)

where fi,j ≡ ∂fi /∂xj and we sum over repeated indices. Since (xj − xj ) =
0, one has
Fi (x) = Fi ( x ) + 12 (xj − xj )(xl − xl ) Fi,jl ( x ) + . . .

.

To replace F (x) by F ( x ) in (2.56c) is thus exact whenever the second
and higher derivatives of the force vanish (for example, in the case of free
particles or the harmonic oscillator). It is approximately valid whenever the
wave packet is localized to such a degree that F (x) changes slowly within
the range of its extension, i.e.,
(Δxj )2 Fi,jj ( x )
 1
Fi ( x )

,

(2.57b)

where for brevity we assume that the wave function is symmetric about the
average value, (xj − xj )(xl − xl ) = δjl (Δxj )2 , and Δxj is the spread of
the packet in the j-direction.

2.7 The Continuity Equation for the Probability Density

31

Remarks:
(i)
(ii)

The fact that x obeys the classical equation of motion does not imply that
quantum eﬀects are unimportant for harmonic oscillators.
By reversing the inequality (2.57b) one may conclude that quantum features
will be signiﬁcant if the characteristic length of the potential is smaller than
that of the wave packet. Alternatively, for wavelengths larger than the length
over which the potential varies, one ﬁnds quantum features.

2.7 The Continuity Equation
for the Probability Density
Because of (2.52a,b), the time rate of change of the probability density (2.2)
becomes

(2.58)

We deﬁne the probability current density
j(x, t) =


[ψ ∗ (∇ψ) − (∇ψ ∗ )ψ]

(2.59)

From this, the continuity equation follows from (2.58)

(x, t) + ∇ · j(x, t) = 0

Remark: We can now show that the norm of the wave function remains constant
in time by allowing the volume in (2.61) to go to inﬁnity. A normalized wave
function must vanish faster than 1/|x|3/2 at inﬁnity in order for the integral over
the probability density to be ﬁnite. With (2.59) and the assumption that possible
periodic dependencies are only of the form eik · x for large x it follows that

2.8 Stationary Solutions of the Schrödinger Equation,
Eigenvalue Equations
2.8.1 Stationary States
Assuming that H is time independent, one can solve the Schrödinger equation
by separation into a time dependent and a spatially dependent part:
ψ(x, t) = f (t)ψ(x) .

(2.62)

The Schrödinger equation (2.49) then yields
∂
1
1
i f (t) =
Hψ(x) .
f (t) ∂t
ψ(x)
Since the left side only depends on t, and the right side only on x, both sides
must be equal to a constant, which we call E. Thus, f (t) must satisfy the
diﬀerential equation
i

∂
f (t) = Ef (t)
∂t

(2.63)

with solution
f (t) = e−iEt/

.

(2.64)

Similarly, we obtain for the spatially dependent part
Hψ(x) = Eψ(x) .

(2.65)

This equation is known as the time independent Schrödinger equation.
Remarks:
The states ψ(x, t) = exp {−iEt/}ψ(x) are called stationary states,
since the corresponding probability densities |ψ(x, t)|2 = |ψ(x)|2 are
time independent.

(ii) The condition of normalizability ( d3 x|ψ(x)|2 < ∞) will limit the allowed values of the energy E.

(i)

2.8 Stationary Solutions of the Schrödinger Equation

33

2.8.2 Eigenvalue Equations
Equation (2.65) is an eigenvalue equation. We would now like to give a general
discussion of these.
The quantity ψ is an eigenfunction of an operator A with eigenvalue a
when
Aψ = aψ

(2.66)

holds. This equation is called an eigenvalue equation. In the following it is
assumed that the operator A is Hermitian.
Theorem 1. Eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are real.
Proof:
From (2.66), it follows that
(ψ, Aψ) = (ψ, aψ) = a(ψ, ψ)

.

The complex conjugate equation is
(Aψ, ψ) = (aψ, ψ) = a∗ (ψ, ψ)

.

Since A is Hermitian, (Aψ, ψ) = (ψ, Aψ) holds, and we ﬁnd by taking the
diﬀerence of the two equations
0 = (a − a∗ )(ψ, ψ) ⇒ a = a∗

.

(2.67)

Hermitian operators must be assigned to all measurable quantities (observables), in order that the expectation values and – as shown in Sect. 2.9 –
the measured values be real. The operators H, p, and x which we have encountered up to now are indeed Hermitian, as follows immediately from the
deﬁnition.
Theorem 2. Eigenfunctions of Hermitian operators belonging to diﬀerent
eigenvalues are orthogonal.
Proof:
Given the two eigenvalue equations
Aψm = am ψm and Aψn = an ψn

,

we take the scalar product of the second equation with ψm , use the Hermiticity of A, and substitute the ﬁrst eigenvalue equation:
an (ψm , ψn ) = (ψm , Aψn ) = (Aψm , ψn ) = am (ψm , ψn )

.

34

2. The Wave Function and the Schrödinger Equation

From this it follows that
0 = (an − am )(ψm , ψn )

.

For an = am it thus follows that
(ψm , ψn ) = 0

.

(2.68)

If several eigenfunctions belong to the same eigenvalue (degeneracy), one can
orthogonalize as follows: We deﬁne
∗
(ψm , ψn ) = Cmn with Cmn
= Cnm

.

(2.69)

As known from linear algebra, the Hermitian matrix C can be brought into
the diagonal form C D = U † CU by means of a unitary transformation U. For
this transformation, it follows from (2.69) that


∗
(Umα ψm , ψn Unβ ) =

Cmn Unβ = CαD δαβ .

We now introduce the new functions ϕβ =
to (2.70) are orthogonal. Using



n ψn Unβ

, which according

ϕα −→ ϕα /(ϕα , ϕα )1/2
one can normalize them to unity.
Thus, the eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator can always be chosen
such that the orthogonality relation
(ψm , ψn ) = δmn

(2.71)

is satisﬁed. Moreover, the eigenfunctions of the operators we are considering
satisfy the completeness relation

ψn∗ (x )ψn (x) = δ(x − x ) .
(2.72)
n

The ψn thus form a complete set of orthonormal eigenfunctions. Thus, a
general state ψ(x) can be expanded (represented) as


dx ψn (x)ψn∗ (x )ψ(x ) ,
ψ(x) = dx δ(x − x )ψ(x ) =

that is
ψ(x) =

with
cn = (ψn , ψ) .

(2.74)

2.8 Stationary Solutions of the Schrödinger Equation

The normalization condition (2.3) and the orthogonality relation (2.71) imply
that

Remark: The Schmidt orthogonalization procedure for degenerate eigenfunctions
ψ1 , ψ2 , . . . . Instead of diagonalizing the matrix C deﬁned in (2.69) and thus determining the unitary matrix U of (2.70), it is sometimes more convenient to perform a
stepwise orthogonalization of a system of degenerate but linearly independent eigenfunctions. Beginning with ψ1 , ψ2 , . . ., the functions ϕ1 , ϕ2 , . . . are deﬁned as follows:
ϕj is constructed from ψj by projecting out all parts proportional to ϕ1 , .... ,ϕj−1 ,
i.e.,
C1 ϕ1 = ψ1

C1 = (ψ1 , ψ1 )1/2

C2 ϕ2 = ψ2 − ϕ1 (ϕ1 , ψ2 )

C2 = ((ψ2 , ψ2 ) − |(ψ2 , ϕ1 )|2 )1/2

C3 ϕ3 = ψ3 − ϕ1 (ϕ1 , ψ3 ) − ϕ2 (ϕ2 , ψ3 )
..
.

..
.

2.8.3 Expansion in Stationary States
Orthogonality and completeness hold in particular for the eigenfunctions of
the Hamiltonian, i.e., for the stationary states ψn :
Hψn = En ψn
ψn (x, t) = e

,

(2.75)

−iEn t/

ψn (x) .

(2.76)

The En and ψn are called energy eigenvalues and energy eigenfunctions. For
the solution of the Schrödinger equation, ψ(x, t) at the initial time t = 0,
one has the expansion (2.73). Now, we know the time development of the
individual ψn (x, t) and ﬁnd for the sum

cn e−iEn t/ ψn (x) with cn = (ψn , ψ(t = 0)) .
(2.77)
ψ(x, t) =
n

It is easy to check that this ψ(x, t) is indeed a solution of the time dependent
Schrödinger equation:

∂


cn e−iEn t/ ψn (x) = Hψ(x, t) .

n

The expansion in terms of stationary states (2.77) solves the quantum
mechanical initial value problem. The wave function ψ(x, t = 0) at the initial
time t = 0 determines ψ(x, t).

Let an operator A with a complete, orthonormal system of eigenfunctions
ψm be given with eigenvalues am and a wave function

ψ(x) =
cm ψm (x) .
(2.78)
m

What is the physical signiﬁcance of the eigenvalues am and the expansion
coeﬃcients cm ? In order to clarify this question, we begin by introducing a
few concepts from probability theory.
2.9.1 Some Concepts from Probability Theory
Let X be an arbitrary random variable4 taking values x, and w(x)dx the
probability that the random variable takes a value in the interval [x, x + dx].
Deﬁnition 1.
 +∞
mn =
xn w(x)dx = X n

is called the nth moment of the distribution w(x).
Deﬁnition 2.
 +∞
χ(τ ) =
e−ixτ w(x)dx

(2.80)

−∞

is called the characteristic function.
χ(τ ) is the Fourier transform of w(x). Inverting the transformation, one
obtains
 +∞
dτ ixτ
e χ(τ ) .
(2.81)
w(x) =
2π

A quantity X is called a random variable if it assumes values x depending on the
elements e of a “set of events” E. For each individual observation the event and
thus the value of X is uncertain, and solely the probability for the appearance of
a particular result (event) of E is known. For instance, in tossing a die the event
is the appearance of a particular side of the die, and the random variable is the
associated number of dots, which can assume values from 1 to 6, each with the
probability 1/6. If e ∈ E is an event contained in E and Pe its probability, then
for a large number of trials N , the number Ne of times the event e appears is
related to Pe by limN→∞ Ne /N = Pe . See for instance W. Feller: An Introduction
to Probability Theory and Its Applications, Vol. I (Wiley, New York, 1968).

Expansion of the exponential function in (2.80) together with the deﬁnition (2.79) gives
χ(τ ) =

(2.82)

If all the moments are known, then by substitution of (2.82) into (2.81) one
can determine w(x).
Let F (X) be a function of the random variable X. Then the average value
of F (X) is introduced by:
Deﬁnition 3.

 +∞
F (x)w(x) dx

F (X) =

Thus the nth moment deﬁned in (2.79) equals the average value of X n and
the characteristic function can also be represented as
χ(τ ) = e−iXτ

(2.80 )

.

2.9.2 Application to Operators with Discrete Eigenvalues
(i)

Let the system be in an eigenstate ψm of A. Then, because of postulates
2 and 3,
An = (ψm , An ψm ) = (am )n

(2.83)

and thus according to (2.82)
χ(τ ) =

 (−i)n τ n (am )n
n!

n

= e−iτ am

.

(2.84)

Let w(a)da be the probability that the observable represented by A
takes values in the interval [a, a + da]. Then, by (2.81)

dτ iaτ −iτ am
e e
= δ(a − am ) ,
(2.85)
w(a) =

i.e., one measures with certainty thevalue am .

in (i) then become

Examination of (2.88) shows that the probability density vanishes when a
does not coincide with one of the eigenvalues. Thus, the result of a measurement can only be one of the eigenvalues am . The probability of measuring
am is |cm |2 . (Thus, for example, the possible values of the energy are the
energy eigenvalues En , and the expansion coeﬃcients in (2.77) determine the
probability |cn |2 .)
What is the state after a particular result has been measured? After a
measurement with the result am , the system must be in the eigenstate ψm ,
because repetition of the measurement should give the same result. If the
system was originally not in an eigenstate of the observable, then the measurement changes the state! The fact that a measurement can change the
state of a system was seen in Sect. 2.4.1.
If after the measurement the wave function is precisely known and is not
further altered by the measurement in some uncontrolled way, one refers to
this as an ideal measurement. After an ideal measurement, the system ﬁnds
itself in an eigenstate of the operator corresponding to the observable.
2.9.3 Application to Operators with a Continuous Spectrum
As an example of an operator with a continuous spectrum, we consider the
momentum p (one-dimensional). Integration of the eigenvalue equation
 ∂
ψp (x) = pψp (x)
i ∂x

(2.89)

yields for the momentum eigenfunctions the ubiquitous plane waves
ψp (x) = (2π)−1/2 eipx/

.

(2.90)

The ψp (x) form a complete, orthonormal system, where the sum over the
discrete index n in (2.72) is replaced by an integral over p, and the Kronecker
δ in (2.71) is replaced by a Dirac δ-function.

(2.95b)

From this we see that the expression W (p), introduced in the development
of our conceptual system as a temporary hypothesis (2.20), is not a separate
axiom, as mentioned above, but rather a consequence of the form of the
momentum operator and axiom III.
Now let us consider the position eigenfunctions
ψξ (x) = δ(x − ξ) ,

(2.96)

which evidently satisfy
xψξ (x) = ξψξ (x)

.

(2.97)

The quantity ψξ (x) is sharply localized in space. These are also eigenfunctions
with a continuous spectrum; they satisfy the following orthogonality and
completeness relations:
(ψξ , ψξ ) = δ(ξ − ξ  ) ,

dξ ψξ (x)ψξ (x ) = δ(x − x )

(2.98)
.

(2.99)

40

2. The Wave Function and the Schrödinger Equation

Now, evidently,

ψ(x) = dξ ψ(ξ)ψξ (x)

,

(2.100)

that is, the expansion coeﬃcients of the position eigenfunctions are just given
by the wave function. It follows that |ψ(ξ)|2 is the probability density for the
position ξ.
Remark: One also refers to ψ(x) as the wave function in the x-representation
or coordinate representation, while ϕ(p), which contains the same information, is
referred to as the p-representation or momentum representation.

In many cases, the spectrum of an operator consists of a discrete part
(eigenvalues an , eigenfunctions ψn ) and a continuous part (eigenvalues a,
eigenfunctions ψa ). The expansion of a wave function is then


ψ(x) =
cn ψn (x) + da c(a)ψa (x) ≡ S cn ϕn .
(2.101)
n

n

The symbol S is used to cover both summation and integration. (We will
n
use the symbol S only when making special reference to the simultaneous
n
existence of a continuous and a discrete partof the spectrum; otherwise, we
will simply use the discrete representation n .) The probability density is
then

|cn |2 δ(a − an ) + |c(a)|2 .
(2.102)
w(a) =
n

We can now formulate the axioms of quantum theory in ﬁnal form.
2.9.4 Axioms of Quantum Theory
I. The state is described by the wave function ψ(x).
II. The observables are represented by Hermitian operators A . . . , with
functions of observables being represented by the corresponding functions of the operators.
III. The expectation value of the observable represented by the operator A
is given in the state ψ by
A = (ψ, Aψ)

.

V. If in a measurement of A the value an is found, the wave function changes

From axioms II and III it follows that the only possible results of a measurement of an observable are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator
A, and the probabilities are given by |cn |2 , where cn are the expansion coeﬃcients of ψ(x) in the eigenfunctions of A. In particular, it follows that |ψ(x)|2
is the probability density for the position.
Remarks:
(i) We add a comment on terminology. Measurable physical quantities (also
referred to as dynamical variables) are called observables. We distinguish these
from their mathematical counterparts, the operators they are represented by. In a
number of expositions of quantum mechanics the term “observable” is used instead
to denote any Hermitian operator which possesses a complete set of eigenfunctions.
For convenience we use the same symbol for the observable as for the operator.
The one to one correspondence between observables and operators allows terminology such as “the observable A” or even “the average value of the operator A”.
(ii) Experimentally, in principle, the average value of an observable (e.g. the
momentum) is determined as follows. One prepares a large number, say N , of identical systems, all in one and the same state ψ(x). One then measures the observable
in question for each system. In general, a range of measured values is obtained (the
distribution depending on the state). The observable is truly a random variable.
The experimental average value of the observable is the sum of the measured values
divided by N . For this series of measured values, any function (e.g., a power) of
the measured values can be computed. Again taking the average value, one obtains
the experimental average value of a function of the observable. Axioms III and II
state how these average values are computed quantum mechanically by means of
the operator corresponding to the observable and the wave function. The process
of measurement is studied in detail in Chap. 20, see Sect. 20.3, 20.3.4.

2.10 Additional Points
2.10.1 The General Wave Packet
We saw examples of wave packets in Sects. 2.3 and 2.4. The general wave
packet has the form

d3 p
g(p) exp {i(p · x − E(p)t + α(p))/} .
(2.103)
ψ(x, t) =
(2π)3
Comparison with (2.5) shows that ϕ(p) = g(p) exp{iα(p)}. Suppose that the
real weight function g(p) has a maximum at p0 and diﬀers signiﬁcantly from
zero only in a region with |p − p0 |  Δp. For most of the values of the
position variable x, the phase factor will vary rapidly over this momentum
region and therefore give ψ(x, t) = 0. Now, ψ(x, t) is maximal at that position
x(t) for which the phase is stationary, i.e., where the condition
∇p (p · x − E(p)t + α(p))|p0 = 0

(2.104)

42

2. The Wave Function and the Schrödinger Equation

holds. This yields the “stationarity condition”
x(t) = x0 + v 0 t

(2.105a)

with
x0 = −∇p α(p)|p0 and v 0 = ∇p E(p)|p0

.

(2.105b)

Since for this value x(t) the phase does not vary rapidly as a function of momentum p in the vicinity of p0 , i.e., is stationary, ψ(x, t) is large at the position x(t). Thus x(t) describes approximately the center of the wave packet
and therefore can be compared to the classical position of the particle, which
moves with the group velocity v 0 . In order to calculate the integral (2.103),
we expand the phase about p0 :
p · x − E(p)t + α = p0 · x − E(p0 )t + α(p0 )
+ (x − ∇p E(p)t + ∇p α(p))|p0 · (p − p0 )

The spreading of the wave packet in position space is found by considering the x-dependence in the integrand of (2.106) (or its three-dimensional
counterpart) in the following way: if Δp is the width of g(p), then there is
constructive interference everywhere in the domain of integration if the real
part (or imaginary part) of the exponential function exp {i(x−x(t))(p−p0 )/}
does not change sign, i.e., (x − x(t)) roughly satisﬁes the condition
|x − x(t)|Δp/  π2

.

2.10 Additional Points

43

On the other hand, there is destructive interference for
|x − x(t)|Δp/  π

.

Thus, in order of magnitude, the spreading of the wave packet, i.e., the positional uncertainty Δx is related to the uncertainty of the momentum Δp
by
ΔxΔp ∼
= π

;

(2.107)

we obtained this result earlier in the discussion of the Gaussian wave packet.
The second phase factor exp {−it(p − p0)2 /2m} increasingly counteracts the
ﬁrst with growing t. For this reason, one still gets a ﬁnite result for the
wave function ψ(x, t) even for larger values of |x − x(t)|, i.e., the wave packet
spreads out, as we showed earlier in the case of the Gaussian wave packet.5
Subject to the condition
t(Δp)2
 1 ,
m

(2.108)

it is possible to neglect the spreading in time.
2.10.2 Remark on the Normalizability of the Continuum States
The eigenfunctions of the momentum operator fulﬁll the orthogonality condition (2.91). The ψp (x) are thus evidently not normalized to 1. By superposition of such states, however, one can construct wave packets which are
quadratically integrable and thus normalizable to 1. An analogous situation
arises in the case of the continuum states (E > 0) of the Hamiltonian. For the
bound states (E < 0), only normalized eigenfunctions with discrete eigenvalues are to be considered. The remaining solutions of the time independent
Schrödinger equation with E < 0 are divergent at inﬁnity, and thus cannot
be normalized even using superposition.
One can avoid the problem of normalizability of continuum states by
introducing a ﬁnite volume V = L3 . The states

The positional uncertainty of (2.106) is most easily calculated in the momentum representation (see Chap. 8). The calculation is given for example in W.

In such a ﬁnite normalization volume, the continuum states become discrete
and are normalized to unity as well.
The non-normalizable solutions of the time independent Schrödinger
equation for E < 0 remain unacceptable even if one encloses the system
in a ﬁnite box, because they do not satisfy the boundary conditions.

there would be an eigenfunction of n̂ with ﬁnite norm and negative eigenvalue,
in contradiction to the positivity of the eigenvalues.
Thus, all the stationary states of the harmonic oscillator are given by
Table 3.1 or (3.19 ). The operators a† (a) raise (lower) the energy eigenvalue by
ω and are therefore called creation (annihilation) operators and occasionally
ladder operators.
Remarks:
(i) There can however exist non-square-integrable eigenfunctions with negative eigenvalues. For example

is a positive deﬁnite operator. Similarly, ψ̃ = exp((x/x0 )2 /2) is a non-normalizable
eigenfunction of a† (a† ψ̃ = 0) and also of n̂ with the eigenvalue −1.
(ii) The ground state, Eqn. (3.14), is not degenerate. One can deduce from this
that none of the remaining eigenvalues of n̂ are degenerate, because if corresponding
to n there were another orthonormal eigenfunction ϕn besides ψn , then an ϕn would
be a ground state eigenfunction orthogonal to ψ0 , which is a contradiction.

3.1.3 The Zero-Point Energy
Classically, the lowest energy of the harmonic oscillator is E = 0; quantum
mechanically, it is ω/2. Since ψ0 (x) does not minimize V (x) alone, but rather
the sum of the kinetic and potential energy, a ﬁnite ground state energy
or “zero-point energy” results. To illustrate this further, we calculate the
uncertainty product ΔxΔp. For the average value and the square ﬂuctuation
of position, we ﬁnd
x = (ψn , xψn ) ∝ (ψn , (a + a† )ψn ) = 0

,


(ψn , (a2 + aa† + a† a + a†2 )ψn ) = x20 (n + 1/2) ,
2ωm
and similarly for the momentum
(Δx)2 = x2 =

p = 0 , (Δp)2 = p2 =

2
(n + 1/2) .
x20

For the uncertainty product, one thus gets
ΔxΔp = (n + 1/2) .

(3.31)

This is a minimum for the ground state. The ground state wave function is
not concentrated at x = 0 – the minimum of the potential – but rather
has the spatial extension x0 and a corresponding ﬁnite positional uncertainty
(= ﬂuctuation). This behavior, which is characteristic for quantum theory,
is known as the “zero-point ﬂuctuation”. We would also like to derive an
inequality for the zero-point energy without explicit calculation of the wave
function, but only using the uncertainty relation
ΔxΔp ≥

(3.32)

Since by symmetry p = x = 0 must hold for the ground state (see
Sect. 3.6),
p2 x2 ≥

3.1.4 Coherent States
The position expectation value vanishes for the stationary states, i.e., x = 0;
these states therefore individually have nothing in common with the classical oscillatory motion. We now determine solutions of the time dependent
Schrödinger equation representing periodic motion. We ﬁrst determine wave
functions for which at the initial time t = 0 the average value of x is diﬀerent
from zero x = 0. This is certainly the case for states ϕα which satisfy
aϕα = αϕα

(3.36)

with some complex number α, i.e., which are eigenfunctions of the annihilation operator. Since

with

.

(3.40)

ϕα (x, t) is a solution of the time dependent Schrödinger equation. These
states are called coherent states, since they are of signiﬁcance in optics for
the representation of coherent light waves. Incidentally, they were derived by
Schrödinger in one of his ﬁrst papers1 and have become very popular since
the invention of the laser. The position expectation value is time dependent
in the state ϕα (x, t):
x0
x = (ϕα(t) , xϕα(t) ) = √ (ϕα(t) , (a + a† )ϕα(t) )
2
x0
= √ (α(t) + α∗ (t)) .
2
If we write α in the form α = |α|eiδ , then we ﬁnally get
√
x = 2x0 |α| cos (ωt − δ) .

(3.41)

The position expectation value thus has the same time dependence as the
classical oscillation.
From (3.37) and (3.39), one can easily calculate with the help of (2.47)
the representation

A coherent state is a Gaussian wave packet which does not spread out because

Classical limit: For large α (without loss of generality: δ = 0 and α > 0), i.e.,
large oscillation amplitudes, the coeﬃcients αn /n! have a sharp maximum for
n0 = α2 ; the relative width of the n-values contributing to (3.37) decreases

like (n − n0 )/n0 ∼ 1/ n0 . Since n0 ∼ α2 , the√
energy of the oscillator is then
(ϕα , Hϕα ) = ωα2 = mω 2 A2 /2, where A = 2x0 α is the amplitude of the
oscillation, consistent with classical mechanics.

3.2 Potential Steps
In both nuclear and solid-state physics, one often deals with potentials which
can be divided up into regions inside which they are more or less constant,
but where the transition from one region to another occurs within a very
short distance. Since we are familiar with the solution of the free Schrödinger
equation, we would now like to study, as an idealization of such physical
situations, motion in potential steps and related problems.
3.2.1 Continuity of ψ(x) and ψ  (x)
for a Piecewise Continuous Potential
Let us consider a one-dimensional potential with a discontinuity at the position a (Fig. 3.4). The time independent Schrödinger equation for this problem
takes the form
d2 ψ(x)
2m
= − 2 (E − V (x))ψ(x)
dx2


.

(3.43)

Fig. 3.4. A potential with a discontinuity

Now, suppose that ψ(x) or ψ  (x) were discontinuous at a. Then, the behavior
ψ(x) ∼ Θ(x− a) would have the consequence ψ  (x) ∼ δ  (x− a), and similarly
the behavior ψ  (x) ∼ Θ(x − a) would imply ψ  (x) ∼ δ(x − a). However, since
by the right-hand side of (3.43) ψ  (x) may make at most a ﬁnite jump at
the position a, our supposition leads to a contradiction. Consequently, ψ(x)
and ψ  (x) must be continuous even if the potential V (x) is merely piecewise
continuous. At the discontinuity a of V (x), one thus obtains the continuity
conditions
ψI (a) = ψII (a) ,

(3.44a)


ψI (a) = ψII

(3.44b)

3.2 Potential Steps

It is often convenient to use, in place of the second equation,
ψI (a)
ψ  (a)
= II
ψI (a)
ψII (a)

,

(3.44c)

which results upon division of (3.44b) by (3.44a) and which implies the continuity of the logarithmic derivative. (ψI,II represent the solutions for the
regions I and II, respectively.)
The arguments given above and (3.44b) lose their validity if the potential
behaves like a Dirac δ-function.
3.2.2 The Potential Step
As an example of a problem of the type just discussed, we study the potential
step (Fig. 3.5a), that is, the potential

1 , x>0
,
(3.45)
V (x) = V0 Θ(x) , Θ(x) =

where the constant V0 ≥ 0. Let us consider the Schrödinger equation separately in the regions I (x < 0) and II (x > 0):

The continuity requirements for ψ and ψ  will give us relations between the
free constants of the solutions in the regions I and II. We distinguish the cases
E > V0 and E < V0 , since they correspond to diﬀerent physical situations.

Suppose that the particle is incident from the left2 ; the wave function in
region I is then the superposition of a wave incident from the left, whose
amplitude can be set to unity without loss of generality, and a reﬂected wave,
whereas in region II it is a transmitted wave:

so that

(3.49)

In order to give these coeﬃcients a physical interpretation, we compute the
probability current density in the regions I and II by (2.59):

[(e−ikx + R∗ eikx )(ik)(eikx − R e−ikx ) − c.c.]

jII (x) =

where “c.c.” stands for “complex conjugate”. Here, we have decomposed the
current densities in regions I and II into incident, reﬂected, and transmitted current densities. Hence, one obtains for the reﬂection and transmission
coeﬃcients r and t:
jI (x) =

Although we solve just the time independent Schrödinger equation, we use the
terminology incoming, reﬂected and transmitted waves. This is justiﬁed, if one
2
recalls the time dependence e−k t/2m of the stationary states. Furthermore, one
can build wave packets (see Sect. 3.7.2), which behave in the following manner.
Initially there is a wave packet incident from the left, which after having reached
the barrier splits into a transmitted and reﬂected packet. It should also be mentioned that in addition to (3.48), there are solutions representing waves incident
from the right.

(3.51)

Remarks:
(i)

The particle is reﬂected with probability r. Classically, on the other
hand, there would be no reﬂection, but rather to the right of the step
the particle would just continue to move, albeit with smaller velocity.
This reﬂection is a wave phenomenon analogous to the reﬂection of light
at the boundary surface of media with diﬀerent indices of refraction.
(ii) In the limiting case E → ∞ (E  V0 ), one obtains
q → k: R → 0

, T →1 ,

i.e., the reﬂected wave vanishes. Since here we are confronted with an
inﬁnitely sharp potential step, the Ehrenfest theorem, and hence the
transition to the classical case, is not valid until E → ∞, i.e., λ → 0,
is satisﬁed. If the transition from zero to V0 were to occur continuously over a length d, particles with k  1/d would then be completely
transmitted. This can be veriﬁed explicitly in the case of the potential
V (x) = V0 (1 + tanh (x/2d))/2, which leads to hypergeometric functions.
(iii) Conservation of particle number: From (3.49) follows
q 2
k
(1 − |R|2 ) =
|T |
m
m

,

and hence
jI = jII

,

so that
jin = jreﬂ + jtrans

;

i.e., the incident particle ﬂux is equal to the sum of the transmitted and
the reﬂected particle ﬂux. This result also follows from the continuity
equation (2.60) (particle number conservation), which gives ∂j(x)/∂x =
0, since (x) is time independent.
(iv) Eq. (3.49) implies R > 0, i.e., the reﬂected and the incoming wave are
in phase. However,
if the potential step descends towards the right, i.e.,
V0 < 0, then q = 2m(E + |V0 |)/ in Eqs. (3.48) and (3.49) and hence
R < 0. In this case the reﬂected wave experiences a phase jump π.
We show the real and imaginary part of ψ(x) and the probability density
|ψ(x)|2 in Fig. 3.6. For the incident energy, we choose E = 4V0 /3; the ratio
of the wave numbers is then q/k = 1/2.

3.2.2.2 Particle Energy Below the Potential Step
E < V0 , Fig. 3.5c)
Now let the energy E of the particle incident from the left be smaller than the
height V0 of the potential step. The Schrödinger equation (3.46a) or (3.47a)
in region I then remains unchanged and is solved as in the case E > V0
by (3.48a). In region II, on the other hand, (3.47b) is replaced by

ψ  = κ2 ψ , with κ = 2m(V0 − E)/ ,
(3.52)
whose solutions either increase or fall exponentially. However, we do not need
to ﬁnd the solutions of (3.47a) and (3.52) together with continuity conditions
all over again; we need only observe that q in (3.47b–3.49) becomes purely
imaginary:
q = iκ

.

from (3.56) or from jII = 0.

3.2.2.3 The Limiting Case of an Inﬁnitely High Potential Step
(V0 → ∞)
We now consider the important limiting case of an inﬁnitely high potential
step V0 → ∞. In this case, one has
κ→∞ , T =0

, R = −1 .

Hence,
ψI (x) = eikx − e−ikx

,

and thus
ψI (0) = 0 .
This yields the general boundary condition at an inﬁnitely high step (Fig.
3.7b):
ψ|step = 0

3.3 The Tunneling Eﬀect, the Potential Barrier
3.3.1 The Potential Barrier
We now investigate motion in the presence of the square potential barrier
V (x) = V0 Θ(a − |x|)

(3.59)

shown in Fig. 3.8a. We consider only the case E < V0 . A classical particle then
would be completely reﬂected from the barrier. After seeing in the preceding
section that, in quantum mechanics, particles can slip part way into the
classically forbidden region, we should not be surprised that particles can
even penetrate through to the other side of the barrier. Assuming E < V0 ,
one obtains the Schrödinger equation (3.47a) outside the potential barrier
(|x| > a) and (3.52) inside the barrier (|x| < a). The general form of the
solution is thus

A classical particle would be reﬂected from the barrier for E < V0 . In contrast,
according to quantum theory, we even ﬁnd a ﬁnite transmission probability
in this case, described by (3.70) and (3.72). This purely quantum mechanical
phenomenon is known as the tunneling eﬀect. Important examples of the tunneling eﬀect are alpha decay of nuclei (see Sect. 3.3.3) and the cold emission
of electrons from metals.

3.3.2 The Continuous Potential Barrier
In realistic tunneling processes, the potential has a continuous shape, as illustrated in Fig. 3.9a. The probability of tunneling through this potential barrier
can be calculated approximately with the help of (3.72) by approximating
V (x) between a and b by N individual square barriers of width dx. The step
width 2a is now to be replaced by dx (Fig. 3.9b). The total transmission
probability is then the product

3.3.3 Example of Application: α-decay
The potential of an α-particle in a nucleus has approximately the shape
shown in Fig. 3.10. Here, the range of the nuclear force is R ≈ 10−12 cm, the
charge number of an α-particle is Z2 = 2, and the nuclear charge number
of the daughter nucleus is Z1 . In the classical case, energy would have to
be supplied to the particle in order for it to climb over the Coulomb barrier
and leave the nucleus. Quantum mechanically, one obtains a ﬁnite tunneling
probability, which can be calculated using (3.73) by setting V (x) ∼
= Z1 Z2 e2 /x
between the classical turning points. The limits of integration are a = R,

This does not yet suﬃce to determine the decay probability: one must also
take into account how often the particle is able to tunnel, i.e., how often it
“collides” with the nuclear surface. As a semiclassical estimate of the decay
probability, we suppose: decay probability per second = frequency of wall
collisions × transmission coeﬃcient = (vi /2R)|S(E)|2 . Here, vi is the speed of
the α-particle in the interior of the nucleus, an only vaguely deﬁned quantity.

and R is about 10−12 cm, and thus the quantity log10 (0.69R/vi ) varies only
slightly from nucleus to nucleus and may be replaced by the constant −28.9.

(or rather heavy hydrogen, i.e., deuterium and tritium)

Josephson eﬀect, that is, the tunneling of Cooper pairs in superconductors.

3.4 The Potential Well
Let us now determine the bound states of the potential well
V (x) = −V0 Θ(a − |x|)

(3.77)

(Fig. 3.12). The potential well serves as a model for short-range forces such
as those found in nuclear physics or at screened defects in solids.
The tendency to bind a particle will certainly grow with the depth and
width of the potential well and the particle mass. A dimensionless parameter
constructed from V0 , a, and m which characterizes the strength is

ζ = 2mV0 a/ .
(3.78)

Fig. 3.12. The potential well

As in the preceding sections, one considers the Schrödinger equation for regions of diﬀerent potential strength separately. Since the energies of the bound
states lie in the interval
−V0 ≤ E ≤ 0

we have

In order to guarantee the normalizability of the wave function in the region |x| > a, one chooses from the two fundamental solutions e± κx the
one that falls oﬀ exponentially. Inside the well, the solutions are oscillatory:
cos qx, sin qx, and possibly linear combinations of these two fundamental solutions. However, the reﬂection symmetry of the potential (3.77) strongly
suggests seeking solutions that are purely even,

Later we will show generally, in Sects. 3.5 and 3.6, that the bound states for
a reﬂection symmetric potential are either even or odd. From the continuity conditions (3.44a–c) for the wave function and its derivative, we obtain
transcendental equations for the energy eigenvalues E and the amplitudes A
in (3.81) and (3.82). We consider even and odd solutions in turn.

where the dimensionless parameter ζ introduced in (3.78) enters. By (3.79),

(3.85)

Equation (3.84 ) is the transcendental equation mentioned above for the wave
number q, or, by (3.80b), for the binding energy E. It can easily be solved
graphically (Fig. 3.13). Here, tan z and (ζ 2 − z 2 )1/2 /z are plotted for three
values of ζ against z ≡ qa. The permitted values of z are found from the
intersections of these two curves. For these values qa, the energy eigenvalues
according to (3.80b) are then

can be read oﬀ from the value of ζ and is

where [α] is the nearest natural number greater than α.
(ii) Thus, in any case, there is always an even bound state for ζ > 0; the
number of even bound states grows with increasing ζ according to (3.87).

that is, the potential must exceed a minimum strength. Of course, the connection between the wave number determined from (3.89) and the energy is
also given for odd states by (3.86). We can now summarize our results for
even and odd states in Table 3.2. We give the wave number interval, the
symmetry, and the number of nodes, i.e., the zeros of the corresponding wave
function. The sequence of states terminates at the (ne + no − 1)th excited
state. Even and odd states alternate with increasing energy and number of
nodes. We can evidently number the states with the number of nodes. In the
next section we will show in general that the bound states for a symmetric
potential can be represented by real even and odd functions. Once we have
found all of these, we then know all the bound states for the potential well.

We illustrate our results in Fig. 3.15 for a potential of strength ζ = 5.
Here, according to (3.87) and (3.90), there are [ζ/π] = 2 even and 2 odd
solutions.
Finally, let us consider the limit of an inﬁnitely deep potential well,
V0 → ∞. Then ζ → ∞, and the solutions of (3.84 ) and (3.89) (the intersections in Figures 3.13 and 3.14) move to the asymptotes of tan qa and
cot qa. Thus the even states are
ϕq (x) = Θ(a − |x|) cos qx with qa = (s + 12 )π

3. One-Dimensional Problems

Now that we have solved a few special, characteristic problems, in the
next two sections we would like to investigate what general conclusions can
be drawn about stationary states.

3.5 Symmetry Properties
3.5.1 Parity
The parity operator (reﬂection operator) P is deﬁned by
P f (x) = f (−x) .

(3.95)

Evidently, the even and odd functions are eigenfunctions of P with eigenvalues ± 1 (see (3.100)). We now assume that the potential is reﬂection symmetric,
P V (x) = V (x)

.

(3.96)

Since the kinetic energy contains only a second derivative, for any complex
function f (x) one has
P Hf (x) = Hf (−x) = HP f (x) ,
i.e., P and H commute, so that
[P, H] = 0

(3.97)

for symmetric potentials. If we now consider the time independent Schrödinger equation
Hψ(x) = Eψ(x)

,

(3.98)

then upon applying P it follows that
Hψ(−x) = Eψ(−x) ,
so that both ψ(x) and ψ(−x) are solutions with the same eigenvalue E. By
forming the sum and the diﬀerence of these two equations, we see that
ψe/o (x) = ψ(x) ± ψ(−x)

(3.99)

are eigenfunctions of H as well, with eigenvalue E. Since
P ψe/o = ± ψe/o

,

(3.100)

they are also eigenfunctions of P .
It thus follows that for symmetric potentials we can choose a basis of stationary states consisting only of even and odd states. If an energy eigenvalue
is nondegenerate, then the corresponding eigenfunction is automatically even
or odd.

3.6 General Discussion of the One-Dimensional Schrödinger Equation

77

3.5.2 Conjugation
If we take the complex conjugate of the time independent Schrödinger equation, we get
Hψ ∗ (x) = Eψ ∗ (x)

.

(3.101)

Combining (3.98) and (3.101), one sees that ψ + ψ ∗ and (ψ − ψ ∗ )/i are
real eigenfunctions with eigenvalue E. If, as always assumed, the potential is
real, then one can always choose real eigenfunctions. Nondegenerate energy
eigenfunctions are, aside from trivial factors, automatically real.

3.6 General Discussion
of the One-Dimensional Schrödinger Equation
In this section, we would like to discuss the one-dimensional Schrödinger
equation for a general potential in order to see to what extent the properties
found for our model potentials (oscillator, potential well, etc.) are generally
valid. We will base our considerations on a qualitative, mostly graphical discussion of the solutions of the Schrödinger equation, in order to underscore
the key elements. It should be clear from the discussion that this argumentation could also be presented in the form of an analytic proof.
For clarity, we rewrite the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation:
2m
d2 ψ
= 2 (V (x) − E)ψ(x)
2
dx


.

(3.102)

If for example we are presented with the continuous, short-range potential of
Fig. 3.17, there can be regions with E larger or smaller than V (x). These are
associated with diﬀerent solution elements.

Fig. 3.17. A symmetric short range potential

3. One-Dimensional Problems

V (x) − E > 0 . Then ψ  has the same sign as ψ, i.e., ψ is convex to the
x-axis, that is, curved away from the x-axis (Fig. 3.18a).

Fig. 3.18. Solution elements
of the Schrödinger equation
in regions with
V (x) − E > 0

V (x) − E < 0 . Here, the sign of ψ  is opposite to that of ψ, and the wave
function ψ is concave to the x-axis (Fig. 3.18b).

Fig. 3.18b. Solution elements of the
Schrödinger equation in regions with
V (x) − E < 0

The solutions of the Schrödinger equation are constructed from the elements of Fig. 3.18a and 3.18b in a continuous and continuously diﬀerentiable
manner.
Let us now consider the potential of Fig. 3.17 and the possible solutions
of the Schrödinger equation (3.102) for diﬀerent values of E.
I. E < Vmin . Then the case V (x) − E > 0 would be realized everywhere,
and the solution would diverge at inﬁnity. For E < Vmin , there is thus no
acceptable solution.
II. Vmin < E < 0 . Here, we are in the domain of the bound states. In
Fig. 3.19, we show a typical bound state of this sort. The horizontal line
E intersects the potential at the turning points TP (shown dotted). Outside of the turning points, the solution is curved away from the x-axis,
while inside of the turning points the solution is curved toward the xaxis. Roughly speaking, the solution outside the turning point has the form

state for the potential of

e± κx with κ = [2m(V (x) − E)]1/2 /, and inside the form − cos qx with
q = [2m(E − V (x))]1/2 /. If we increase the energy, the turning points shift
outwards. The function which then results, ψ(x)(x > 0), is curved away less
in the outer region from, and in the inner region more strongly toward, the
x-axis. The problem of ﬁnding bound states now consists in combining symmetrically or antisymmetrically solutions that fall oﬀ exponentially at inﬁnity
(Sect. 3.5) in such a way that ψ and ψ  are continuous at the origin. We draw
the resulting solution sequences for four values of E in the interval [Vmin , 0]
in Fig. 3.20. The value of E increases from (a) to (d), whilst the turning
points shift outward. First of all, it is clear that for E = Vmin the two turning
points coincide at the origin, and the continuity conditions cannot be fulﬁlled. Figure 3.20a corresponds to the situation where E is somewhat larger
than Vmin . The negative curvature in the region inside of the turning points
does not yet suﬃce to bring the derivative of the solution to the same value,
namely 0, at the origin, and as for the value of ψ to the right of the origin,
it is nowhere near being coincident with the dashed curve to the left of the
origin. If E is raised, we ﬁnally get to Fig. 3.20b. Here, the solid curves to the
left and right have the same slope and value at the origin. It is clear that one
reaches this situation for any potential, no matter how weak, as long as E
gets suﬃciently close to E = 0. Thus, there always exists a bound state. This
state is symmetric. If one further increases the energy above E of Fig. 3.20b,
one arrives at Fig. 3.20c. The wave function in the interior has been curved
so strongly downward that the derivatives of the solid branches on the left

and right are diﬀerent. This is not an allowable wave function. If the potential is suﬃciently strong, then upon additional raising of E the situation of
Fig. 3.20d is ﬁnally reached, in which ψ vanishes at the origin and the dashed
curve, together with the curve on the right, gives a continuous, diﬀerentiable
solution. This is the ﬁrst excited state with one node. Clearly such a state
does not exist if the potential is too weak. In the case of a strong potential
there can be further states in which alternately solid and dashed curves ﬁt
together.5
We can summarize these considerations as follows:
(i) There exists at least one bound state ψ0 ; it has no zeros.
(ii) The spectrum of the bound states is discrete.
(iii) The bound states are nondegenerate.
(iv) To the extent that the potential possesses multiple bound states, they
are alternately symmetric and antisymmetric with increasing energy.
The state ψn , n = 0, 1, . . . has n nodes.
Remark: We state without proof that for potentials V (x) behaving at large distances like limx→∞ V (x) ∼ −1/xs , one has: For s < 2, the energy eigenvalues have
a point of accumulation for E = 0. For s > 2, E = 0 is not a point of accumulation; the next bound state is located at a ﬁnite distance from 0. If the potential is
singular for small distances like limx→0 V (x) = −1/xr , then for r < 2, the energy
spectrum is bounded from below, and for r > 2, the energy spectrum goes on to
−∞.

We now continue with the discussion of the potential from Fig. 3.17 in the
energy region E > 0.
III. E > 0 . In the regions outside the potential (V (x) = 0) we can write the
solution as
ψI = eikx + R e−ikx

(3.103a)

on the left and
ψII = T eikx

(3.103b)

on the right. In the domain of the potential, the solution is more complicated;
the eﬀective wave number is larger than k there. Since two constants R and T
are available to us, however, it is possible for each k to achieve the following:
the solutions resulting from ψI and ψII match in a continuously diﬀerentiable
way at x = 0.
The energy of this scattering solution is E = (k)2 /2m. Finally, if we
recall that reﬂection of the solution given by (3.103a,b) gives rise to another
solution, we can summarize: For each E > 0, there are two stationary states.
5

For the potential in Fig. 3.17 this is the solution shown in Fig. 3.19 and also a
solution having three nodes.

3.7 The Potential Well, Resonances

81

In general, the reﬂection amplitude diﬀers from zero, R = 0. Only for particular potentials is R = 0 for all k. These reﬂectionless potentials have a very
intimate connection to the solitons of classical mechanics (see Problem 3.6
and Sect. 19.2.1). In the case of resonances, R → 0 can occur for particular kvalues. A wave packet, which represents the superposition of many k-values,
will be partially reﬂected even in this domain.

3.7 The Potential Well, Resonances
We now return to the potential well described by (3.77) and Fig. 3.12. We
treated bound states (−V0 < E < 0) in Sect. 3.4. We found that a ﬁnite
potential well has a ﬁnite number of bound states.
It remains for us to derive and discuss the stationary states for E > 0,
the scattering states. We ﬁnd these immediately from Sect. 3.3 by replacing
V0 by −V0 in the stationary solutions for the potential barrier. The wave
number in the exterior remains
√
k = 2mE/ .
(3.104)
Now, in the interior of the potential, the solution is oscillatory too, and κ
should be replaced by κ = iq, where

(3.105)
q = 2m(E + V0 )/ ,
which is the wave number in the interior. Then, by (3.60), the solution is
composed of the following elements: In the interior, we have
ψ(x) = C e−iqx + D eiqx for |x| ≤ a

.

To the left of the potential well, ψ(x) = ψin (x)+ψr (x), the sum of an incident

right. From (3.69), S(E) becomes with cosh (iq) = cos q and sinh (iq) = i sin q
S(E) =

holds for the reﬂection coeﬃcient .
Next, we would like to investigate the properties of the transmission coeﬃcient more thoroughly. First of all, one sees that |S(E)|2 is restricted to
the interval [0,1]. The transmission is equal to 1 and is thus maximal for
2qa = n π

(3.111)

where n is an integer and large enough so that ER > 0. For particles with this
incident energy, the potential is completely penetrable. Minima of the transmission coeﬃcient are found approximately at 2qa = (2n + 1) π/2, because
here sin2 (2qa) = 1. They thus lie approximately on the curve

We recall the inﬁnitely deep potential well of Sect. 3.4. Comparison of (3.110)
and (3.111) with (3.94b) and (3.86) shows that the energies of the maxima
of the transmission coeﬃcients coincide with the energy eigenvalues of the
inﬁnitely deep potential well. For a deep well, i.e., ζ  1 and E  V0 , the
maxima and minima are strongly pronounced. The maxima of the transmission coeﬃcients are known as resonances. We can understand the resonance
phenomenon qualitatively using our knowledge of reﬂection at a step: The
wave ψin , incident from the left, penetrates into the potential, changing its
wave vector and its amplitude, and is reﬂected at x = +a. Because 4aq = 2πn,

3.7 The Potential Well, Resonances

83

the incident and reﬂected wave are in phase, whereas the wave reﬂected at
−a makes a phase jump π (R < 0, see remark iv on page 61). Thus, the wave
reﬂected at −a and the waves reﬂected again and again at a are out of phase
and interfere destructively.
In Fig. 3.21 we have displayed |S(E)|2 as a function of E for two values of
the strength ζ. One sees from the ﬁgure and from (3.108) that for large ζ the
resonances become narrower or “sharper”. The n-values of the resonances,
according to (3.110) and (3.111), for ζ = 6, are n = 4, 5, . . . , and for the
stronger potential ζ = 370, they are n = 236, 237, . . . . We note here that
for potentials of the kind shown in Fig. 3.26, the resonances are even more
pronounced. We will encounter these again in Chap. 18 when scattering is
discussed.

3.7.1 Analytic Properties of the Transmission Coeﬃcient
We now turn to the properties of S(E) in the complex E-plane. In order to
ﬁnd the poles of S(E), we must set the denominator to zero, which leads to the
condition cos 2qa = (i/2)(q/k + k/q) sin 2qa. With the identity cot (2qa) =
(cot qa − tan qa)/2 the condition for a pole becomes
cot qa − tan qa =

iq

.

(3.112)

This equation is of the form f − f −1 = g − g −1 , and it is satisﬁed if and only
if either

or

(3.113b)

holds.

84

3. One-Dimensional Problems

For E > 0, i.e., for real k and q, there are no solutions of (3.113). If
E < −V0 , and thus k and q are both pure imaginary, there are no solutions
either. The region −V0 √< E < 0 remains, in which k is imaginary and q is
real. With E = |E|eiϕ , E = |E|1/2 eiϕ/2 , one obtains for E < 0, i.e., ϕ = π,
(2m|E|)1/2
.

Therefore (3.113a,b) take the form
k=i

tan qa =

(2m|E|)1/2

and cot qa = −

,

which we are already familiar with from the potential well (3.84) and (3.89)
as conditions for the energy eigenvalues of even and odd bound states.
S(E) thus has a pole at the positions of the bound states Eb of the
potential well, i.e., it goes to inﬁnity there. For this property of S(E) there is
a plausible interpretation as well. Because of the pure imaginary wave number
k, the amplitude A of the incident wave must go to zero for negative energy;
otherwise, ψin would be divergent for x → −∞. However, since S(Eb ) =
∞ one still has for energy Eb a “reﬂected” wave for x < −a and and a
“transmitted” wave for x > a, which now falls oﬀ exponentially because of
the imaginary k. In the region of the potential, a ﬁnite wave function is then
present even without an incident wave ψin , representing the bound state (see
Fig. 3.22).

Fig. 3.22. The wave function of a
bound state: For E → Eb such that,
for A → 0, AS(E) remains ﬁnite,
one obtains the bound states at the
poles of S(E) along the negative real
axis

Let us now consider S(E) near the resonances ER :
S(E) e2ika =

cos 2qa 1 − (i/2)((q/k) + (k/q)) tan 2qa

below the positive real axis ( E = |E|

E = |E| e2πi ), S(E), as a function of E, also possesses this branch cut along
the positive real axis. The poles which are related to the resonances belong
to the analytic continuation of S(E) into the second Riemannian sheet.

The analytic properties of S(E) are summarized in Fig. 3.23. In the ﬁrst
Riemannian sheet, S(E) has poles at the binding energies of the potential
well, and in the second Riemannian sheet it has poles at the energy values
ER − iΓ/2, which lead to the resonances on the positive real axis. The precise
determination of the poles of S(E) – which can be achieved by continuing

that the real part of the poles is displaced somewhat to the left with respect

Now we take again E as real. Near resonance, the transmission coeﬃcient
becomes, with (3.119),
|S(E)|2 =

(3.120)

This function is called the Lorentz curve or Breit–Wigner function. It is
shown in Fig. 3.24. Comparison with the exact form in Fig. 3.21 shows that
the scattering amplitude in the resonance region is represented very precisely
by (3.120). The width of the resonance is determined by Γ . The quantity
S(E) can also be described by a real amplitude and a phase:

The quantity δ(E), shown in Fig. 3.25, gives the phase shift of the transmitted

Here as well, the amplitude and phase show the typical behavior near resonance which is familiar from phenomena of classical mechanics and electrodynamics.

3.7 The Potential Well, Resonances

87

On the basis of our earlier physical considerations, it is clear that resonances also occur for more general potentials, for which one can derive (3.119)
and (3.122) in an analogous fashion. We would now like to investigate how
a particle whose energy is near a resonance behaves under the inﬂuence of
such a potential.
3.7.2 The Motion of a Wave Packet Near a Resonance
Let the wave packet incident on the potential be given as the superposition
of plane waves by

g(p) exp
(px − E(p)t) , E(p) = p2 /2m (3.123)
ψin (x, t) =



(the integration is performed only from 0 to ∞, since for x < −a only plane
waves propagating to the right (p > 0) should be superposed). Assuming
that g(p) has a maximum at the value p0 with E(p0 ) ≈ ER , it follows for the
velocity and the position of the maximum of ψin (x, t) that
v0 = p0 /m , x(t) = v0 t

.

(3.124)

According to (3.106d) and (3.120 ), the transmitted wave packet then has the
form (p = k)

(3.127)

We can read oﬀ the time the particle spends in the potential well from the
contributions to (3.127). The ﬁrst term corresponds to free motion without
a potential. The second term corresponds to the inﬁnitely fast transmission
through the potential which would be applicable to a classical particle in a
very deep potential. Finally the last term divided by v0 gives the time spent

88

3. One-Dimensional Problems

barrier

in the well. Just at the resonance E(p0 ) = E(pR ), it is 2/Γ. For sharp
resonances, as in the potential of Fig. 3.26b, the time spent is very large, and
the resonance becomes similar to a bound state. Hence one calls 2/Γ the life
time of the resonance. In the potential well considered previously for which
the resonances are not particularly
sharp, it follows from (3.118) with the

back
“internal velocity” vi = 2/m(ER + V0 )1/2 that the particle oscillates

and forth in the potential region about (vi 2/Γ )/4a ≈ (1/4) 1 + V0 /ER
times, before it ﬁnally leaves this region due to its positive energy.
Equation (3.127) describes the maximum of the wave packet if the phase
δ(E) does not vary too strongly over the extension of the packet, i.e., when the
spread of the wave packet is small compared to the resonance. In the more
interesting case in which the resonance is much sharper than the incident
wave packet g(p), (3.126) gives only the average position to the right of
the potential. Because of the sharp resonance, the packet is very strongly
deformed. We will discuss this at the end of this section. First, we would
like to discuss several physical applications based on the results thus far.
There are a large number of examples of such quantum mechanical resonance
phenomena.
In nuclear physics, for example, when Pb206 nuclei are bombarded with
α-particles of energy Eα = 5.4 MeV, the element Po210 is formed, which
decays again by α-emission with a half-life of 138 days, corresponding to a
width Γ of 3.8 × 10−23 eV (Fig. 3.26).
Resonances also play an important role in elementary particle physics. In
the scattering of pions from nucleons, π + N → N∗ → π + N, corresponding
to the maximum of the scattering cross section, a temporary bound state of
width Γ ≈ 120 MeV or lifetime τ ≈ 0.5 × 10−23 s (Fig. 3.27) is formed. The
resonance can be identiﬁed with an elementary particle of ﬁnite lifetime. The
J/ψ-particle was discovered in 1974 as a very sharp resonance with the mass

Fig. 3.28. The scattering cross section for hadron production in electron–
positron scattering as a function of the
center of mass energy Ecm of e− and e+ .
The resonance J/ψ represents a bound
state of quarks with the quantum number “charm”

3.1 GeV by Ting in the elementary particle reaction p + p → e+ + e− + X and
by Richter in the elementary particle reaction e+ + e− → hadrons (Fig. 3.28).
Here, one is dealing with orthocharmonium cc̄, the bound state of one quark
and one antiquark with the quantum number “charm”.
We now return to (3.125). We would like to determine the precise form of
the transmitted wave packet. Here, we assume that the wave packet overlaps
with only one of the resonances and that the width Γ of this resonance is
much narrower than the extension of the wave packet. Then g(p) is practically
constant in the region over which the resonance
extends, and we can replace
√
g(p) by g(pR ) (Fig. 3.29), where pR = 2mER . We further substitute for
S(E) the Breit–Wigner formula (3.119):

However, since the denominator in the integrand grows with |E −ER | and the
exponential function oscillates strongly with E at great distances from ER ,
we extend the integration from −∞ to +∞ for mathematical convenience,
without making an unacceptably large error. Thus, we ﬁnally obtain

potential with a ﬁnite lifetime /Γ ; its energy uncertainty is ΔE ≈ Γ/2. We
will encounter the relation between energy and time uncertainty of a state in

4. The Uncertainty Relation

4.1 The Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation
4.1.1 The Schwarz Inequality
Theorem 1. For the scalar product of two wave functions, the Schwarz
inequality
|(ϕ, ψ)|2 ≤ (ϕ, ϕ)(ψ, ψ)

(4.1)

holds.
Proof:
(i) For ϕ = 0, the inequality is obviously satisﬁed.
(ii) For ϕ = 0, we decompose ψ into a part parallel to ϕ and a part perpendicular to ϕ : ψ = zϕ + χ with (ϕ, χ) = 0. It then follows that (ϕ, ψ) =
z(ϕ, ϕ), and thus for the proportionality factor z = (ϕ, ψ)/(ϕ, ϕ). Furthermore,
(ψ, ψ) = (zϕ + χ, zϕ + χ) = z ∗ z(ϕ, ϕ) + (χ, χ) ≥ z ∗ z(ϕ, ϕ) .
Substitution of z gives
(ψ, ψ) ≥

|(ϕ, ψ)|2
q.e.d.
(ϕ, ϕ)

The equal sign holds only for χ = 0, i.e., for ψ = zϕ.
4.1.2 The General Uncertainty Relation
Let two Hermitian operators H1 and H2 and an arbitrary state ψ be given.
We deﬁne the operators Ĥi by subtracting from Hi the expectation value in
the state ψ:
Ĥi = Hi − Hi = Hi − (ψ, Hi ψ) ,
and we substitute Ĥ1 ψ and Ĥ2 ψ into the Schwarz inequality (4.1):

(4.2)

98

4. The Uncertainty Relation

(Ĥ1 ψ, Ĥ1 ψ)(Ĥ2 ψ, Ĥ2 ψ) ≥ |(Ĥ1 ψ, Ĥ2 ψ)|2

(4.1 )

.

Using Hermiticity, we obtain
(ψ, Ĥ12 ψ)(ψ, Ĥ22 ψ) ≥ |(ψ, Ĥ1 Ĥ2 ψ)|2

.

(4.3)

By means of the anticommutator
{A, B} = AB + BA

,

(4.4)

we decompose the product Ĥ1 Ĥ2 into a Hermitian and an anti-Hermitian
part
Ĥ1 Ĥ2 = 12 {Ĥ1 , Ĥ2 } + 12 [Ĥ1 , Ĥ2 ] ,
where
{Ĥ1 , Ĥ2 }† = {Ĥ1 , Ĥ2 }
is Hermitian and
[Ĥ1 , Ĥ2 ]† = −[Ĥ1 , Ĥ2 ]
is anti-Hermitian. The expectation value of a Hermitian operator is real, that
of an anti-Hermitian operator is purely imaginary. The decomposition of an
operator into Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts implies for the expectation
value a decomposition into real and imaginary parts:
|(ψ, Ĥ1 Ĥ2 ψ)|2 = 14 (ψ, {Ĥ1 , Ĥ2 }ψ)2 + 14 |(ψ, [Ĥ1 , Ĥ2 ]ψ)|2

.

(4.5)

Since expectation values Hi are ordinary numbers, one has
[Ĥ1 , Ĥ2 ] = [H1 , H2 ] ,
and it thus follows from (4.5) that
|(ψ, Ĥ1 Ĥ2 ψ)|2 ≥ 14 |(ψ, [H1 , H2 ]ψ)|2

.

(4.6)

The uncertainty ΔA is deﬁned as the root-mean-square deviation, i.e., the
positive square root of the mean-square deviation (also called variance), which
in turn is deﬁned by
(ΔA)2 = (ψ, (A − A )2 ψ)

.

(4.7)

Thus we obtain from (4.3) and (4.6) for the product of the uncertainties
ΔH1 ΔH2 ≥ 12 | [H1 , H2 ] | .

(4.8)

This inequality represents the general formulation of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for noncommuting operators. An important special case of
(4.8) is the position–momentum uncertainty relation

Remark: Under what conditions does the product of the uncertainties attain a
minimum?
In the Schwarz inequality (4.1 ), the equal sign holds when
Ĥ2 ψ = z Ĥ1 ψ

.

(4.10)

The equal sign in the estimate of Ĥ1 Ĥ2  in (4.6) holds when the expectation value
of the anticommutator vanishes:
(ψ, Ĥ1 Ĥ2 ψ) + (ψ, Ĥ2 Ĥ1 ψ) = 0

.

Substitution of (4.10) leads to
0 = (ψ, Ĥ1 z Ĥ1 ψ) + (z Ĥ1 ψ, Ĥ1 ψ) = (z + z ∗ )(Ĥ1 ψ, Ĥ1 ψ)

,

that is, z must be pure imaginary. Substituting into (4.10), one ﬁnds that the
condition for the state ψ to minimize the uncertainty product ΔH1 ΔH2 is
Ĥ2 ψ = iλĤ1 ψ

, λ real

results. The solution of this equation is a Gaussian wave packet. At the initial time,
this has a minimal uncertainty product. Depending on the potential, it disperses
more or less rapidly, deforms, and ΔxΔp will no longer be minimal. Only for the
harmonic oscillator do the minimal wave packets coincide with the coherent states
and remain minimal in the course of the time development of the system.

4.2 Energy–Time Uncertainty
The uncertainty relations considered up to now concern ﬂuctuations of observables at a particular time and result from their commutators. In addition
to these, there are also uncertainty relations concerning energy and time,
whose derivation cannot be given in this simple, formal manner. Here, Δt
usually refers to a time interval, and ΔE to the diﬀerence between energies
at times separated by Δt. In any case, one should specify precisely in what
sense these quantities are deﬁned. Since t is only a parameter in quantum
theory, and since the energy at a particular time can be measured with arbitrary precision, it is clear that energy–time uncertainty relations can only
hold in this modiﬁed sense. We would like to present a few variants of the
energy–time uncertainty relation.

100

4. The Uncertainty Relation

4.2.1 Passage Time and Energy Uncertainty
The energy uncertainty of a free wave packet is ΔE = p0 Δp/m. We deﬁne
the time uncertainty Δt as the time during which the particle can be found
at the position x, i.e., the time that a wave packet with the linear extension
Δx needs to pass through the point x:
Δt =

mΔx
Δx
=
v0
p0

.

With this, the product becomes
ΔEΔt = ΔxΔp  

.

(4.13)

The physical meaning of energy–time uncertainty is diﬀerent from that of,
e.g., position–momentum uncertainty. Position and momentum are observables to which Hermitian operators are assigned and which are measured at
a particular time t. The time merely plays the role of a parameter. The uncertainty ΔE of the dynamic variable E in the inequality (4.13) is connected
with a characteristic time interval Δt for changes in the system.
The energy–time uncertainty relation (4.13) can also be found by analyzing a wave packet at a ﬁxed position:


ϕ(p) exp
(px − Et)
ψ(x, t) =

and vice versa, i.e., the energy uncertainty ΔE and the time spent Δt at the
position x are related by (4.13). If ϕ(p) is restricted to positive momenta,
then only the “+” part contributes to ϕ̃(E, x).
4.2.2 Duration of an Energy Measurement
and Energy Uncertainty
An energy measurement with accuracy ΔE requires at least a time Δt =
/ΔE, for the following reason: The measuring time required to determine
the properties as for instance the energy distribution of a wave packet is at
least as large as the time the packet needs to pass the set up

Fig. 4.1. Momentum transfer to a pointer

Figure 4.1 shows an idealized momentum or energy measurement. The
measuring apparatus has momentum zero before the measurement; the momentum transferred to the apparatus (mass M ) in the course of the measurement is 2p. The apparatus traverses during the time T a distance 2pT /M .
In order to measure the “pointer displacement”, it must be larger than the
position uncertainty:

(p/M )

Since the energy uncertainty ΔEmeas of the measuring apparatus is proportional to the energy uncertainty ΔE of the particles (ΔEmeas ≈ ΔE), one
obtains from this inequality
ΔE T = ΔEΔt  

.

4.2.3 Lifetime and Energy Uncertainty
A connection also exists between the average lifetime τ of an excited state
(e.g., an excited atom, a radioactive nucleus, or an unstable elementary particle) and the energy width ΔE of the particle emitted in the transition:
ΔE ∼


τ

.

(4.14)

We can see this intuitively from the previous discussion if we regard the
emitted particle as a measuring apparatus which interacts with the unstable
object only during the period τ and therefore acquires the energy diﬀerence
of the “bare” (noninteracting) levels only up to the precision /τ . Quantitatively, this relation follows from time dependent perturbation theory. The
probability of a transition after the time t from energy level E to E  with the
emission of a quantum of energy ε (Fig. 4.2) is proportional to (see Sect. 16.3)

4.3 Common Eigenfunctions
of Commuting Operators
Let two Hermitian operators A and B be given. Let the ψn (x) be eigenfunctions of A with eigenvalues an . Let the state of the physical system be
described by the wave function ψ(x), which can be represented in terms of
eigenfunctions of A:

ψ(x) =
cn ψn (x) .
n

According to Sect. 2.9, in a measurement of the observable represented by A,
the probability of measuring the eigenvalue an is just |cn |2 . For cn = δnn0 ,
one measures with certainty an0 ; i.e., if the system is in an eigenstate of A,
the corresponding observable has a precise value, namely the eigenvalue.
Under what conditions are the ψn (x) eigenfunctions of B as well, and
under what conditions do A and B both have precise values?
Theorem 2. If [A, B] = 0, then A and B have a common set of eigenfunctions.
Proof:
(i) Let ψ be a nondegenerate eigenfunction of A:
Aψ = aψ

.

(4.15)

Since A and B commute,
ABψ = BAψ
and with (4.15)
A(Bψ) = a(Bψ)

.

Since ψ is the only eigenfunction of A with eigenvalue a, Bψ must be proportional to ψ. Let us denote the proportionality factor by b. The result is
then
Bψ = bψ

,

just the eigenvalue equation of the operator B.

(4.16)

(ii) Let the eigenvalue a be m-fold degenerate:
Aψj = aψj

, j = 1, . . . , m

,

(4.17a)

whereby
(ψj , ψk ) = δjk

.

(4.17b)

It then follows from the vanishing of the commutator
ABψj = BAψj
and the eigenvalue equation (4.17a) that
A(Bψj ) = a(Bψj )

.

Thus, Bψj is also an eigenfunction of A with the eigenvalue a and thus a
linear combination of the functions ψj ; i.e.,


4. The Uncertainty Relation

of the degenerate eigenfunctions ψk therefore represent eigenfunctions of both
A and B. The eigenvalues of B are given by the diagonal elements CDr of
the diagonal matrix CD .
Theorem 3. Let a complete set of eigenfunctions ψn (x), n = 1, 2 . . . of
operators A and B be given, with eigenvalues an and bn , respectively. Then
A and B commute.
Proof:
Since [A, B]ψn= (AB − BA)ψn = (an bn − bn an )ψn = 0, it follows for
arbitrary ψ = n cn ψn that
[A, B]ψ = 0
and thus
[A, B] = 0 .
From Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 it follows that observables represented by
commuting operators can simultaneously possess precise values, such that
measurements of these quantities give unique results. Examples of commuting
operators are x1 , x2 , x3 or p1 , p2 , p3 or x1 , p2 , p3 , but not x1 , p1 .
Deﬁnition 1. A complete set of eigenfunctions of the operator A is called a
basis of A.
Deﬁnition 2. (Complete set of operators or equivalently complete set of
observables.) The set of Hermitian operators A, B, . . . , M is called a complete set of operators if these operators all commute with each other and if
the common set of eigenfunctions is no longer degenerate. These eigenfunctions can then be characterized by the corresponding eigenvalues a, b, . . . , m:
ψa,b, ... ,m .
Remark: If for a given set of operators the eigenstates are still degenerate, there
exists an additional symmetry of these operators and the generator of this symmetry
operation also commutes with this set of operators.

Examples of complete sets of operators are:
–
–
–
–

for one-dimensional potentials: x or p,
for three-dimensional potentials: x, y, z or px , py , pz ,
for three-dimensional spherically symmetric potentials: x, y, z or px , py , pz
or H, L2 , Lz ,
for one-dimensional reﬂection symmetric potentials (V (x) = V (−x)): x
or p or H, P .

4.3 Common Eigenfunctions of Commuting Operators

105

The preceding theorems imply:
Theorem 4. If O is a function of the operators A, B . . . of a complete set,
then the basis of the complete set is also a basis for O.
Theorem 5. An operator O that commutes with a complete set of operators
is a function of these operators.
Since O commutes with the complete set of operators, it also has their
basis
Oψa,b ... = o(a, b, . . . )ψa,b, ...

.

Since the operator function o(A, B, . . . ) possesses the same eigenvalues
o(a, b, . . . ), it thus follows that O = o(A, B, . . . ), i.e., O is a function of
the operators A, B . . . .
We return again to the fact that commuting operators have common
eigenfunctions. In such an eigenstate they simultaneously have precise, unique
values, i.e., their eigenvalues. One refers to this by saying that “A and B are
simultaneously measurable”. In a measurement, the system is inﬂuenced, and
in general the state is changed. If we consider an observable A with
 eigencn ψn ,
functions ψn and eigenvalues an and if the state is given by ψ =
then we measure the value an with the probability |cn |2 . After this measurement, the state must have changed to ψn , because only then would any
further measurement again give an . This is called “reduction of the wave
function”. We will analyze this situation in more detail in our discussion of
the Stern–Gerlach experiment as an example of a measurement (Chap. 20).
If A and B do not commute, and if the system is in an eigenstate ψn of A,
then a measurement of A produces the value an . A subsequent measurement
of B will change the state of the system, because after an ideal measurement
whose accuracy allows the unique determination of an eigenvalue of B, the
state of the system will change to the corresponding eigenstate of B. For the
results of a further measurement of A, only probabilistic statements can be
made, which are determined by the expansion of the eigenstate of B thus
obtained in terms of eigenfunctions of A. This explains the above expression “simultaneously measurable” for commuting operators. Only if A and
B commute can sharp values be assigned to both of them simultaneously
and measurements of the corresponding observables do not disturb (interfere
with) each other. One expresses this also by saying that the two observables
are compatible.

For application to centrally symmetric potentials, we would now like to investigate properties of the angular momentum, which is also decisive in such
problems in classical mechanics.

One can show this by direct calculation. The similarity of the commutators (5.2a)–(5.2c) suggests a general reason for this structure, which we would
now like to ﬁnd. To this end, we ﬁrst show:
Theorem. The angular momentum L is the generator of rotations.

x = x + δϕ × x or xi = xi + εijk δϕj xk

.

(5.6)

This in fact represents a rotation, which proves the assertion. We would
like to illustrate this geometrically. For an arbitrary vector v, the rotated
vector is v  = v + δϕ × v. One can view the rotation actively: The vector
v is transformed by a rotation through δϕ into the vector v  (Fig. 5.2a), or
passively: The coordinate system S  results from the rotation of S through
−δϕ (Fig. 5.2b).

Fig. 5.1. Rotation about δφ

We consider the rotation to be a passive transformation. The wave function ψ(x) is transformed into the wave function ψ(x ) which lies with respect
to the coordinate system S  just as ψ(x) does with respect to S, as illustrated
by the level curves in Fig. 5.2b.

5.1 Commutation Relations, Rotations

Fig. 5.2. v1 = v1 − δϕv2 , v2 = v2 + δϕv1 (a) Active rotation; (b) passive rotation

How do the operators look in the rotated system? We begin with Aψ(x) =
ϕ(x). “Inserting” U † U = 1 and multiplying the equation by U ≡ Uδϕ on
the left, we obtain
U AU † (U ψ(x)) = U ϕ(x)

U AU † ψ(x ) = ϕ(x ) .

Thus,
A = U AU †

(5.7a)

is the operator in the rotated coordinate system, since it has the same action
on the transformed state ψ(x ) as A on ψ(x). Expanding (5.7a) up to ﬁrst
order in δϕ, it follows immediately that
i
δϕl [Ll , A] .

A few special cases are of general interest.
A = A +

(i)

(5.7b)

Let A be a scalar (rotationally invariant) operator. Then A = A, and
it follows from (5.7b) that
[Li , A] = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3 .

(5.8)

Example: rotationally invariant Hamiltonian H = p2 /2m+V (r), L2 , p2 ,
etc.
(ii) Let v be a vector operator. The quantity v transforms as a vector under
rotations according to v  = v + δϕ × v. Setting this equal to (5.7b)
component by component
vj + εjlk δϕl vk = vj +

i
δϕl [Ll , vj ]


shows
[Li , vj ] = iεijk vk

.

Examples: L, x, p.
With this, (5.2) is proven in general.

5. Angular Momentum

Remarks:
The unitary operator Uϕe = eiϕe · L generates a ﬁnite rotation about the
unit vector e through the angle ϕ. This follows by decomposition into
a sequence of inﬁnitesimal rotations about e.
(ii) Momentum and translations: We note that the momentum operator
p = (/i)∇ is the generator of translations

(i)

eia · p/ ψ(x) = ea · ∇ ψ(x) = ψ(x + a) .

(5.10)

The middle part of Eq. (5.10) represents the Taylor expansion of ψ(x+a)
around x in compact form. The wave function ψ(x) is shifted by −a.
In the coordinate system S  which is shifted by −a with respect to S,
i.e., xi = xi + ai , the wave function ψ(x + a) has the same position as
ψ(x) in S. The generators of symmetry operations are summarized in
Table 8.1.

5.2 Eigenvalues of Angular Momentum Operators
The derivations of this section require only the algebraic properties of the angular momentum (the commutation relations (5.2a)) and thus hold not only
for the orbital angular momentum, but for any angular momentum (spin,
total angular momentum). Because diﬀerent components of the angular momentum do not commute, they cannot be simultaneously diagonalized; thus,
there is no common basis for all three components. However, since L2 is a
scalar, then according to (5.8) one has
[L2 , Li ] = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3 ,

(5.11)

and thus we can diagonalize L2 and one component of L. We would now like
to determine the eigenvalues of the common eigenfunctions of L2 and Lz .
We ﬁrst deﬁne two new operators
L± = Lx ± iLy

(5.12)

with the following properties:
(L± )† = L∓

,

(5.13a)

[Lz , L± ] = iLy ± Lx = ± L±
[L+ , L− ] = −2i[Lx , Ly ] = 2Lz
[L2 , L± ] = 0 ,

,
,

(5.13b)
(5.13c)
(5.13d)

5.2 Eigenvalues of Angular Momentum Operators

111

because of (5.11),
L+ L− = L2x + L2y − i[Lx , Ly ] = L2x + L2y + Lz

,

and therefore
L2 = L2x + L2y + L2z = L+ L− − Lz + L2z = L− L+ + Lz + L2z .

(5.13e)

Now let ψlz be an eigenfunction of Lz :
Lz ψlz = lz ψlz

.

With (5.13b) we ﬁnd
Lz L± ψlz = L± Lz ψlz ± L± ψlz

,

and thus
Lz (L± ψlz ) = (lz ± )L± ψlz

.

This means that if ψlz is an eigenfunction of Lz with eigenvalue lz , then
L± ψlz is an eigenfunction of Lz with eigenvalue lz ±  or, put more brieﬂy,
L± raises (lowers) the eigenvalue lz by .
From now on we will denote the eigenfunctions of L2 and Lz by ψlm ,
where
L2 ψlm = 2 l(l + 1)ψlm
Lz ψlm = mψlm

, l ≥ 0

,

.

(5.14)

Evidently, we can represent any eigenvalue of the positive semideﬁnite operator L2 and of the operator Lz in this form. We know already that L± raises
(lowers) m by 1. From (5.13d) it further follows that
L2 (L± ψlm ) = L± L2 ψlm = 2 l(l + 1)(L± ψlm ) .
L± ψlm is thus an eigenfunction of L2 with the same eigenvalue as ψlm .
Further information can be obtained from the normalization using (5.13a),
(5.13e) and (5.14),
(L± ψlm , L± ψlm ) = (ψlm , L∓ L± ψlm ) = (ψlm , (L2 − L2z ∓ Lz )ψlm )
= 2 (l(l + 1) − m2 ∓ m) ,
where we assume that ψlm is normalized. From this it follows that

L± ψlm =  l(l + 1) − m(m ± 1)ψl,m ± 1 ,
where the phase factor is set to unity. Since the norm is non-negative,
(L± ψlm , L± ψlm ) = 2 (l(l + 1) − m(m ± 1)) ≥ 0

.

(5.15)

112

5. Angular Momentum

Therefore, the restrictions
for m > 0 : l(l + 1) ≥ m(m + 1) ,
for m < 0 : l(l + 1) ≥ m(m − 1) = (−m) (−m + 1) = |m| (|m| + 1) ,
follow, that is l(l + 1) ≥ |m|(|m| + 1) and thus |m| ≤ l.
Now let l be a ﬁxed value and M the maximal corresponding m. In order
that L+ ψlM not be an eigenfunction with the larger eigenvalue M + 1, the
condition L+ ψlM = 0 must hold. From the normalization equation above, it
follows immediately that l(l + 1) = M (M + 1) and therefore M = l. The case
where μ is the minimal m is handled analogously. In order that L− ψlμ not
be an eigenfunction with smaller eigenvalue μ − 1, L− ψlμ = 0 must hold and
thus μ = −l. Now one can obtain all the values of m recursively:
L− ψll ∼ ψl,l−1

, (L− )2 ψll ∼ ψl,l−2

, etc. ,

with eigenvalues m = l, l − 1, etc. In order for this to give −l, the equation
l − k = −l must hold, where k is a non-negative integer. With this it follows
that l = k/2. Summarizing, using only the algebraic structure of the commutation relations for angular momentum, we now obtain the following result
for the eigenvalue spectrum:
l = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . or l = 12 , 32 , 52 , . . .

(5.16)

with the corresponding values for m
m = l, l − 1, . . . − l + 1, −l

.

The angular momentum eigenvalues l are either integral or half integral, and
the eigenvalues m range in integer steps from l to −l.

5.3 Orbital Angular Momentum in Polar Coordinates
We now leave these general considerations and determine the particular eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the orbital angular momentum. Because of the
intimate connection with rotations it is advantageous to transform to spherical polar coordinates (Fig. 5.3).

Φ(ϕ) = eimϕ

.

(5.20b)

The continuity of the wave function demands Φ(ϕ + 2π) = Φ(ϕ); for this
reason, m must be an integer and, as a result, l as well, thus:
l = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .

5. Angular Momentum

What is the behavior of the Ylm (ϑ, ϕ) under reﬂection (Fig. 5.5)? The
parity operator P transforms the position vector x into −x, or, acting on
a state ψ, one has P ψ(x) = ψ(−x). The vector −x has polar coordinates
π − ϑ, ϕ + π.
Because of cos (π − ϑ) = − cos ϑ we can write
P Ylm (ϑ, ϕ) = Ylm (π − ϑ, ϕ + π) = eimπ (−1)l+|m| Ylm (ϑ, ϕ)

,

(5.35a)

or
P Ylm (ϑ, ϕ) = (−1)l Ylm (ϑ, ϕ)

.

(5.35b)

The Ylm are eigenfunctions of the parity operator with eigenvalues (−1)l ,
i.e. Ylm is even for even l and odd for odd l. By (5.30) and (5.31), the
Ylm form a complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions of the orbital angular momentum operators L2 and Lz . The eigenvalues of L2 are 2 l(l + 1)
with l = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . . For each ﬁxed value of l, there exist (2l + 1) values
m = −l, −l + 1, . . . , l for the eigenvalue of the z-component Lz of orbital angular momentum. The components Lx and Ly are not diagonal in the states
Ylm . They have expectation value zero and the uncertainties ΔLx and ΔLy ,
respectively; for the states Yll for example, one has

(5.36)
ΔLx = ΔLy =  l/2 .
From (5.36) we see
The states Yll are concentrated mainly in the xy-plane.
√
that the relative ﬂuctuation ΔLx /l decreases as 1/ l with increasing l.
States with orbital angular momentum quantum number l = 0 are known
as “s-orbitals”, states with l = 1 as “p-orbitals”, with l = 2 as “d-orbitals”
and with l = 3 as “f -orbitals”.
So-called polar diagrams are often used, in which the value of |Ylm (ϑ, ϕ)|2
= (Θ(ϑ))2 is plotted as a function of angle ϑ (Fig. 5.6); this value can be read
oﬀ from the radial distance of the curve from the origin of the diagram. Because of the ϕ-independence, such representations have rotational symmetry
about the z-axis. The diagrams for m and −m are identical (compare (5.33)).
The functions |Yll |2 (i.e., for maximal values of m!) are strongly concentrated
about the xy-plane.
Linear combinations of the states Ylm are also important. For example,
one refers to (Fig. 5.7)

6. The Central Potential I

In this chapter, we will consider motion in central potentials. We ﬁrst reduce the time independent Schrödinger equation to a one-dimensional (radial) problem. We then determine the bound states for the most important
case of an attractive Coulomb potential. Finally, we transform the two-body
problem into a one-body problem with a potential, so that our treatment of
motion in a Coulomb potential also covers the nonrelativistic hydrogen atom.

6.1 Spherical Coordinates
We now study three-dimensional motion in a central-force ﬁeld, which is
characterized by the fact that the potential energy V (r) only depends on the
distance r = |x| from the origin. The Hamiltonian takes the form
H=

1 2
p + V (r)
2m

.

(6.1)

In classical mechanics,
L2 = (x × p)2 = x2 p2 − (x · p)2

,

and thus
p2 =

L2
+ p2r
r2

holds, if pr ≡ (x/r) · p designates the radial component of the momentum.
On the other hand, in quantum mechanics the noncommutativity of
position and momentum operators must be kept in mind
L2 = x2 p2 − (x · p)2 + ix · p

.

ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ) = R(r) Ylm (ϑ, ϕ)

.

(6.8)

If this is substituted into the diﬀerential equation (6.7), then using (5.14) and
(5.21) a diﬀerential equation for the radial part R(r) immediately follows:

In the separation ansatz for the wave function, we encounter a general principle. Since H as a scalar is invariant under rotations, i.e., possesses rotational
symmetry, then according to (5.9), [H, L] = [H, L2 ] = 0, which means that
H, Lz , and L2 are simultaneously diagonalizable. As in the present situation
in which the conservation of angular momentum L follows from the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian, a continuous symmetry always leads to
a corresponding conservation law.
In any case, we now would like to continue the investigation of (6.9),
which, although it depends only on one coordinate, does not yet take the
form of a one-dimensional Schrödinger equation. In order to bring it into this
form, we substitute
R(r) = u(r)/r

(6.12)

This is in complete analogy to classical mechanics, in which the central potential is also modiﬁed by a repulsive centrifugal term (second term in (6.12)).
We now must determine boundary and normalization conditions for u(r).

Thus, u(r) must decrease for large r more strongly with r than 1/ r.
2. Behavior for r → 0 : For V (r) = δ (3) (x), the boundary condition u(0) = 0
must further hold, since otherwise Δψ = ∇2 u(0)/r ∼ δ (3) (x) u(0), in
contradiction to (6.11).

6.2 Bound States in Three Dimensions
We now pose the question of what general statements can be made concerning
the existence of bound states. Let us ﬁrst consider the orbital angular momentum l = 0, where one has Veﬀ (r) = V (r). According to (3.58), the boundary
condition u(0) = 0 means that the equivalent one-dimensional problem has
the potential (Fig. 6.2)

eigenfunctions are identical to the
odd eigenfunctions of Ṽ1 (x) (dashed )

6.2 Bound States in Three Dimensions

123

As a reference, we also deﬁne the symmetric potential Ṽ1 (x) ≡ V (|x|). We
know from Chap. 4 that symmetric, one-dimensional problems always possess
at least one even bound state. However, an odd bound state exists only if
the potential reaches a minimum strength. The ground state of the potential
V1 (x) coincides, for positive x, with the ﬁrst excited state, i.e., the lowest odd
bound state of Ṽ1 (x). Therefore, V (r) must exceed a minimum strength, in
order that in three dimensions a bound state exist. The centrifugal term is
increasingly repulsive with increasing l. If a potential has no bound state for
l = 0, then it certainly has none for l > 0.
At this point, we would like to gain further information about the behavior
of u(r) from a consideration of the radial Schrödinger equation (6.11) in
limiting cases, before we ﬁnally turn to the Coulomb problem in the next
section.
Limit r → 0
For potentials like the Coulomb potential or the square-well potential, the
centrifugal term dominates for decreasing r compared to (V (r) − E), so
that (6.11) becomes

This diﬀerential equation of second order has the general solution
u(r) = A rl+1 + B r−l

.

Because of the boundary condition u(0) = 0, the B term is not permitted, so
that in the limit r → 0 , u(r) → a0 rl+1 , and one can in general take
u(r) = rl+1 (a0 + a1 r + . . . ) .

Remark: For potentials V (r) ∼ 1/r and V (r) ∼ r (Coulomb potential, square

like to establish a connection between the radial Schrödinger equation (6.19)
with the eigenvalues we have found and a diﬀerential equation which has
been thoroughly investigated in mathematics, and we will make use of its
known solutions. For this purpose, we multiply (6.19) by 1/2 and, using (6.23)

This is the Laguerre diﬀerential equation. In order to see this, and for completeness, we insert a short overview of the most important (for our purposes)

one obtains the following recursion relation:

(6.28)

A second recursion relation results in complete analogy by partial diﬀerentiation with respect to s:
(ii) Lr+1 = (2r + 1 − x)Lr − r2 Lr−1

.

(6.29)

From the recursion relations, we note (without proof) that the Laguerre
diﬀerential equation
x Lr + (1 − x) Lr + r Lr = 0

(6.30)

follows. The associated Laguerre polynomials are given by the deﬁnition

fact that diﬀering deﬁnitions and notations are in use.

(6.34)

Now we see by comparison of (6.26) and (6.34) that the w() are solutions
of the diﬀerential equation for the associated Laguerre polynomials with
s = 2l + 1, r = n + l, that is,
w() = A L2l+1

Let us summarize: With (6.8), (6.10), (6.18), (6.35) and corresponding

The energy eigenvalues of the Coulomb Hamiltonian exhibit, as we saw
earlier, multiple degeneracy in the quantum numbers l and m. To what degree
does this depend on the special features of the physical situation investigated
here?
(a) For central potentials, i.e., whenever V = V (r), the energy eigenvalues are always independent of m.
To this end, we consider a rotationally symmetric Hamiltonian, that is
[H, Li ] = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3. In this case, H, L2 , and Lz are simultaneously
diagonalizable, i.e., they have common eigenfunctions, and in addition one
has [L± , H] = 0. Let ψ. lm be an eigenfunction3 of H : Hψ. lm = Eψ. lm . We
now operate on this equation with L+ .
HL+ ψ. lm = L+ Hψ. lm = EL+ ψ. lm

3

,

The dot refers to further quantum numbers of H, e.g. n in the case of the
Coulomb potential.

132

6. The Central Potential I

or, because
L+ ψ. lm ∝ ψ. lm+1
Hψ. lm+1 = Eψ. lm+1

,
.

However, this implies that if ψ. lm is an eigenfunction with the eigenvalue E
then this also holds for ψ. lm+1 . Thus, as a consequence of rotational symmetry, the energy eigenvalues are independent of m, as one sees in elementary
fashion on the basis of the m-independence of the radial Schrödinger equation (6.9).
(b) The degeneracy of the energy eigenvalues with respect to l represents
a speciﬁc property of the 1/r-potential.
The reason for this is that for the Coulomb potential the Lenz vector
A=

e2
1
(p × L − L × p) − 0 x
2m
r

is an additional conserved quantity (A·L = L·A = 0; [A, H] = 0). Classically
the implication of this is that the major axis of the elliptical orbit is spatially
ﬁxed.
The degree of degeneracy of the energy eigenvalues was determined earlier as n2 ; if one additionally takes into account the double occupancy of
each state by two electrons of opposite spin, this becomes 2 n2 . In line with
spectroscopic notation, we will later designate the 2 (2l + 1) states with ﬁxed
values of n and l as a “shell”.
The position expectation values and uncertainties in the eigenstates of the
Coulomb Hamiltonian are also of interest. One obtains for the expectation
value of the radial distance in the state ψnlm , using the recursion relation for
the Laguerre polynomials,

One sees that for n → ∞ , this fraction approaches 0, i.e., the orbitals are
very well deﬁned for high energies.
The states with angular momentum quantum number l = 0 are proportional to
ψn00 ∝ e−κr L1n (2κr)

.

They have n − 1 nodes and are non vanishing at r = 0 (ψn00 (0, ϑ, ϕ) = 0).
Additionally, the states ψn00 are√independent of angle, i.e., spherically symmetric, because of Y00 (ϑ, ϕ) = 1/ 4π, whereas classically motion with orbital
angular momentum L = 0 runs along a straight line through the center.

momentum, i.e. l = n − 1, have the radial dependence

orbital angular momentum L are circular. By superposition of the states
ψn,n−1,n−1 for large n, one can construct wave packets which represent exactly the classical circular orbits and fulﬁll Kepler’s third law (radius ∝ n20 ,
orbital period ∝ n30 ; see the end of this section).
Whereas L2 and Lz assume well deﬁned values in the eigenstates ψnlm ,
this is not true of the angular momentum components Lx and Ly . Because
of the symmetry properties of the ψnlm in angular coordinates, one ﬁnds for
the expectation values
Lx,y l,m = (ψnlm , Lx,y ψnlm ) = (Ylm , Lx,y Ylm ) = 0 .

In order to get a feeling for atomic orders of magnitude, we now show that
we can obtain the ground state energy and the Bohr radius by minimizing
the energy while taking into account the uncertainty relation. With the help
of the uncertainty relation, one can estimate the ground state energy without
further knowledge of what the state looks like. If in the Hamiltonian

We add a few remarks concerning the characteristic lengths that arise
in the atomic domain and their connection with the ﬁne-structure constant

(i)

the Compton wavelength

which entered in Chap. 1 in the scattering of γ-quanta from electrons,
and which also can be interpreted as the de Broglie wavelength of highly

6. The Central Potential I

From the uncertainty relation, the typical velocity of the electron in the
atom is v = Δp/m = Z/am = Zαc.
In our treatment of the Coulomb potential in the above sections, we have
occasionally referred to the hydrogen atom. To what extent is this justiﬁed?
Indeed, it turns out that in very accurate experiments, deviations were discovered which result from the following eﬀects, which will be treated in later
chapters.
(i)

First of all, the hydrogen atom is a two-body system consisting of a
nucleus of mass mN and an electron. In the next section we will show
that the transformation to center-of-mass and relative coordinates leads
to a one-body problem with the reduced mass
μ=

m
m mN
=
m + mN
1 + m/mN

.

In hydrogen, this gives a correction in the fourth decimal place, that
is, 1 + me /mN = 1.00054463, whereas for example in positronium the
change is considerable: mN = me+ = me , and therefore μ = me /2 .
(ii) Relativistic eﬀects give rise to the so-called “ﬁne structure” and are of
order α2 in comparison to the original levels. These include the relativistic correction to the electron mass, the Darwin term and the spin–orbit
coupling (Chap. 12).
(iii) The Lamb shift, a quantum electrodynamic phenomenon, is of order
α3 ln α in comparison to the original energy levels.
(iv) The hyperﬁne structure, which results from the interaction between the
electron and the nuclear spin, is smaller by a factor of about me /mN
≈ 1/2000 than the ﬁne structure.
Time dependence: circular Keplerian orbits. We now discuss the classical limit
mentioned on p. 133 more precisely and in particular we derive Kepler’s third law
of planetary motion from quantum theory. Considering our experience with the
classical limit of the harmonic oscillator at the end of Sect. 3.1, we expect that
we have to construct a superposition of states with large quantum numbers. We
restrict consideration to circular orbits. In classical mechanics, circular orbits have
the maximal allowed angular momentum corresponding to a given energy. This
means that we must superimpose states ψn,n−1,n−1 (r, ϑ, ϕ), since l = n − 1 is the
maximal angular momentum quantum number to n. Moreover, we know from (5.36)
that the orbital plane is best deﬁned for m = l, and therefore we have set m = n−1.
We thus arrive at the following superposition:
X 
cn ψn,n−1,n−1 (r, ϑ, ϕ) e −itEn / .
(6.51)
ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ, t) =
n


Suppose that the coeﬃcients cn have their maximum at some large value n0 and
are concentrated about this value. We write
n = n0 + ε

6.3 The Coulomb Potential

137

and expand the quantities occurring in (6.51) in ε, which according to the above
assumption is small compared to n0 . In particular, we obtain for the energy eigenvalues (6.24 ) of the hydrogen atom (Z = 1 and Ry = me40 /22 )

where we have used (C.9). From (6.51 ) it is again clear that for large n0 the
wave packet is completely concentrated within ϑ = π/2. We now absorb all the
normalization constants into a new expansion coeﬃcient cε and get for the radial
and angular dependence of the wave packet in the orbital plane (ϑ = π/2)

By appropriate choice of cε , e.g., a Gaussian, one obtains a wave packet having
the form ψ(r, π/2, ϕ, t) = g(ϕ − tν) with respect to azimuthal angular dependence
and circulating with the frequency ν = 2 Ry/n30 . Concerning the permissibility
of superimposing energy eigenstates with distinct principal quantum numbers, we
note that

(6.53 )

For large n0 and ε  n0 the relative uncertainty of the orbital radius is vanishingly
small.
We can summarize the result as follows. We obtain wave packets moving on
circular orbits and sharply concentrated with respect to both r and ϕ. The orbital
radius is r = an20 , and the orbital period is ν = 2 Ry/n30 . Hence, we have derived
Kepler’s third law from the classical limit of quantum mechanics. This result is of
interest for Rydberg states of the hydrogen atom. Of course, it is also instructive
to go from the Coulomb interaction to the gravitational interaction by e20 → M mG
(G is the gravitational constant, M and m are the mass of celestial bodies such as
the sun and a planet). One can apply the result to planetary motion and compute,
for example, n0 for the earth or for a satellite orbiting the earth and estimate
the aforementioned uncertainties. We have restricted consideration here to circular
orbits; the calculation of quantum mechanical wave packets in elliptical orbits turns
out to be more complicated.4

6. The Central Potential I

6.4 The Two-Body Problem
If we consider the motion of an electron about the atomic nucleus or that
of the earth about the sun, then (forgetting for the moment about other
electrons or planets) we are faced with a two-body problem. In general, the
Hamiltonian of a two-body problem involves the sum of the kinetic energies
of both particles and their interaction, which is assumed to depend only on
the separation vector:
H=

p2
p21
+ 2 + V (x1 − x2 ) .
2m1
2m2

(6.54)

Since the potential here depends only on the relative separation, one introduces relative and center-of-mass coordinates in the form
xr = x1 − x2
xcm =

; pr = μ(v 1 − v 2 ) =

m1 x 1 + m2 x 2
m1 + m2

m2 p1 − m1 p2
m1 + m2

; pcm = p1 + p2

with reduced mass
m1 m2
μ=
m1 + m2

(6.55)

(6.56a)

and total mass
M = m1 + m2

.

(6.56b)

Since [xνi , pμj ] = iδij δνμ (ν, μ = 1, 2 particle index; i, j = 1, 2, 3 Cartesian
component index), the canonical commutation relations also hold for pr , pcm
and xr , xcm :
[xri , prj ] = iδij = [xcmi , pcmj ] ,

(6.57)

while the remaining commutators of these operators vanish. It follows from
this property that the momentum operators pr and pcm satisfy
pr =

Since the potential depends only on xr , the separation ansatz
ψ(xr , xcm ) = eikcm · xcm ψ(xr )

(6.61)

brings (6.60) into the form

with the energy eigenvalues E = Ê − 2 kcm
/2M or

Ê = E +

2
2 kcm
2M

.

(6.63)

By the introduction of relative and center-of-mass coordinates, the two-body
problem has thus been successfully reduced to a one-body problem: (6.62)
corresponds precisely to the situation discussed earlier, which was represented
by the Hamiltonian (6.1). Here, we have separated oﬀ the free motion of the
2
/2M and wave function
center-of-mass with energy Ecm = 2 kcm
i
ψcm (xcm , t) = exp − Ecm t + ikcm · xcm


.

Aside from the trivial term Ecm in the energy eigenvalues Ê, a modiﬁcation of
the earlier one-particle energy eigenvalues E also enters, in that the reduced
mass μ replaces the particle mass m in (6.62). With this modiﬁcation, we can
therefore apply the results of Sect. 6.3 to the nonrelativistic hydrogen atom.
Similarly, one may start from the time dependent Schrödinger equation
i

∂
ψ(xr , xcm , t) = Hψ(xr , xcm , t)
∂t

(6.64)

and introduce the separation ansatz
ψ(xr , xcm , t) = ψr (xr , t)ψcm (xcm , t) ,

(6.65)

where ψcm (x, t) is a solution of the center of mass Schrödinger equation

7.3 The Normal Zeeman Eﬀect

145

The order of magnitude is the ﬁne-structure constant times the ratio of
B to atomic electric ﬁeld strengths. Experimentally, ﬁelds of about 105 G are
achievable. Thus, the quadratic term in A is negligible whenever Lz = 0.
Therefore, under laboratory conditions, diamagnetic eﬀects are smaller than
paramagnetic eﬀects for electrons bound in atoms. However, there do exist
situations in which the diamagnetic and paramagnetic terms can be of comparable magnitude. This is the case for metal electrons, and in particular for
free electrons a comparison of the susceptibilities for Landau diamagnetism
and Pauli paramagnetism yields
χLandau = − 13 χPauli

.

The diamagnetic term is also important in the treatment of matter under
conditions such as those prevailing on the surfaces of neutron stars: there,
ﬁelds up to 1012 gauss occur, which leads to a considerable change in the
atomic structure. (See also the end of Sect. 14.1.)
Finally, we would like to compare the paramagnetic term with the
Coulomb energy:

i.e., the change in the energy levels due to laboratory ﬁelds is very small.

hydrogen atom in a constant magnetic ﬁeld
H = H0 −

(7.5)

where the magnetic ﬁeld is chosen parallel to the z-axis. Here, H0 is the
Coulomb Hamiltonian [(−2 /2m)∇2 − e20 /r], whose eigenfunctions ψnlml we
know.2 How does the total Hamiltonian (7.5) act on ψnlml ?

2

To avoid confusion with the particle mass we use ml here for the eigenvalue of
Lz / instead of m as in previous chapters. Because of (7.7) one calls ml also the
magnetic quantum number.

is
e0 B

,

and it is independent of l.
This splitting leads to additional transitions, which, however, are restricted by the selection rule Δml = −1, 0, 1. This equidistant splitting caused
by the magnetic ﬁeld is called the “normal” Zeeman eﬀect (Fig. 7.1). Indeed,
in the hydrogen atom the splitting is completely diﬀerent, and in fact there
is an even number of levels, as if the angular momentum were half integral.
This will lead us in Chap. 9 to an additional kind of angular momentum, the
spin.

the “normal” Zeeman eﬀect

In many-electron atoms, L refers to the total angular momentum and l to
the corresponding quantum number. For historical reasons, one speaks of the
“normal” Zeeman eﬀect if the splitting is determined by the orbital angular
momentum alone and is given by (7.7). In fact, as in the hydrogen atom, the
situation is usually more complicated and cannot be explained purely by the
orbital angular momentum (the “anomalous” Zeeman eﬀect). In Chap. 14
this will be discussed in more detail.

In Appendix B, the concept of canonical and kinetic momentum from classical
mechanics is reviewed. The quantity p is the canonical momentum, whereas
e
mẋ = p − A
c

is the kinetic momentum. The corresponding operators satisfy the following
commutation relations:

The fact that the components of the kinetic momentum do not commute
among themselves has important consequences for motion in a magnetic ﬁeld.

7.4.2 Change of the Wave Function
Under a Gauge Transformation
The Lorentz force (B.3) depends only on B (see Appendix B), whereas the
Schrödinger equation (7.3) contains the vector potential A. The question thus
immediately arises as to whether the wave function ψ depends on the gauge
and whether charged particles react to B or A (possibly only to its gauge
invariant part).
To answer this question, we ﬁrst study the inﬂuence of a gauge transformation

consequences, since |ψ|2 does not change.3 Matrix elements of x and mẋ and
functions thereof remain unchanged.

However, the energy eigenvalues of extended stationary states may depend on A.

zero) in all space. (Since no electric ﬁeld acts, we have set Φ = 0. The potential
V (x) is intended to represent inﬂuences which are
 x not electric in origin.) At
this point we recall from electrodynamics that x0 ds · A(s) of Eq. (7.20b)
depends only on the end points but not on the paths, as long as the loop
formed by a pair of diﬀerent paths does not enclose a magnetic ﬂux.
7.5.2 The Aharonov–Bohm Interference Experiment
We would now like to investigate whether an electron moving only in regions
of nonvanishing A(x) but vanishing B(x) feels anything of the existence of
the magnetic ﬁeld in the inaccessible region. To this end, we now consider
the interference experiment shown in Fig. 7.3 in which the magnetic ﬁeld
is restricted to the interior of the “inﬁnitely” long coil, perpendicular to the
plane of Fig. 7.3 and depicted by a circle. It is assumed that the coil is screened
by a wall of the double slit device and thus the electrons are restricted to
the region B = 0. The lack of penetration of ψ into the ﬁeld region can be
represented formally by an inﬁnitely high potential barrier.
In order to ﬁnd the solution as a function of the ﬁeld, we determine ﬁrst
the solutions with only one slit open at a time and then linearly superimpose
them. Let ψ1,B (x) be the wave function when only slit 1 is open. By (7.23),
it can be obtained from the ﬁeld-free wave function ψ1,0 and becomes

ie
ψ1,B (x) = ψ1,0 (x) exp
ds · A(s)
,
(7.24a)
c 1
where the line integral runs from the source through slit 1 to x. Similarly,
for the wave function when only slit 2 is open, we have

interference experiment. The
electrons cannot penetrate into
the ﬁeld region (very long solenoid, perpendicular to the plane
depicted by the circle)

The Aharonov–Bohm interference oscillations were also observed recently in
normally conducting metal rings.
Summarizing: Classically, E and B are the physically relevant quantities,
since they determine the Lorentz force. In regions where E = B = 0 the particle feels no force. The potentials A and Φ serve in classical physics only as
auxiliary quantities. In quantum mechanics, A(x) is the fundamental physical ﬁeld; however, the wave function always has the property that physical
quantities and eﬀects depend only on gauge invariant quantities.

7.6 Flux Quantization in Superconductors

7.6 Flux Quantization in Superconductors
Many metals and, as discovered recently, many oxidic semiconductors become superconducting below a critical temperature Tc characteristic for each
particular substance. The electrons form Cooper pairs. We consider a typeI superconductor in the form of a hollow cylinder in an external magnetic
ﬁeld taken parallel to the axis of the cylinder. It is found experimentally (the
Meissner eﬀect) that the magnetic ﬁeld is expelled from the superconductor
and thus vanishes within it (except for a thin boundary layer). The doubly
charged Cooper pairs thus move in a ﬁeld-free region, and therefore the wave
function (7.23) can be used to describe them. If the wave function of the
Cooper pairs in the absence of a ﬁeld is given by ψ0 (x) , then in the presence
of a ﬁeld it becomes according to (7.23)

i2e x
ψB (x) = exp
ds · A(s) ψ0 (x) .

The vector potential in (7.23 ) has the property that within the superconductor curl A = 0 (i.e.,
which

 can be

shrunk to a point, ds · A(s) = 0), whereas ΦB = da · curl A = ds · A(s)


the cavity, ds · A(s) = ΦB ). A closed path about the cylinder starting at

This quantization has also been observed experimentally7 . The occurrence
of twice the electronic charge in the quantization represents an important
test of the existence of Cooper pairs, which are the basis of BCS (Bardeen–
Cooper–Schrieﬀer) theory.

7.7 Free Electrons in a Magnetic Field
We now investigate free electrons in a magnetic ﬁeld oriented in the x3 direction. The vector potential (7.4a) has only components perpendicular to
B, so that the p3 -contribution to the kinetic energy is the same as that of
free particles, and the Hamiltonian is given by
H = H⊥ +

p23
2m

.

(7.29a)

Expressed in terms of the components of the kinetic momentum (7.11), the
transverse part of the Hamiltonian takes the form
m
H⊥ = (ẋ21 + ẋ22 ) .
(7.29b)
2
The second term in (7.29a) is diagonalized by exp {ip3 x3 /}, corresponding to
free motion in the x3 -direction, which can be separated oﬀ, since p3 commutes
with the ẋi . We now turn to the transverse part, which contains the magnetic
eﬀects. For electrons, e = −e0 , and the commutation relations

with n = 0, 1, . . . . We have thus found the energy levels for free electrons
in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld – also known as Landau levels. These play
an important role in solid state physics. The problem is not yet completely
solved, since for example we have not yet determined the degeneracy and
the wave function of our particles. Formally it is clear that, beginning with
the four canonical operators x1 , x2 , p1 , p2 , we need two more operators,
in addition to π1 , π2 introduced above, for a complete characterization. In

8. Operators, Matrices, State Vectors

8.1 Matrices, Vectors, and Unitary Transformations
In the following sections, we write all relations, to the extent that a speciﬁcation is necessary at all, for one spatial dimension. All formulae can of
course be rewritten in three dimensions with the replacements x → x and
dx → d3 x.
Let a complete orthonormal set of functions {ψn (x)} and an arbitrary
operator A be given. Then the matrix representation of A in the basis {ψn (x)}
is deﬁned as
Anm = (ψn , Aψm )

.

(8.1)

The matrix Anm may be ﬁnite or, more generally, inﬁnite dimensional, depending on the number of basis functions ψn (x). We now list a few properties
of the matrix Anm .
(i)

If A is Hermitian, A† = A, then Anm is a Hermitian matrix, i.e.,
A∗nm = Amn

.

(8.2)

Proof:
A∗nm = (ψn , Aψm )∗ = (Aψm , ψn ) = (ψm , Aψn ) = Amn

.

(ii) If {ψn (x)} is a basis of A, then
Anm = an δnm

(8.3)

holds, where the an are the eigenvalues of A corresponding to ψn (x),
i.e.,
Aψn (x) = an ψn (x)

.

Since {ψn (x)} is a complete, orthonormal system, any arbitrary state ψ(x)
can be represented as

ψ(x) =
cn ψn (x)

system of functions {ψn (x)} according to

3. Position eigenfunctions. In Sect. 2.9, we found the position eigenfunctions

(8.12a)

which satisfy

(8.12b)

The spectrum is once again continuous, and one has

(ψξ , ψξ ) = dx δ(x − ξ)δ(x − ξ  ) = δ(ξ − ξ  ) .
Remark:
As always, the index on the wave functions indicates the eigenvalue as well
as the operator to which it belongs.
We now calculate the matrix representation of a few important operators with respect to the momentum and position eigenfunctions, using the
following notation:
App = (ψp , Aψp )

, Aξξ = (ψξ , Aψξ )

.

Functions of position are diagonal in the coordinate representation, functions of momentum in the momentum representation. Note the similarity
between (8.14a) and (8.14d) as well as between (8.14b) and (8.14c).
To conclude this section, we discuss the expansion of an arbitrary state
ψ(x) in momentum and position eigenfunctions.

the wave function
cξ = (ψξ , ψ) = ψ(ξ)

.

(8.15b)

shows that

cp = (ψp , ψ) = √
2π

.

(8.16b)

Up to the factor (2π)−1/2 , cp is the Fourier transform ϕ(p) of the
wave function. The probability of ﬁnding the value p in a momentum
measurement is given by |cp |2 .
As emphasized in Sect. 2.9, in our axiomatic system we can dispense with
the intermediate hypothesis (which was convenient in the didactic development) that |ψ(x)|2 and |ϕ(p)|2 are respectively the probability density for
position and momentum. This is a consequence of the form of the position
and momentum operators and the general results for the probability densities
of observables in Sect. 2.9.

8.2 State Vectors and Dirac Notation
It is often useful and more transparent to formulate a theory independently
of a particular basis system. This can be illustrated in the case of threedimensional vectors v in the space IR3 (generally IRn ).
One can characterize a vector v ∈ IR3 in some basis {ei } or in another
basis {ei } of the inﬁnitely many bases rotated relative to the ﬁrst one by its
projections onto the respective coordinate axes (Fig. 8.1):

v=
vi ei , vi = ei · v ,
i

v=



vi ei

, vi = ei · v

(8.17)
.

The vector v itself does not change; only its components with respect to the
coordinate axes change under the transformation from the basis {ei } to the
basis {ei } according to the transformation law


vi =
vj ei · ej =
Dij vj .
(8.18)
j

j

The matrix S † of Sect. 8.1 corresponds here to the matrix D. Instead of
characterizing a vector v by its components vi with respect to a particular
coordinate system, it is often more convenient to use the coordinate independent vector notation v.

Fig. 8.1. Coordinate transformation

Analogously, in quantum mechanics one can represent the state ψ(x) in
various basis systems:



cn ψn (x) = dξ cξ ψξ (x) = dp cp ψp (x) = . . . .
(8.19)
ψ(x) =
n

These representations are called the energy, coordinate, and momentum representations (and so on), where the respective basis system is formed by
the energy eigenfunctions ψn , the position eigenfunctions ψξ , the momentum

8.2 State Vectors and Dirac Notation

165

eigenfunctions ψp , etc. The expansion coeﬃcients cn , cξ , cp , etc. characterize
the state ψ equally well. Instead of giving one or another set of inﬁnitely
many components, we introduce a vector notation for the state (Dirac notation) which is independent of the basis:
ψ(x) → |ψ

.

(8.20)

Here, |ψ is a vector in an inﬁnite-dimensional space. For particular states
we will use the abbreviated notation
ψp (x) → |p , ψξ (x) → |ξ ,
ψn (x) → (|ψn ) → |n , ψa → |a

.

(8.21)

For a general (arbitrary) state, we will write for brevity | . The sum of state
vectors and multiplication by complex numbers is deﬁned by
ψc = αψa + βψb → |c = α|a + β|b

.

(8.22)

In particular, from this it follows for multiplication by 1 that
1 ψ = ψ → 1 |ψ = |ψ
and for the addition of the zero element
ψ + 0 = ψ → |ψ + 0 = |ψ

.

Since the wave functions ψ(x) form a linear space, the vectors | also form a
linear space.
Remark: We collect here the mathematical deﬁnitions of a linear space. A linear
space S is deﬁned by the following properties1 :
1a)
b)
c)
d)

If |a, |b ∈ S, then also the sum |a + |b ∈ S.
For |a ∈ S, α ∈ C: α|a ∈ S.
There exists a zero element 0 with |a + 0 = |a.
For each |a ∈ S, the inverse element |a  ∈ S exists, with |a + |a  = 0.

2)

For all |a, |b, |c ∈ S and complex numbers α, β ∈ C, one has the following
properties of addition and multiplication:
a) |a + |b = |b + |a
(Commutativity)
(|a + |b) + |c = |a + (|b + |c)
(Associativity)
b) 1 |a = |a
c) α (β|a) = (α β)|a

(α + β)|a = α|a + β|a

we assign

(8.24b)

The vector ψ| is called “the dual vector to |ψ ”. The space of ψ| is called
the dual space2 . The sum in dual space results from the mapping
ψc∗ = α∗ ψa∗ + β ∗ ψb∗ → c| = α∗ a| + β ∗ b| .

(8.25)

The dual vectors also form a linear space.
We now deﬁne the product of the dual vector a| with the vector |b . We
denote it by ab , usually abbreviated a|b , and deﬁne it by
a|b = (ψa , ψb )

2

To be mathematically precise, one introduces the dual vectors by means of the
linear functionals ψ ∗ → fψ (ϕ) = (ψ, ϕ). These functionals are linear: fψ (αϕa +
βϕb ) = αfψ (ϕa ) + βfψ (ϕb ) and form a linear space: α∗ ψ ∗ + γ ∗ ∗ → fαψ+γ =
α∗ fψ + γ ∗ f . With the notation fψ ≡ ψ| the product fψ (ϕ) ≡ ψ|ϕ results.

Operators
We now need to introduce operators acting on the states of our general state
space. Given an operator A on the space of wave functions (in coordinate
space), let it transform the wave function ψa into ψb , i.e.,
Aψa = ψb

.

(8.30a)

We then write this in basis independent notation as
A|a = |b

.

(8.30b)

The action of the operator A in the vector space is obtained from its action
in the coordinate representation (8.30a) as follows:


|n n|b =
|n (ψn , Aψa ) ,
(8.31)
A|a =
n

n

where |n is an arbitrary basis.
Projection operators
An important class of operators are the projection operators, characterized
by the property
P2 = P

.

(8.32)

The projection operator which projects an arbitrary state |ψ onto the
normalized state |a ( a|a = 1) is denoted Pa :
Pa |ψ = a|ψ |a = |a a|ψ

.

Therefore, we can represent Pa by
Pa = |a a|

.

(8.33)

168

8. Operators, Matrices, State Vectors

Pa is indeed a projection operator, since Pa2 = |a a|a a| = |a a| = Pa . We
call |n a complete, orthonormal set, if the ψn (x) form a complete, orthonormal set. For a complete, orthonormal set, one has
n|m = δnm ,

|n n| = 1l ,

(8.34a)
(8.34b)

n

where 1l is the unit operator. The orthogonality relation follows from the
deﬁnition of the scalar product and the orthogonality of the ψn , while the
completeness relation follows from the possibility of expanding an arbitrary
state |ψ :




|n (ψn , ψ) =
|n n|ψ =
|n n| |ψ .
|ψ =

From the completeness relation (8.34b), one can immediately rederive that




∗

ψn (x)ψn (x ) = x|
|n n| |x = x|x = δ(x − x ) .
n

n

In the continuum case, one has in analogy


dξ | ξ ξ| = 1l ,
dp |p p| = 1l .

(8.35)

Using the completeness relation (8.34b) twice, we can represent an arbitrary
operator A by its matrix elements:



|n n|A|m m| =
n|A|m |n m| =
Anm |n m| .
(8.36)
A=
n,m

n,m

n,m

Up to now, in a matrix element of the type c|A|a , the action of A is
only deﬁned to the right. We deﬁne c|A by

c|A|n n| .
(8.37)
c|A =
n

Thus, the action of an operator to the left derives from its action to the right.
Together with the completeness relation, this implies
( c|A)|a = c|(A|a )

.

(8.38)

Deﬁnition of the adjoint operator
The adjoint operator B † to B is deﬁned by
a|B|b ∗ = b|B † |a

.

It then follows from the equation

Example: For the annihilation and creation operators a and a† of the
harmonic oscillator, one has
√
√
a|n = n |n − 1 and a† |n = n + 1 |n + 1 .
From the preceding relation, it follows that
√
n|a = n + 1 n + 1| ,
i.e., the annihilation operator a acts to the left in the same way as the creation
operator acts to the right.
Deﬁnition. The operator A is called Hermitian if A† = A.

8.3 The Axioms of Quantum Mechanics
The foundations of quantum mechanics may be summarized in the following
axioms:
I. The state of a system is described by the state vector |ψ .
II. The observables are represented by Hermitian operators A, with functions of observables being represented by the corresponding functions of
the operators.
III. The expectation value of the observable A – represented by the operator
A – is given by A = ψ|A|ψ .
IV. The time evolution is determined by the Schrödinger equation3
i

∂
|ψ, t = H|ψ, t
∂t

.

(8.41)

V. If in a measurement of A the value an is found, then the state of the
system changes to the corresponding eigenstate |n .4
From II and III and Sect. 2.9, it follows that if a system is in the state

|ψ =
cn |n with cn = n|ψ ,
n

3

We could also use the ordinary time derivative here, since in the state |ψ, t the
time t is the only independent variable occurring.
4
This is called reduction of the state. See Sect. 20.3, in particular 20.3.4.

170

8. Operators, Matrices, State Vectors

where |n are the eigenstates of A, A|n = an |n , then |cn |2 expresses the
probability that, in a measurement of A, the eigenvalue an will be found.5
This also implies the probability interpretation of the wave function ψ(x).
For stationary states
|ψn , t = e−iEn t/ |ψn

(8.42a)

(8.41) yields the time independent Schrödinger equation for |ψn ,
H|ψn = En |ψn

.

(8.42b)

If at time zero the state is |ψ , then, as in (2.77), the expansion in terms
of stationary states reads

ψn |ψ e−i En t/ |ψn .
(8.43)
|ψ, t =
n

We now derive various representations of the Schrödinger equation from the
basis independent version (8.41).
8.3.1 Coordinate Representation
The spatial wave function is obtained by projection onto |x (8.28) as
x|ψ, t = ψ(x, t)

.

The position eigenvector x| is time independent. We multiply the Schrödinger
equation (8.41) by this on the left,

8.4 Multidimensional Systems
and Many-Particle Systems
Up to now, only one-dimensional systems have been treated in this chapter.
The state space was spanned by the position eigenvectors |ξ , and an arbitrary
state was given by

|ψ = dξ ψ(ξ)|ξ .
In three-dimensional systems, we have for the three Cartesian components
the basis vectors
|ξx

, |ξy

, |ξz

.

(8.48)

A state characterizing a particle located at the position ξ is given by the
direct product of these basis vectors
|ξ = |ξx |ξy |ξz

.

(8.49)

We have
xi |ξ = ξi |ξ

, i = x, y, z

ξ|ξ = δ (3) (ξ − ξ  )

,

.

(8.50)

A general state is given by

|ψ = d3 ξ ψ(ξ)|ξ .

(8.51)

8.5 The Schrödinger, Heisenberg and Interaction Representations

173

If |ξi i = 1, 2, . . . , N are one-particle position eigenstates, one can then
write the N -particle state as
|ξ 1 , ξ 2 , . . . , ξ N = |ξ 1 |ξ 2 . . . |ξ N

.

(8.52)

The corresponding orthonormality relation is
ξ 1 , ξ2 . . . ξN |ξ 1 , ξ 2 . . . ξ N = δ (3) (ξ 1 − ξ 1 ) . . . δ (3) (ξ N − ξ N ) .
Arbitrary states are obtained by superposition of the position eigenstates
(8.52). It is thus clear that the formulae of the previous sections of this
chapter also hold for higher spatial dimensions and many-particle systems,
where ξ, x etc. stand for the whole set of variables.
(1)

Remark: Additional points concerning the direct product: Let vi , i = 1, . . . N1
(2)
be elements of an N1 -dimensional vector space and vj , j = 1, . . . N2 be elements of
(1) (2)

an N2 -dimensional vector space, then their direct product vi vj spans an N1 N2 dimensional space. In the state space 1 of the states |1 let operators A1 act, and in
the state space 2 of the states |2 let operators A2 act. In the direct product space
of the states |1, 2 = |1|2 the operators A1 ⊗ A2 then act, where
1, 2|A1 ⊗ A2 |1 , 2  = 1|A1 |1 2|A2 |2 

.

This corresponds to the deﬁnition of the direct product of matrices. The operator
A1 corresponds to A1 ⊗ I2 in the product space, and the operator A2 corresponds
to I1 ⊗ A2 in the product space, where Ii is the unit operator in the state space i.
One has A1 B1 ⊗ C2 D2 = (A1 ⊗ C2 )(B1 ⊗ D2 ).

8.5 The Schrödinger, Heisenberg
and Interaction Representations
8.5.1 The Schrödinger Representation
We assume that the Hamiltonian H is time independent. The generalization
to a time dependent H will be treated in Chap. 16. The time evolution of
the state vector |ψ, t is then determined by the Schrödinger equation
i

∂
|ψ, t = H|ψ, t
∂t

,

(8.53)

which has the formal solution
|ψ, t = e−iHt/ |ψ, 0

.

(8.54)

This representation of quantum theory, which we have employed up until
now, is called the Schrödinger representation, or Schrödinger picture. The
state vectors depend on time, while the operators corresponding to physical
observables are independent of time, aside from explicit time dependence. In
particular, operators such as x, p, L, etc. are time independent.

174

8. Operators, Matrices, State Vectors

8.5.2 The Heisenberg Representation
In the Heisenberg picture, on the other hand, the operators obey an equation
of motion. Starting with operators A in the Schrödinger picture, one deﬁnes
the Heisenberg operators
AH = eiHt/ A e−iHt/

.

(8.55)

By an elementary calculation, one obtains from this deﬁnition the Heisenberg
equation for the operator AH
d
i
∂
AH = [H, AH ] + AH

.

(8.56)

time, as is the case for example in the presence of an external ﬁeld which is
periodic in time. In the last term,

The Heisenberg state vector is deﬁned by

,

where again exp {−iHt/} exp {iHt/} = 1 has been inserted. The time
dependence of the expectation value comes from the state vector in the
Schrödinger picture and from the operator in the Heisenberg picture.

8.5.3 The Interaction Picture (or Dirac Representation)
For problems whose Hamiltonian

can be separated into a time independent part H0 and a (possibly time dependent) perturbation V (t), the interaction picture is convenient as a point
of departure for time dependent perturbation theory (Sect. 16.3).
The state vectors and the operators in the interaction picture are deﬁned
by

8.6 The Motion of a Free Electron in a Magnetic Field

177

The interaction picture lies in a certain sense between the Schrödinger
and Heisenberg pictures, since both the state vectors and the operators are
time dependent. The state vectors evolve due to the perturbative part of the
Hamiltonian, the operators due to the free part H0 .

8.6 The Motion of a Free Electron in a Magnetic Field
As an example of the use of the Heisenberg representation, and in order to
complete our discussion of free motion in a magnetic ﬁeld, we take up where
we left oﬀ in Sect. 7.7. We omit the index H. The Hamiltonian

(8.72)
[H, mẋ] = ẋ × B .

From (8.71), it is now clear from a quantum theoretical point of view why
we referred to this quantity as the kinetic momentum.
We take B to point in the z-direction, B = (0, 0, B), and consider only
the motion perpendicular to B. Then both equations of motion
mẍ =

mẍ1 =

eB

The ﬁrst integral in (8.73 ) becomes, because of τ 2 = −1l,
ẋ(t) = e−ωc τ t ẋ(0) = (cos ωc t − τ sin ωc t)ẋ(0) ,

(8.75a)

and the solution is then
x(t) = X + ωc−1 τ e−ωc τ t ẋ(0)

.

(8.75b)

From (8.75a) one sees that ẋ(t)2 = ẋ(0)2 , which is a consequence of energy
conservation. The solution is formally identical to the classical one, except

178

9.1 The Experimental Discovery
of the Internal Angular Momentum
9.1.1 The “Normal” Zeeman Eﬀect
In Sect. 7.3, we obtained for electrons in a magnetic ﬁeld B the interaction
term
e
Hint = −
B · L = −μ · B .
(9.1)
2mc
Here, the magnetic moment is
μ=

e
L
2mc

(9.2)

and the quantity e/2mc is known as the gyromagnetic ratio. This contribution
to the Hamiltonian splits the 2l + 1 angular momentum states according to
μB Bml

,

(9.3)

where ml runs over the values −l, . . . , l. Experimentally, however, one ﬁnds
that in atoms with odd atomic number Z, the splitting is as if ml were
half-integer. Moreover, in contrast to (9.3), the magnitude of the splitting is
diﬀerent for diﬀerent levels.
9.1.2 The Stern–Gerlach Experiment
In the Stern–Gerlach experiment, an atomic beam traverses an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 9.1). By (9.1), the force on an atom is
∂Bz
ez
F = ∇(μ · B) ∼
= μz
∂z

.

(9.4)

From the preceding, one would expect a splitting into an odd number of
beams (more precisely, 2l + 1). The experiment was carried out by O. Stern
and W. Gerlach in 1922 with silver atoms. Silver has a spherically symmetric
charge distribution plus one 5s-electron. Thus, the total angular momentum
of silver is zero, i.e., l = 0; no splitting should occur. If the electron from

184

9. Spin

the ﬁfth shell were in a 5p-state, one would then expect a splitting into three
beams. The experiment gives a splitting into two beams. Consequently, the
electron must possess an internal angular momentum (spin) with corresponding gyromagnetic ratio e/mc.

Fig. 9.1. The Stern–Gerlach experiment

A few historical remarks: Pauli: “The doublet structure of the alkali spectra,
as well as the violation of the Larmor theorem, occur due to a peculiar – and not
classically describable – ambiguity of the quantum theoretical properties of the
valence electron.”1
As early as 1921, Compton deduced from the properties of ferromagnetic materials that the electron must possess a magnetic moment.2
Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit: “The electron rotates about its own axis with angular momentum /2. For this value of the angular momentum, there are only two
orientations of the angular momentum vector. The gyromagnetic ratio is twice as
large for the rotation about its own axis as for the orbital motion.”3

One can summarize by saying that the electron possesses an internal angular momentum (called spin) which can assume only the values +/2 and
−/2 in an arbitrarily chosen direction. We will return to the magnetic moment in Sect. 9.5.
The other elementary particles also have spin. Fermions possess halfintegral spin, bosons integral spin (including zero) (see Sect. 13.1.1). In the
following, we will develop the theory for spin-1/2 fermions.

9.2 Mathematical Formulation for Spin-1/2
Let the spin operator be S = (Sx , Sy , Sz ). Now, if e is a unit vector, then
according to Sect. 9.1 S · e has only the two eigenvalues ± /2, i.e.

S · e|e, ± = ± |e, ±

.

(9.5)

Without loss of generality, one can choose e = e3 and introduce the following
notation:

The eigenvalue equation then takes the form

(9.7)

Since the spin is a physical observable, Sz is a Hermitian operator, and the
states |↑ and |↓ belonging to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal, that is,
↑|↓ = 0

.

(9.8a)

We further normalize them to unity:
↑|↑ = ↓|↓ = 1 .

(9.8b)

According to the postulate stated previously, the Si satisfy angular momentum commutation relations
, [Sz , S± ] = ± S±

[Si , Sj ] = iεijk Sk

9.3 Properties of the Pauli Matrices
We collect here the properties of the Pauli spin matrices:
σx2 = σy2 = σz2 = 1l (1l = unit matrix)

(9.17a)

[σx , σy ] = 2iσz and cyclical permutations ,

(9.17b)

{σx , σy } = 0 and cyclical permutations ,

(9.17c)

σx σy = −σy σx = iσz and cyclical permutations ,

(9.17d)

σx σy σz = i · 1l ,

(9.17e)

tr σx = tr σy = tr σz = 0

,

det σx = det σy = det σz = −1 .

(9.17f)
(9.17g)

These relations can be proven without explicit use of the representation (9.16).
It follows from (9.7) that Sz2 |↑ = (/2)2 |↑ and likewise for |↓ . Thus,
2
σz = 1l. Since the unit matrix remains invariant under transformation to
another basis, and the z-direction is not preferred, the remaining identities

9.4 States, Spinors

187

in (9.17a) follow. Equation (9.17b) follows from the spin commutation relations, and (9.17c) can be seen from
2
= (Sx + iSy )2 = Sx2 − Sy2 + i{Sx , Sy } = i{Sx , Sy } .
0 = S+

Adding (9.17b) and (9.17c), one gets (9.17d). From (9.17d) and (9.17a) follows (9.17e). Since σz has vanishing trace and determinant −1, due to its
equal (in magnitude) and opposite eigenvalues, (9.17f) and (9.17g) follow.
The relations (9.17a,b,c) can be summarized compactly in the identity
σi σj = δij + iεijk σk

,

(9.18a)

from which
(σ · a)(σ · b) = 1l a · b + iσ · (a × b)

(9.18b)

immediately follows for arbitrary vectors a and b which commute with σ.

9.4 States, Spinors
In the basis {|↑ , |↓ } used up to now, a general spin state can be written as
| = α+ |↑ + α− |↓

(9.19)

with complex coeﬃcients α± . Normalization requires
|α+ |2 + |α− |2 = 1 .

(9.20)

μorbit =

is associated with the orbital angular momentum L of an electron. Now, there
is no reason to suppose that the magnetic moment due to spin μspin should

μspin = g

(9.25)

where g is the Landé factor or gyromagnetic factor. The analysis of the Zeeman eﬀect given in Sect. 9.1.1, which will be discussed in detail in Chap. 14,
implies for electrons
g ≈ 2 .

where mp = 1.6726 × 10−24 g is the mass of the proton. Due to the
larger mass of the proton, μN = 0.505 × 10−23 erg/G ≈ 10−3 μB is
about one-thousandth of the Bohr magneton. The quantity μN is the
characteristic quantity for nuclear magnetism and for the magnetic moments of nucleons. The gyromagnetic ratio of the strongly interacting
proton is gproton = 5.59. Neutral particles such as n, Λ, Σ 0 also possess a
magnetic moment. It arises from the internal charge distribution, which
can be understood in light of the fact that the fundamental constituents
of hadrons are quarks. For the neutron,

(9.31)

For the deuteron, the nucleus of deuterium , μdeut = 0.86μN , i.e.,
μdeut ≈ μprot + μneut . The spins of the proton and the neutron are
parallel in the deuteron, i.e. the spin of the deuteron is 1; the antiparallel state does not give rise to binding.

9.6 Spatial Degrees of Freedom and Spin
Spin is an additional degree of freedom independent of the spatial degrees of
freedom. Spin and position (or momentum) can assume precise values simultaneously and independently of one another, i.e., the corresponding operators
commute:
[S, x] = 0 , [S, p] = 0 , [S, L] = 0 .

(9.32)

The total state is constructed from the direct product of position and spin
eigenstates. The states |x |↑ and |x |↓ can be chosen as a basis. In this
basis, a general state |Ψ is given by

(9.33)
|Ψ = d3 x (ψ+ (x)|x |↑ + ψ− (x)|x |↓ ) .
The projections onto position and spin eigenstates are
x|Ψ = ψ+ (x) |↑ + ψ− (x) |↓
↑| x|Ψ = ψ+ (x)

↓| x|Ψ = ψ− (x)

The quantities |ψ+(−) (x)| express the probability of ﬁnding the particle at
the position x with spin in the positive (negative) z-direction. The normalization condition is

10. Addition of Angular Momenta

10.1 Posing the Problem
In later sections it will be necessary to introduce the total angular momentum
J = L + S and, in the case of two electrons with their respective spins, S 1
and S 2 , to consider the total spin S = S 1 + S 2 . Generally, supposing that
we have two angular momentum operators, J 1 and J 2 , the problem consists
in investigating the total angular momentum
J = J1 + J2

.

(10.1)

Assuming that J 1 and J 2 correspond to distinct degrees of freedom, they
commute with each other:
[J 1 , J 2 ] = 0

.

(10.2)

Together with the angular momentum commutation relations of J 1,2 , this
gives for the components of J
[Ji , Jj ] = iεijk Jk

.

(10.3)

Thus, all the properties of angular momenta and their eigenstates hold for
the total angular momentum J .
We begin with the states |j1 , m1 and |j2 , m2 , where the two quantum
numbers j1 and j2 are ﬁxed, and the mi take the values −ji , . . . , ji . From
these states, we can construct the product states
|j1 m1 j2 m2 = |j1 m1 |j2 m2

,

(10.4)

which are eigenstates of the operators
J 21 , J1z , J 22 , J2z

(10.5a)

with eigenvalues
2 j1 (j1 + 1) , m1 , 2 j2 (j2 + 1) , m2

.

(10.5b)

The product states (10.4) are of course also eigenfunctions of Jz with eigenvalue (m1 + m2 ), but not eigenfunctions of J 2 , since

194

10. Addition of Angular Momenta

[J 2 , Jiz ] = 0 ,

i = 1, 2 .

(10.6)

One sees this either by explicit calculation of the commutators or by realizing
that Jiz generates a rotation in the subspace i, and that J 2 is only a scalar
for the total rotation generated by Jz = J1z + J2z . However, for the problems
mentioned above, we search for states in which J 2 is also diagonal; more
precisely, we seek eigenfunctions
|jmj j1 j2

(10.7)

of the four mutually commuting operators
J 2 , Jz , J 21 , J 22

(10.8)

with eigenvalues 2 j(j + 1), mj , 2 j1 (j1 + 1), 2 j2 (j2 + 1).
At the same time, we have to ﬁnd the values taken by j (the corresponding mj are then −j, . . . , j), and we have to represent |jmj j1 j2 as a linear
combination of the product states (10.4). We postpone the general problem
until Sect. 10.4 and treat for the moment the addition of two spins followed
by the addition of an orbital angular momentum to a spin.

10.2 Addition of Spin-1/2 Operators
This is the simplest case, which among other things will be required for the
treatment of the helium atom. Let S 1 and S 2 be the two spin-1/2 operators
and
S = S1 + S2

(10.9)

the total spin. The four states
|↑↑ = |↑ |↑

, |↓↓ = |↓ |↓

,

|↑↓ = |↑ |↓

, |↓↑ = |↓ |↑

,

(10.10)

in which the ﬁrst (second) symbol refers to the ﬁrst (second) spin, are eigenstates of S 21 , S 22 , S1z , S2z . It is reasonable to suppose that the total spin S
assumes the values 1 and 0. To show this, we compute
Sz |↑↑ =  |↑↑
Sz |↓↓ = − |↓↓

,
,

Sz |↑↓ = 0

,

Sz |↓↑ = 0

.

(10.11)

Furthermore,
S 2 = S 21 + S 22 + 2S 1 · S 2
= 32 2 + 2S1z S2z + S1+ S2− + S1− S2+

.

(10.12)

Let us ﬁrst consider the two maximally aligned states |↑↑ and |↓↓ . For these,
we ﬁnd from (10.12)

(10.13a)

and
S 2 |↓↓ = 22 |↓↓

.

(10.13b)

The states |↑↑ and |↓↓ therefore have total spin S = 1 and Sz = ± . The
as yet missing spin-1 state with Sz = 0 is obtained by application of S− to
|↑↑ :

(10.14)

The√resulting state has been normalized to unity by inserting the factor
1/ 2. By (10.11), it has Sz = 0. Thus, we have found all three S = 1 states.
Using the notation |S, m , in which S designates the total spin and m its
z-component, we have
|1, 1 = |↑↑

1
, |1, 0 = √ (|↑↓ + |↓↑ ) , |1, −1 = |↓↓

(10.15)

There is an additional state, which is orthogonal to those given above:
1
|0, 0 = √ (|↑↓ − |↓↑ )
2

.

(10.16)

For this state, evidently
Sz |0, 0 = 0

(10.17b)

As implied already in (10.16), this state has spin 0. Thus, we have found all
four eigenstates of S 2 and Sz . The states (10.15) are also referred to as triplet
states and (10.16) as a singlet state. Occasionally it turns out to be useful to
introduce the projection operators

10.3 Orbital Angular Momentum and Spin 1/2
Beginning with orbital angular momentum L and spin S, we deﬁne the total
angular momentum
J =L+S

.

(10.19)

The 2(2l + 1) product states
|l, ml |↑

and |l, ml |↓

(10.20)

with ml = −l, . . . , l are eigenstates of L2 , S 2 , Lz , Sz , but not of J 2 . We seek
eigenstates of J 2 , L2 , S 2 , Jz . Presumably j, the quantum number to J 2 , has
the values
j = l + 12 , l − 12

;

this would also give the right number of states:
2(l + 12 ) + 1 + 2(l − 12 ) + 1 = 2(2l + 1) .
For the following, recall (5.15)
L± |l, ml = ((l ± ml + 1)(l ∓ ml ))1/2 |l, ml ± 1
and the identity
J 2 = L2 + S 2 + 2Lz Sz + L+ S− + L− S+

.

(10.21)

For the eigenstates of J 2 , Jz , L2 , and S 2 we use the notation |j, mj , l ,
without indicating S = 1/2, and claim as a point of departure that
|l + 12 , l + 12 , l = |l, l |↑

.

(10.22)

We prove this by means of
Jz |l, l |↑ = (Lz + Sz )|l, l |↑ = (l + 12 )|l, l |↑

(10.23a)

and, using (10.21),
J 2 |l, l |↑ = 2 (l(l + 1) + 34 + 2l 21 )|l, l |↑
= 2 (l + 12 )(l + 32 )|l, l |↑

.

(10.23b)

10.3 Orbital Angular Momentum and Spin 1/2

197

In order to obtain all the states |l + 1/2, ml+1/2 , l , one need only apply
J− = L− + S− repeatedly to (10.22). We ﬁrst ﬁnd
J− |l, l |↑ = (2l)1/2 |l, l − 1 |↑ + |l, l |↓

Repeated application of J− leads to the following general result, which can
be easily veriﬁed by mathematical induction with respect to mj :

(10.25)

where mj takes the half-integer values l + 1/2, . . . , −(l + 1/2). With (10.25),
the states belonging to j = l + 1/2 have been found. In order to determine
the remaining states, we remark that, beginning with (10.25) with mj =
l − 1/2, . . . , −(l − 1/2), one can immediately construct states which are
orthogonal to all the states of (10.25), that is,

l − mj + 1/2

(10.26)

with mj = l − 1/2, . . . , −(l − 1/2).
Since
Jz |l − 12 , mj , l = mj |l − 12 , mj , l

(10.27a)

and
J 2 |l − 12 , mj , l = 2 (l − 12 )(l + 12 )|l − 12 , mj , l

,

(10.27b)

these are the eigenstates of J 2 and Jz with j = l − 12 and mj . And of course
the states (10.25) and (10.26) are eigenstates of L2 and S 2 . Equation (10.27a)
follows without calculation, and (10.27b) is left to the reader as an exercise.
For l = 0, there is only the state | 12 , ± 12 , 0 . States |0− 21 , mj , 0 of negative
j do not exist.
For later use, we write the total angular momentum states as follows:
|l ± 12 , mj , l = α± |l, mj − 12 |↑ + β± |l, mj + 12 |↓

10. Addition of Angular Momenta

10.4 The General Case
After these introductory special cases, we now treat the general case of the
addition of two arbitrary angular momenta J 1 and J 2 to form a total angular
momentum J = J 1 + J 2 . In Sect. 10.1, we introduced the two complete sets
of commuting angular momentum operators
J 21 , J1z , J 22 , J2z
J 2 , Jz , J 21 , J 22

,

(10.5a)

.

(10.8)

The corresponding systems of eigenfunctions
|j1 m1 |j2 m2 = |j1 m1 j2 m2

,

(10.4)

|jmj1 j2

(10.7)

form complete orthonormal systems. Consequently, the states (10.7) can be
expanded in terms of (10.4). Here, the scalar products
j1 m1 j2 m2 |jmj1 j2 ≡ j1 m1 | j2 m2 |jmj1 j2

(10.29)

enter as expansion coeﬃcients. It is immediately clear that, because of
j1 m1 j2 m2 |(J 2i |jmj1 j2 ) = ( j1 m1 j2 m2 |J 2i )|jmj1 j2

,

one has
ji (ji + 1) j1 m1 j2 m2 |jmj1 j2 = ji (ji + 1) j1 m1 j2 m2 |jmj1 j2

.

Therefore, only the coeﬃcients with j1 = j1 and j2 = j2 are nonvanishing. If
one further considers the matrix element of Jz = J1z + J2z ,
j1 m1 j2 m2 |Jz |jmj1 j2 = (m1 + m2 ) j1 m1 j2 m2 |jmj1 j2
= m j1 m1 j2 m2 |jmj1 j2 ,
one ﬁnds that the coeﬃcients (10.29) are nonvanishing only for m = m1 +m2 .
Thus, the expansion of |jmj1 j2 in the basis |j1 m1 j2 m2 can be reduced to

|j1 m1 j2 m2 j1 m1 j2 m2 |jmj1 j2 .
(10.30)
|jmj1 j2 =
m1
m2 =m−m1

The j1 m1 j2 m2 |jmj1 j2 are called Clebsch–Gordan coeﬃcients. We now wish
to determine the values of j for given j1 and j2 . The values of m1 and m2
corresponding to j1 and j2 are
m1 = j1 , j1 − 1, . . . , −j1 and m2 = j2 , j2 − 1, . . . , −j2

.

Since m = m1 + m2 , the values of m and all the corresponding m1 and m2
can immediately be given. This is presented in Table 10.1, where we assume
without loss of generality j1 ≥ j2 .

−|j1 − j2 | < m < |j1 − j2 |

j1 + j2 − |j1 − j2 | + 1

m ≤ −|j1 − j2 |

j1 + j2 − |m| + 1

The possible j-values can now be determined by beginning with the maximally aligned states. Since j1 + j2 is the maximal m-value, j1 + j2 must also
be the largest value of the total angular momentum j. By the general properties of angular momentum operators, the corresponding m-values are then
j1 + j2 , j1 + j2 − 1, . . . , −j1 − j2 . These values of m are thus already used up.
Since the value m = j1 + j2 − 1 is doubly degenerate, it now is the highest
value of m, so that the next highest value of the total angular momentum is
j = j1 + j2 − 1. The corresponding m-values are j1 + j2 − 1, . . . , −j1 − j2 + 1.
Since the value m = j1 + j2 − 2 has three-fold degeneracy, this m-value is now
the highest, so that one can take the next multiplet to be j = j1 + j2 − 2.
The argument can be continued in this manner, until one ﬁnally obtains the
multiplet structure shown in Table 10.3.

10. Addition of Angular Momenta

The possible values of j are thus given by the triangular relation
|j1 − j2 | ≤ j ≤ j1 + j2

,

(10.31)

where the values of j proceed in integer steps. Evidently, one obtains a halfintegral angular momentum upon adding an integral and a half-integral angular momentum. The two limiting values in (10.31) correspond to angular
momenta aligned parallel and antiparallel.

11. Approximation Methods
for Stationary States

Although we have succeeded in solving some important and interesting quantum mechanical problems, an exact solution is not possible in complicated
situations, and we must then resort to approximation methods. For the calculation of stationary states and energy eigenvalues, these include perturbation
theory, the variational method , and the WKB approximation. Perturbation
theory is applicable if the problem diﬀers from an exactly solvable problem
by a small amount. The variational method is appropriate for the calculation
of the ground state energy if one has a qualitative idea of the form of the wave
function, and ﬁnally the WKB method is applicable in the nearly classical
limit.

11.1 Time Independent Perturbation Theory
(Rayleigh–Schrödinger)
Let the Hamiltonian H consist of two parts,
H = H0 + λH1

.

(11.1)

Let the eigenvalues En0 and eigenfunctions |n0 of the operator H0 be known
exactly,
H0 |n0 = En0 |n0

,

(11.2)

and the “perturbation” λH1 be, in comparison to H0 , a small additional
term. One seeks the discrete stationary states |n and eigenvalues En of H,
H|n = En |n

.

(11.3)

We now assume that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be expanded in
a power series in the parameter λ
En = En0 + λEn1 + λ2 En2 + . . .

,

|n = |n0 + λ|n1 + λ2 |n2 + . . .

,

where in both expansions the ﬁrst term is the “unperturbed” one.

11. Approximation Methods for Stationary States

Remarks:
(i)

This series is frequently not convergent. However, in many cases it is an
asymptotic expansion1 , i.e., the ﬁrst few terms nevertheless give reliable
results. The crucial point is whether in the limit λ → 0, En → En0 and
|n → |n0 are valid. Perturbation theory works whenever the state with
ﬁnite λ does not diﬀer qualitatively from the state with λ = 0.
(ii) In some cases, En and |n are not expandable in λ. For example, the
binding energy of Cooper pairs is Δ ≈ ωD exp {−1/V N (0)}. The bound
states of a potential cannot be obtained from the continuum states by
means of perturbation theory.
(iii) The smallness of the perturbation is by no means always evident from
a small coupling parameter λ, but can be hidden in the structure of H1 .
11.1.1 Nondegenerate Perturbation Theory

We ﬁrst develop perturbation theory for nondegenerate unperturbed states
|n0 of the discrete part of the spectrum. From the time independent
Schrödinger equation (11.3) and from (11.4)
(H0 + λH1 )(|n0 + λ|n1 + λ2 |n2 + . . . )
= (En0 + λEn1 + λ2 En2 + . . . )(|n0 + λ|n1 + λ2 |n2 + . . . )

,

one obtains for λ by comparison of the coeﬃcients of λ0 , λ1 , λ2 . . .

11.1 Time Independent Perturbation Theory (Rayleigh–Schrödinger)

We would now like to determine the expansion coeﬃcients. To this end, we
multiply (11.5b) by n0 | and use (11.5a), with the result
En1 = n0 |H1 |n0

.

(11.7a)

Since the unperturbed states |m0 form a complete orthonormal set, by
(11.6b) we have the expansion

cm |m0
(11.8a)
|n1 =

with

(iii) If an important (large matrix element, small distance) level Em

11.1.2 Perturbation Theory for Degenerate States
Let |n0a , |n0b , . . . , |n0k be degenerate, i.e.,
H0 |n0i = ε|n0i

.

(11.9)

0
Since perturbation theory is an expansion in λ m0 |H1 |n0 /(En0 − Em
), in
place of this basis a basis |n0α must be used in which
(α)

n0α |H1 |n0β = H1 δαβ

,

(11.10)

thus vanishing for α = β, in order that no zero energy denominators (which
would lead to divergences) occur.
The matrix elements
H1ij = n0i |H1 |n0j

(11.11)

form a Hermitian matrix. The new states

|n0α =
ciα |n0i

(11.12)

i

appropriate for perturbation theory give matrix elements

H1αβ = n0α |H1 |n0β =
c∗iα H1ij cjβ .

(11.13)

i,j

Since any Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation,
it is always possible to choose the ciα in such a way that (11.10) is satisﬁed.
In general, one must solve an eigenvalue problem, but often the correct states
can be guessed. From (11.10) and (11.13), one obtains

(α)
c∗iα H1ij cjβ = H1 δαβ ,
(11.14a)
i,j



and, multiplying by ciα and using unitarity ( i c∗iα ciβ = δαβ , α ciα c∗jα
= δij ), one obtains the eigenvalue equation

(β)
H1ij cjβ = H1 ciβ .
(11.14b)
j

The solvability condition implies the vanishing of the secular determinant
(β)

det (H1ij − H1 δij ) = 0 .

(11.14c)
(β)

From (11.14c) and (11.14b), one obtains the H1 and ciβ in the usual way
and thus the appropriate unperturbed states (11.12) for the application of
the perturbation theory developed in Sect. 11.1.1.
Here, an additional remark may be of use. In any nontrivial problem, H0
and H1 do not commute. These two operators cannot therefore be diagonalized simultaneously. However, in the subspace of a group of degenerate

11.2 The Variational Principle

207

states, the reduced matrix corresponding to H0 is a unit matrix, and hence
it is possible to ﬁnd a new basis in this subspace in which H0 and H1 are
both diagonal. Of course, even after this transformation has been carried out,
there are still nonvanishing nondiagonal matrix elements of H1 for states of
diﬀering En0 .

11.2 The Variational Principle
For a Hamiltonian H with basis |n , one has for arbitrary |ψ


ψ|H|ψ =
ψ|n n|H|ψ =
En ψ|n n|ψ
n

≥ E0



n

| ψ|n | = E0 ψ|ψ

n

and thus
E0 ≤

ψ|H|ψ
ψ|ψ

.

(11.15)

The Ritz variational principle consists in specifying |ψ(μ) to be a function
of one or more parameters μ and seeking the minimum of the expression
E(μ) =

ψ(μ)|H|ψ(μ)
ψ(μ)|ψ(μ)

.

(11.16)

The minimum of E(μ) is then an upper bound for the ground state energy.
In this procedure, an error in the wave function manifests itself at
quadratic order in the energy; i.e., let
|ψ = |n + |ε

(11.17)

with n|ε = 0; then
ψ|H|ψ
En + ε|H|ε
=
= En + O(ε2 ) .
ψ|ψ
n|n + ε|ε

(11.18)

The energy is thus determined more accurately than the wave function under
application of a variational principle.
Aside from its function as an approximation method, the variational principle is also an important tool in mathematical physics in the proof of exact
inequalities.

11.3 The WKB (Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin) Method
We now wish to consider the stationary states of a potential for energies sufﬁciently high such that the typical wavelength of the state is small compared
to the characteristic distance over which the potential varies signiﬁcantly. In
this “quasi-classical” limit, we expect that the wave function can be characterized by a position dependent wave number.
To analyze this behavior systematically, we represent the wave function
by an amplitude A and a phase S,
ψ(x) = A(x)eiS(x)/

.

(11.19)

Substituting this into the time independent Schrödinger equation

one ﬁnds
A(∇S)2 − iA∇2 S − 2i(∇A)(∇S) − 2 ∇2 A = 2m(E − V )A

. (11.20)

Comparing the ﬁrst two terms, we expect that the quasi-classical region is
given by
(∇S)2  ∇2 S

.

(11.21)

We take the real and imaginary parts of (11.20):
(∇S)2 = 2m(E − V ) + 2 (∇2 A)/A
−∇2 S = 2∇S · ∇ log A

.

(11.40)

with λ = 2π/p. Using (11.23), one easily sees that (11.40) also implies the

Remark: Using (11.27), one can also write the condition (11.40)pin the form
m|V  |/p3  1. To the right of the turning point b, one has p = 2m|V  |x1/2

This is identical to the domain of validity x

V  x  |V  | and in particular V  l0  |V  | must also hold. For atoms, V = Ze2 /r,
V  ≈ −Ze2 /a2 , V  ≈ Ze2 /a3 and one obtains l0  a. Since l0 ∝ Z −1/3 , the
quasiclassical approximation is reliable for large Z.

11.4 Brillouin–Wigner Perturbation Theory
We now discuss the Brillouin–Wigner perturbation theory, in which the perturbation series for the stationary states contains the exact energy eigenvalues. We begin with the time independent Schrödinger equation
(En − H0 ) |n = λH1 |n

,

(11.41a)

where we again ﬁx the normalization of |n by
n0 |n = 1

(11.41b)

and multiply (11.41a) by n0 |. This yields the following relation for the energy
eigenvalue En :
En = En0 + λ n0 |H1 |n

.

The prime indicates that in the sum over m the term m = n is excluded. We

side by the entire right side):

(11.45)

Here, the exact energy En arises. If En is known – e.g., from a variational
calculation – the Brillouin–Wigner series for |n provides a more rapidly converging series than the Rayleigh–Schrödinger series for |n . If one substitutes
for En the Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation series, (11.45) again yields the
Rayleigh–Schrödinger series for |n .

The relativistic corrections – also known as ﬁne-structure corrections – consist
of the following contributions:
(i) relativistic kinetic energy
(ii) spin–orbit coupling
(iii) the Darwin term
These follow from the Dirac equation in an expansion in (v/c)2 . According
to our estimate in Sect. 6.3, v/c ≈ Zα, these corrections are smaller than the
Coulomb energy by a factor of (Zα)2 . We will discuss each of the terms

From the relativistic Dirac equation, the spin–orbit coupling
H2 =

V (r)
S·L
2m2 c2
r dr

(12.8)

follows, where V (r) = eΦ(r) is the potential energy in the electrostatic potential Φ(r) of the nucleus. In order to understand (12.8) heuristically, we
note that the electric ﬁeld of the nucleus is E = −∇Φ = −(x/r)dΦ/dr. In
the rest frame of the electron, the nucleus orbits about the electron, which
feels a magnetic ﬁeld B = −v × E/c .
The energy of the magnetic moment of the electron is then

However, this result is too large by a factor of 2 compared to (12.8). The
discrepancy occurs because the rest frame of the electron is not an inertial
frame. If one takes into account the eﬀect of the Thomas precession2 , an
additional kinematic term arises which together with (12.9) gives the correct
result (12.8).

12. Relativistic Corrections

Because of the spin–orbit term H2 in the total Hamiltonian
H = H0 + H 1 + H 2 + H 3

,

Lz does not commute with H. Thus H, L2 , Lz , S 2 , Sz do not form a complete
set of operators. Instead, the operators H, J 2 , Jz , L2 , S 2 now form a complete
set, and the eigenfunctions can be characterized by their eigenvalues. H3 is
deﬁned in (12.20).
The correct unperturbed states for perturbation theory are therefore

The coeﬃcients α± and β± are deﬁned in (10.28). The states (12.14) are
eigenstates of H0 with energy eigenvalues En , which are 2n2 -fold degenerate;
however, all the oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements of the perturbed part of the
Hamiltonian H1 + H2 + H3 vanish.

Remark:
The states with l = 0 require further discussion; 1/r3 ∼ 1/l diverges for
l = 0. Because of the factor l in the matrix element of S·L, this divergence was
not manifest. If one assumes in place of the Coulomb potential an extended
nucleus, then (1/r)dV /dr is no longer singular for l = 0, i.e.,
H2 n,j=1/2,l=0 = 0

.

Therefore, (12.18) only holds for l ≥ 1.

the “Zitterbewegung” of the electron. According to the relativistic theory,
the position of a localized electron ﬂuctuates with
δr =

.

The electron therefore feels on the average a potential
V (x + δx) = V (x) + δx∇V + 12 (δx∇)(δx∇)V (x)
= V (x) + 16 (δr)2 ∇2 V (x) .

(12.21)

The correction thus calculated is in qualitative agreement in form, sign, and
magnitude with the Darwin term (12.20).

Sommerfeld on the basis of the old quantum theory with only the p4 -term.
However, in fact the correction is due to three eﬀects.
Below, for a level with spin s, orbital angular momentum L, and total
angular momentum j, we use spectroscopic notation 2s+1 Lj . In the hydrogen
atom, 2s + 1 = 2. Figure 12.1 shows the shift (kinetic relativistic energy less
than zero) and splitting of the levels with l ≥ 1 in j = l ± 1/2 (spin–orbit
coupling greater than zero for j = l + 1/2, less than zero for j = l − 1/2).
The levels 2 S1/2 and 2 P1/2 are still degenerate. This remains valid in
Dirac theory to all orders in α. The ﬁne-structure splitting between 22 P1/2
and 22 S1/2 on the one hand and 22 P3/2 on the other is 0.45 × 10−4 eV or
equivalently 1.09 × 104 MHz.

We now give the computation of the expectation values (12.4a,b) and

but the calculation is tedious. Here, we instead make use of algebraic methods3 .

include α(Zα)4 -terms, which are numerically somewhat smaller, and shifts

to the so called Fermi-contact interaction in (12.42). The latter is represented by
the last two terms of Eq. (12.42), and enters in all matrix elements with a factor
Θ(|x| − ) excluding the inﬁnitesimal sphere. The Hamiltonian (12.42) is the basis

13.1 Identical Particles
13.1.1 Bosons and Fermions
We consider N identical particles (e.g., electrons, π-mesons). The Hamiltonian
H = H(1, 2, . . . , N )

(13.1)

is symmetric in the variables 1, 2, . . . . Here, 1 ≡ x1 , χ1 includes position and
spin degrees of freedom. Likewise, we write a wave function in the form
ψ = ψ(1, 2, . . . , N ) .
The permutation operator Pij interchanges i ↔ j; its action on an arbitrary
N -particle wave function is
Pij ψ( . . . i, . . . , j . . . ) = ψ( . . . j, . . . , i . . . ) .

(13.2)

Since Pij2 = 1, Pij has the eigenvalues ± 1. By the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, for every element P of the permutation group, the relation
P H = HP

(13.3)

holds.
Remark: Every element P can be represented as the product of transpositions Pij .
An element P is called even (odd) if there are an even (odd) number of the Pij .

Let ψ(1, . . . , N ) be an eigenfunction of H with eigenvalue E; this then
holds for P ψ(1, . . . , N ) as well.
Proof:

Hψ = Eψ → HP ψ = P Hψ = EP ψ.

For any symmetrical operator S(1, . . . , N ), one has by (13.3)
[P, S] = 0

P ψ|S|P ψ = ψ|P † SP |ψ = ψ|P † P S|ψ = ψ|S|ψ

.

The expectation value and, more generally, the matrix elements in the states
ψ and P ψ of a symmetrical operator S are equal.2 Since identical particles
are inﬂuenced equivalently by any physical process, all physical operators are
symmetric and thus the states
ψ(1, . . . , N ) and P ψ(1, . . . , N )
cannot be distinguished from one another. The question then arises whether
all these states are realized in nature. On aesthetic grounds, one might suspect
that the completely symmetric states and the completely antisymmetric states
occupy a privileged position. They are deﬁned by
Pij ψ( . . . i, . . . , j . . . ) = ± ψ( . . . i, . . . , j . . . )

(13.4)

for all Pij , e.g., for two particles,
ψs (1, 2) = ψ(1, 2) + ψ(2, 1) , ψa (1, 2) = ψ(1, 2) − ψ(2, 1) .

(13.5)

A completely (anti)symmetric state remains so for all time. (Perturbation V :
ψ → ψ+V ψ+. . . , P V ψ = V P ψ = ± V ψ. Quite generally Eq. (16.9 ) ψ(t) =

T exp{i 0 dt H(t )/}ψ(0) implies P ψ(t) = T exp{i 0 dt H(t )/}P ψ(0).)
Experimental ﬁndings imply that there exist two types of particles, bosons
and fermions, whose states are completely symmetric and completely antisymmetric, respectively. Fermions have half-integral spin, whereas bosons
have integral spin. This connection between spin and symmetry follows from
the spin-statistics theorem of quantum ﬁeld theory. Signiﬁcant consequences
of these two symmetries of many-particle physics are Fermi–Dirac statistics
and Bose–Einstein statistics.

ψ|ϕ = ψ|P † P ϕ and the unitarity P † = P −1 .
2
The opposite is also true. The requirement that a permutation of identical
particles must not have any observable consequences implies that observables
O are symmetric (permutation invariant). Proof: ψ|O|ψ = P ψ|O|P ψ =
ψ|P † O|P ψ holds for arbitrary ψ and thus P † OP = O. Consequently P O =

From Pij ψ( . . . i, . . . , j . . . ) = ψ( . . . j, . . . , i . . . ) = −ψ( . . . i, . . . , j . . . ), it
follows for fermions that
ψ( . . . , xσ, . . . , xσ, . . . ) = 0 .

(13.6)

Thus, two fermions in the same spin state cannot occupy the same position.
This is the Pauli exclusion principle 4 .
Remark: The completely symmetric and the completely antisymmetric N -particle
states form the basis of two one-dimensional representations of the permutation
group SN . This is seen from (13.4) and from the fact that every permutation can
be represented by products of transpositions. Since the Pij do not all commute
with each other for more than two particles, there are also wave functions for
which not all the Pij are diagonal. These are basis functions of higher-dimensional
representations of the permutation group. These states do not occur in nature.5

The Yang-Mills gauge bosons of the electroweak interaction are W+ , W− , Z0
and the photon γ, and those of the strong interaction are the gluons.

For N identical, noninteracting particles, the Hamiltonian

is the sum of N identical one-particle Hamiltonians H(i). From the solutions
of the one-particle Schrödinger equation

(13.8)

where αi numbers the one-particle states, we ﬁrst form the product states

now construct states of these two types.

These determinants of one-particle states are called Slater determinants. The
antisymmetry of (13.12) is immediately apparent, since interchange of√any
two columns introduces a factor of –1. The normalization factor is 1/ N !,
because (13.12) consists of N ! mutually orthogonal terms. For even (odd)
permutations, (−1)P = ± 1. One has ψa (1, . . . N ) = 0 for ϕαi = ϕαj . No

The ground state of N bosons is given by

Fermions are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, according to which
each momentum state can only be doubly occupied (sz = ± /2). The ground
state is obtained by putting the N fermions one after another into the lowest available states. By (13.14), the occupied states lie within a sphere in
momentum space inside of

The crucial diﬀerence between bosons and fermions, which for free (= noninteracting) particles is manifest in (13.15) and (13.16), leads to characteristic
diﬀerences in the low-temperature behavior of such particles (Bose–Einstein
condensation, linear speciﬁc heat, etc.)
Remarks: (i) First of all, concerning the boundary conditions: While counting
states, we used periodic boundary conditions ψp (x + L) = ψp (x). If instead we
assume inﬁnitely high barriers, the wave functions are

(ii) We now consider one-dimensional
bosons in a ring of circumference L, so
√
that 0 ≤ ϕ < L. Is the state ψ = 1/ L compatible with the uncertainty relation
at all?
For this state
ψp = sin

ψ|pϕ |ψ = ψ|p2ϕ |ψ = 0

,

where pϕ = (/i)∂/∂ϕ, or Δpϕ = 0, while ϕ = L/2, ϕ2  = L2 /3 and thus
ΔϕΔpϕ = 0

.

The apparent contradiction to the uncertainty relation can be explained as follows:
(/i) ∂/∂ϕ is a Hermitian operator in the space of the periodic functions eiϕk ,
k = 2π/L. However, the operator ϕ takes us out of the space of these functions,
ϕeiϕk |0 = ϕeiϕk |L

,

and for such functions (/i) ∂/∂ϕ is not Hermitian. Therefore, the proof of the
uncertainty relation does not hold for ϕ and (/i) ∂/∂ϕ.

Composite particles
Example – the H-atom: An H-atom consists of two fermions: a proton p and
an electron e. In order to see whether the H-atom is a fermion or a boson,
we investigate what happens to the wave function ψ(p1 , e1 ; p2 , e2 ) when two
H-atoms are interchanged. Since p and e are fermions,

13.2 Helium

233

ψ(p1 , e1 ; p2 , e2 ) = −ψ(p2 , e1 ; p1 , e2 ) = ψ(p2 , e2 ; p1 , e1 ) .
Hence, the H-atom is a boson.
In general, if the number of fermions in a composite particle is odd, then it
is a fermion, otherwise a boson; e.g., baryons consist of three quarks and are
thus fermions, while mesons consist of two quarks and are therefore bosons.
3
He is a fermion, 4 He a boson.

13.2 Helium
In this section, the simplest multielectron atom is treated, consisting of two
electrons in the ﬁeld of a nucleus with nuclear charge Z. For helium, Z = 2,
and for H− , Z = 1. Neglecting for the moment the spin–orbit interaction and
the motion of the nucleus (mn  me ), one can write the Hamiltonian in the

Here, H(i) is the hydrogenic Hamiltonian, i.e., that of a nucleus with nuclear
charge Z and only one electron, while V gives the electrostatic repulsion of
the two electrons.
13.2.1 Without the Electron–Electron Interaction
Neglecting for now the mutual electrostatic repulsion of the electrons, one
can write H as the sum of two one-particle Hamiltonians. The product states
|ψ = |n1 l1 m1 |n2 l2 m2
are then eigenstates of H, where the states |ni li mi are eigenstates of H(i),
i.e., hydrogenic states with Z = 2 (for He). This implies

The (n1 , n2 ) = (2, 2)-state has a higher energy than the singly ionized
(1, ∞)-state and is not a bound state, as is true of all the further ones.
In the bound, excited states, one of the electrons has the principal quantum
number 1. One sees the (2,2)-state however as a resonance in the He+ – e
scattering cross section. The energy spectrum of Fig. 13.2 thus results.

(schematic); zero at the ionization energy

We must now take into account the Pauli principle, that is, the antisymmetry of the total wave function, which is the product of the coordinate
function and the spin state |S, ms . The spin states of the two electrons are
the three symmetric triplet states and the antisymmetric singlet state. The

13.2 Helium

235

spatial part of the state must be respectively an antisymmetric or a symmetric combination of the spatial eigenfunctions |n1 l1 m1 |n2 l2 m2 .
For historical reasons, the following designations for these two classes of
states are customary:
Parahelium: Spatial wave function symmetric, spin singlet (antisymmetric)
|0 = |100 |100 |0, 0 ,
1
√ (|100 |2lm + |2lm |100 )|0, 0
2

.

.

(13.22a)

Orthohelium: Spatial part of the wave function antisymmetric, spin triplet
(symmetric). The antisymmetrization of |100 |100 gives zero; therefore, the
lowest spin triplet state is
1
√ (|100 |2lm − |2lm |100 )|1, ms
2

.

(13.22b)

Remark: The two Slater determinants
1

√ (|100|2lm |↑↓ − |2lm|100 |↓↑) and √ (|100|2lm |↓↑ − |2lm|100 |↑↓)

2
satisfy the Pauli principle as well, but they are not eigenfunctions of the total spin.
In both of these degenerate states, the Coulomb interaction V is not diagonal. In
contrast, the nondiagonal matrix elements of V vanish for the degenerate eigenstates of the total spin (13.22a) and (13.22b). Therefore, (13.22a,b) are appropriate
unperturbed states for perturbation theory. See Sect. 11.1.2.

13.2.2 Energy Shift

It suﬃces to compute ΔEnl
for m = 0, since the result is independent of m
due to the vanishing commutator [L, 1/|x1 − x2 |] = 0, where L = L1 + L2 is
the total angular momentum. The two terms in the energy shift Jnl and Knl
can be interpreted as follows: Jnl is the electrostatic interaction of the two
charge distributions |ψ100 (x1 )|2 and |ψnl0 (x2 )|2 , and it is of course positive.
Knl is the exchange term, which comes from the antisymmetrization of the
wave function.

(13.29)

Because of the Pauli principle, the energy shift depends on the spin state.
However, this eﬀective spin–spin interaction is of purely electrostatic origin.
The quantity Knl is also positive, since the antisymmetric spatial wave function must have lower energy due to the smaller electron–electron interaction.
This must of course be checked formally (see remark).

13.2.2.3 Comparison of the 1s2s- and 1s2p-States
and the Inﬂuence of the Spin–Orbit Interaction
The main eﬀect of the Coulomb repulsion of the electrons may be interpreted
in the following manner. The 2s and 2p electrons feel a Coulomb potential
screened by the 1s electron. Since the 2s electron has a nonzero probability of
being at the nucleus, it is eﬀected by the screening less than the 2p electron,
E1s2p > E1s2s . The additional splitting of the 1s2s- and 1s2p-levels is caused
by the exchange interaction (13.29). See Fig. 13.3. The triplet levels are below
the corresponding singlets, due to the antisymmetric spatial wave functions
and consequent diminuation of the Coulomb interaction.
Due to the spin–orbit coupling S · L = (J 2 − L2 − S 2 )/2, the parahelium
levels are not split (2S + 1 = 1), whereas the orthohelium levels with L ≥ 1
are split threefold (2S + 1 = 3), e.g., L = 1, J = 2, 1, 0. In Fig. 13.3, we

illustrate the level shift and in Fig. 13.4, the level diagram up to the 4F
states. We use spectroscopic notation 2S+1 LJ , where L is the total orbital
angular momentum, S the total spin, and J the total angular momentum.
The splitting by the exchange interaction is of O(10−1 eV) and by the spin–
orbit coupling O(10−4 eV).
The energy levels of helium, and in particular the absence of a triplet
1S-state, could not be understood at all in the context of Bohr’s theory; it
was not until the advent of quantum theory together with the Pauli principle
that an explanation became possible. In the early days of spectroscopy and
atomic theory, it was suspected that helium was a mixture of two kinds of
helium atoms. This came from the distinct splittings (singlet and triplet)
and from the fact that no radiative transitions were found between paraand orthohelium. The triplet splitting of the radiative transitions within the
orthostates was easier to reconcile with the Bohr quantum theory; thus the
designation ortho and para. In Chap. 15 we will discuss the coupling to the
radiation ﬁeld p · A(x, t). This does not contain the spin, and hence one
has for electric dipole and quadrupole, as well as magnetic transitions the
selection rule
ΔS = 0

,

13.2 Helium

239

where ΔS = Sf −Si is the diﬀerence between the spin quantum numbers after
(Sf ) and before (Si ) the transition. Transitions from ortho- to parahelium
are thus impossible, and in particular the 3 S1 state is (meta-) stable. The
magnetic coupling of the spin to the radiation ﬁeld

−μB
S i · B(xi , t) ,
which would allow a change in S, does not give a contribution in ﬁrst order
either, since para- and orthohelium states have diﬀerent spatial symmetry
and B is symmetric. It has already been mentioned that the (1s2s) 3 S1 state
is metastable. We would like to indicate which further processes and higher
transitions of low transition probability are possible. Orthohelium can form
from parahelium due to bombardment with electrons. In the atmosphere it
is important that irradiation of parahelium with UV light takes the state
(1s1s) 1 S0 into (1s2p) 1 P1 (see Fig. 13.4). Collisions of (1s2p) 1 P1 atoms can
give the orthohelium state (1s2p) 3 P . This state can make an electric dipole
transition to the (1s2s) 3 S1 level, because the electric dipole transitions are
restricted only by the selection rules
Δl = lf − li = ± 1 ,

The lowest ortholevel (1s2s) 3 S1 is metastable with lifetime τ = 104 s. The
transition into the ground state occurs through a spin dependent, relativistic
magnetic dipole transition.6 The (1s2s) 1 S0 level is also metastable with
the lifetime τ = 19.7 ms, since no electric dipole transition to (1s1s) 1 S0
is possible. The most important decay mechanism is a two-photon electric
dipole transition.7

13.2.3 The Variational Method
The ground state energy can be calculated much more precisely by means
of the Ritz variational method of Sect. 11.2 than by means of perturbation
theory. In guessing an appropriate form for the wave function, we wish to
take into account the fact that each electron sees an eﬀectively lower charge
number Z ∗ due to screening by the other electron. We therefore make the

The ﬁrst two terms coincide with ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, while the
third lowers the energy relative to ﬁrst-order perturbation theory.
For Z = 2 (He), E0 = −5.7 Ry = −77.48 eV, is a signiﬁcant improvement
compared to ﬁrst-order perturbation theory (13.27a,b). However, for H− , the
result is still qualitatively wrong, because −0.945 Ry > −1Ry, i.e., H− would
be unstable to the decay H− → H + e− , whereas in fact H− is just barely
stable. Incidentally, in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics,
it can be proven exactly that H−− is unstable and H− is stable.
In order to improve the variational computation, one should take into
account the dependence of the wave function on the distance between the
particles. Such computations have been carried out using a large number of
variational parameters (∼ 200) with fantastic precision8 . It is then also necessary to take into account the motion of the nucleus. After transforming to
the center-of-mass frame, the electron mass is replaced by the reduced mass
(μ = M m/(M + m)), and a term (1/M )P 1 · P 2 enters, in which M is the
nuclear mass. However, going beyond helium, the number of variational parameters gets larger and larger with increasing electron number, and instead
it turns out to be more eﬃcient to utilize methods in which the inﬂuence of
the remaining electrons on a particular electron is represented by an average
ﬁeld (potential).

13. Several-Electron Atoms

Considering our experience with the helium atom, it is hopeless to look for
an exact solution of the Schrödinger equation for more than two electrons.
The situation is simplest in atoms which are similar to hydrogen, i.e., excitations of Li, Na, . . . or for highly excited states (Rydberg states). Such an
electron, because of screening due to the other electrons, moves eﬀectively in
a Coulomb ﬁeld with charge number 1. The corrections due to the extension
of the screening electron cloud lead to the replacement in (6.24 ) for the hydrogen levels of n with n + Δl , where Δl depends only on l but not on n. We
will not go into this special case, which was important in the initial phase of
atomic physics, but now discuss the method of the self-consistent ﬁeld, that
is, the Hartree and Hartree–Fock approximations.
One starts from the physical picture that an arbitrary electron of the atom
eﬀectively feels, in addition to the nuclear potential, a potential due to the
rest of the electrons, so that each electron can be described by a one-particle
Schrödinger equation. The potential in these Schrödinger equations depends
on the wave functions of the other electrons and must be determined selfconsistently. In the Hartree approximation, the wave function is assumed to
take the form of a product of one-particle wave functions. The wave function
is not antisymmetric. The Pauli exclusion principle is taken into account to
the extent that all factors are distinct from one another. In the Hartree–Fock
approximation, the wave function is a Slater determinant.
13.3.1 The Hartree Approximation
Here one writes the wave function in the form of a product,
ψ(1, . . . , N ) = ϕ1 (1)ϕ2 (2) . . . ϕN (N ) ,

(13.37a)

where the one-particle wave functions
ϕi (i) = ϕi (xi )χi (msi )

(13.37b)

are products of spatial and spin states. The state (13.37a) is not antisymmetric. In order to take the Pauli exclusion principle at least partly into
account, the one-particle states must be distinct and orthogonal. We now determine the wave function by means of the Ritz variational principle, where
the normalization

d3 x|ϕi (x)|2 = 1
(13.38)
constitutes a constraint, which is taken into account by a Lagrange multiplier
εi . We must then minimize

where the expectation value is formed using the Hartree state (13.37a). We
seek here the state which is stationary, not only under variation of parameters,
but also under variation of the one-particle wave functions. We must thus
construct the functional derivative δ/δϕi (x) of (13.39).
We recall the deﬁnition of the functional derivative

Equation (13.43) is easy to interpret and could have been guessed even without the variational calculation. The ﬁrst two terms are the kinetic energy and
the nuclear potential, and the third term is the electrostatic potential due to
the charge distribution of the other electrons. The Hartree equation for ϕi
contains in the potential all the other wave functions. These nonlinear equations can be solved self-consistently for atoms only by numerical methods, i.e.,
one assumes functions ϕ1 . . . ϕN , determines the Vi using (13.44), and then
solves (13.43). With the new wave functions, one again computes the Vi and
continues the iteration until no further change occurs. (The Hartree approximation is trivial only for translationally invariant problems.) A simpliﬁcation
of the solution of the Hartree equations results if Vi (x) is approximated by
the spherically symmetric potential

The ﬁrst three terms in (13.54) excluding j = i can be interpreted as in the
Hartree equation as the Hamiltonian of an electron in the Coulomb potential
screened by the charge density of the other electrons. The fourth term is the
exchange term. This is a nonlocal term, since here ϕi occurs with argument
x = x. The exchange term is nonzero only for msi = msj . The expression
in square brackets in (13.54) is then the probability amplitude for ﬁnding i
and j at the positions x and x .
Remark: One easily sees that the Hartree–Fock states are orthogonal: The state
ϕi (xi )χi (msi ) is orthogonal to all states with msj = msi . The spatial wave functions ϕj with msj = msi all satisfy a Schrödinger equation with exactly the same

the assumption that the other wave functions do not change. The larger the
particle number, the better this is satisﬁed. A corresponding result was found
for εi in the Hartree theory. The Hartree–Fock equations give in comparison
to the Hartree equations an improvement of 10–20 %. The exchange term
lowers the energy.

13.4 The Thomas–Fermi Method
For atoms with many electrons, computation of the Hartree or Hartree–Fock
wave functions is very tedious. On the other hand, physical considerations
give rise to a simpliﬁcation. Because of the large number of electrons, each
one feels just the same eﬀective potential, constant in time, arising due to
the other electrons and the nucleus. Furthermore, most of the electrons are in
states of high energy, i.e., large principal quantum number, so that the wavelength is small and the change of the potential relative to its value is slight
within one wavelength. We can then utilize a semiclassical approximation
and assume that there are many electrons within volume elements in which
the potential is nearly constant, that their states are locally plane waves, and
that their distribution can be determined on the basis of the results (13.17)
for free fermions.
We start from the Hartree potential Vi (x), Eqn. (13.44), and, because of
the large number of electrons, we may include in the sum also the state ϕi (x).
Then one and the same potential acts on all electrons

Locally, the states are semiclassical plane waves eip(x)·x/ , where /|p(x)|
is small compared to the spatial variation of V (x), except in the vicinity of the
classical turning points. The connection between energy and local momentum

(13.59)

At each point x, the states with local momentum between 0 and a maximal
value |pF (x)| are occupied. Denoting the energy of the highest occupied state
by εF , we ﬁnd for the Fermi momentum
|pF (x)| = (2m(εF − V (x))1/2

.

The particle number density at the point x then becomes, according to
(13.17),

(13.61)

We next determine εF . The atomic radius R is obtained from V (R) = εF .
Now, in a neutral atom, the electrons screen oﬀ the nuclear charge, and
V (r) = 0 must hold for r > R (Fig. 13.5), which implies εF = 0. (In the case
of an ion, V (r) = −(Z − N )e2 /r for r > R.)
Below, we consider only neutral atoms. Substituting εF = 0 into (13.60)
and (13.61), we ﬁnd
n(x) =

(13.62)

The density or the potential must now be determined self-consistently. For
this purpose, one could solve the integral equation (13.58b) in conjunction
with (13.62). Equivalently, applying the operator ∇ to (13.58b) one derives
the Poisson equation
ΔV (x) = −4πe2 n(x) + 4πZe2 δ (3) (x) ,

(13.63)

which gives together with (13.62) n(x) or V (x), respectively. By radial symmetry, one has for ﬁnite r

The extension of the atom is inﬁnite, an obviously unphysical feature. The
form of V (r) and n(r) is the same for all atoms, because χ is a universal
function. The typical length scale is ∼ Z −1/3 . Numerical solution shows that
half of the electrons are within the radius 1.33 aZ −1/3.
We can now estimate the validity of the Thomas–Fermi approximation.
The radius is ∼ Z −1/3 and decreases with growing Z, the potential at a
ﬁxed distance is ∼ Z 4/3 , and therefore, from (13.60), the typical wavelength
is ∼ Z −2/3 . The characteristic length over which the potential changes signiﬁcantly is ∼ Z −1/3 . Hence, the ratio of the latter two quantities is Z −1/3 .
The larger Z, the smaller this ratio becomes. In this limit, the statistical

by d3 xn(x) = Z, one ﬁnds the proportionality E ∼ Epot ∼ −Z 7/3 . Numerical computation gives E = −20.8 Z 7/3 eV.
Thomas–Fermi theory has the following shortcomings: It is inaccurate
for small r, since the variation of the potential is too strong there. It is
also inaccurate for large distances, since there the wavelength is no longer
small, because the diﬀerence between the energy and the potential goes to
zero. Moreover, the density gets small, and a statistical treatment becomes
unjustiﬁed. This is the origin of the unphysical inﬁnitely large atomic radius.
However, most of the electrons lie in the region a/Z < r < a, and in this
region Thomas–Fermi theory is reliable.
One can also build exchange eﬀects into Thomas–Fermi theory; the result
is then the Thomas–Fermi–Dirac equation11 :

For Z → ∞, it is identical to the Thomas–Fermi equation. The solutions
of (13.71) are no longer universal, but rather depend on Z. We also mention
a computation of the one-electron states as a function of Z for the Thomas–
Fermi(–Dirac) potential12 . The energy of the orbitals for the Thomas–FermiDirac potential is shown in Fig. 13.8 as a function of Z. This theory shows
the ﬁlling of the energy levels with increasing Z in the order 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s,
3p, 4s, 3d. One also sees the approximate degeneracy of 4s and 3d in the
region 20 < Z < 30 (iron group). The ﬁlling of the levels continues between
Z = 31 (Ga) and Z = 36 (Kr) with the 4p-shell. The 5s-shell then follows,
and then the 4d-shell. For the Thomas–Fermi potential, instead the 5p-shell
would be ﬁlled ﬁrst after Z = 39.

13.5 Atomic Structure and Hund’s Rules
The eﬀective potential of the Hartree and Hartree–Fock equations is not a
1/r-potential. In a good ﬁrst approximation, however, the potential can be
assumed spherically symmetric. The energy eigenvalues εnl now depend on
l, and the one-electron wave functions are
ϕi = Rnl (r)Ylml (ϑ, ϕ)χ(ms ) ,
χ(ms ) = χ±

(13.72)

,

where Rnl is to be determined (respectively) from the Hartree or Hartree–
Fock equations. The eigenfunctions with angular momentum l are labeled
with increasing energy by n (n = l + 1, l + 2, . . . ) (Fig. 13.9).

Fig. 13.9. Numbering of energy levels

For each ﬁxed pair of n and l, there are (2S + 1)(2l + 1) = 2(2l + 1)
diﬀerent states (orbitals) (Table 13.3). The set of these 2(2l + 1) one-electron
states is called a shell. (Notation: (n, l), where, as in the hydrogen atom, for
l = 0, 1, 2, . . . one uses the symbols s, p, d, . . .). For example, the 1s-shell has
two states, 2p-shell six states, etc.
By ﬁlling the orbitals one after the other in successive shells, one gets
all the elements of the periodic table. See page 413. The electronic state
of an atom is characterized by specifying the occupied orbitals, or, as it is
often called, the conﬁguration. For example, in carbon C (1s)2 (2s)2 (2p)2 two
electrons are in the 1s-shell, two in the 2s-shell and two in the 2p-shell. The
conﬁgurations of the lightest elements are

For given n, orbitals s, p, . . . are successively ﬁlled. The smaller l is, the larger
the probability density at the nucleus, and the less the electron in question
is aﬀected by the screening due to the other electrons. Below, we no longer
give the orbitals of the inner ﬁlled shells. Continuing the conﬁgurations of
the periodic table begun above, we skip the elements carbon C to ﬂuorine F,
in which the 2p-shell is successively ﬁlled. With neon, the 2p-shell is closed:
Ne (2p)6 .
From sodium Na to argon Ar the 3s and 3p-shells are ﬁlled, in analogy
to 2s and 2p. However, the further progression does not begin with the 3dshell, but rather at potassium K a 4s-electron follows, and the periodic table
proceeds further in the following manner (E4s ≈ E3d ):
K
Ca
Sc

4s
(4s)2
(4s)2 3d.

In the transition metals of row IV, from scandium Sc to zinc Zn, the 3dshell is ﬁlled. Now, after all the orbitals with n = 3 have been used up,
the occupation continues with the 4p-shell. The corresponding elements are
chemically similar to the 3p-elements above them in the periodic table.
Row V of the periodic table is ﬁlled analogously, i.e., the 4f -states remain
empty at ﬁrst.
Row VI begins with Cs 6s, Ba 6s2 , La 6s2 5d; however, it is not continued
with the completion of the 5d-shell but rather the 4f -shell is successively
built up. The ﬁrst element after lanthanum is Ce 6s2 5d 4f . After this ﬁlling
process has been completed with Lu 6s2 5d 4f 14 , the transition metals of the
5d-shell are formed in the sequence from Hf 6s2 5d2 4f 14 onwards.
The structure of row VII corresponds to that of row VI. After actinium
Ac 7s2 6d, from protactinium Pa 6d 5f 2 onwards the 5f -shell is ﬁlled in competition with 6d.
The elements in which d or f -shells are being ﬁlled are called transition
elements. The elements in which the d-shells are being ﬁlled are called transition metals (3d-iron group, 4d-paladium group and 5d-platinum group).
The elements following lanthanum are the lanthanides or rare earths,
and those following actinium are the actinides. Note that in the rare earth
elements Gd and Tb a 5d-orbital is again occupied. The important point is
that the chemical behavior of the transition elements is determined by the
most distant s-electrons. A consequence of this is that the rare earths are
closely related chemically and are easily substituted in crystals. In general,
chemical behavior is determined by the outer electrons and is therefore similar
in a given column of the periodic table.
We now discuss the ionization potential, which is the binding energy of
the most weakly bound electron.
Atoms with an s-electron outside of closed shells have the lowest binding
energy (H, Li, Na, . . . ). The second s-electron is more strongly bound (He,

254

13. Several-Electron Atoms

Fig. 13.10. The ionization potential as function of Z

Be, Mg, . . . ) because of the higher nuclear charge. The next electron occupies
the otherwise empty p-shell, which is associated with a drop in the binding
energy (B, Al). As the p-shell is built up, the binding energy grows at ﬁrst,
until with the fourth electron, which must be added to the half-ﬁlled shell,
another drop occurs. This circumstance can be explained by the fact that up
to the third electron all the spins are aligned in parallel and thus the three
diﬀerent spatial wave functions can become completely antisymmetric. The
fourth electron has oppositely aligned spin, and the spatial wave function is
no longer totally antisymmetric. From Ga on, a similar picture again occurs
(Fig. 13.10).
Now that we know the electron conﬁgurations of the elements, we must
determine the quantum number L of the total orbital angular momentum
L=

N


Li

i=1

and the quantum number S of the total spin
S=

N


Si

.

i=1

If a shell is not completely ﬁlled, several values for S and L are possible.
For the moment, we ignore the spin–orbit coupling, so that the Hamiltonian is given by (13.35); then the angular momentum commutes with the
Hamiltonian, [H, L] = 0, and L is thus a good quantum number. The eigenstates of H are simultaneously eigenstates of L2 and Lz ; by rotational invariance, the energy does not depend on Lz .

13.5 Atomic Structure and Hund’s Rules

255

Although [H, S i ] = 0 for every single S i , after antisymmetrization the
eigenfunctions are only eigenfunctions of S 2 and Sz . The energy also depends
on S, because the larger S, the more antisymmetric the spatial wave function
and the smaller the mutual Coulomb repulsion among the electrons.
Thus far, only the Coulomb interaction has been taken into account. With
spin–orbit coupling, the quantum numbers are L, S, J, where J = L + S is
the total angular momentum. The values of J are L+S, . . . |L−S|. These are
2S + 1 values for L > S and 2L + 1 for L < S. For L ≥ S, the multiplicity of
the energy terms with orbital angular momentum L is 2S+1. Since the energy
depends on J, the levels belonging to an L and S split into a 2S +1-multiplet.
Which of these states has the lowest energy? The answer is important for
an understanding of the magnetic properties of atoms and ions. By means
of the Hund’s semiempirical rules, which are based on simple physical arguments, one can determine the ground state.
Hund’s Rules
Taking into account the Pauli exclusion principle, the states are occupied
such that
1. S is maximal,
2. L is maximal,
3. for shells, not more than half-ﬁlled 2S+1 LJ=|L−S|, while for more than
half-ﬁlled shells 2S+1 LJ=L+S .
We indicate the reasons for Hund’s rules.
1. The larger the spin, the more antisymmetric the spatial part of the
wave function and the smaller the Coulomb interaction, since the spatial
wave function vanishes for vanishing particle separation, which is where the
Coulomb interaction would have been strongest.
2. The larger the total orbital angular momentum, L, the farther the
electrons are separated from the center and therefore from each other as well.
Since the Coulomb interaction decreases with 1/r, the Coulomb repulsion
becomes smaller, though not as markedly as in 1.
3. According to (12.8), the spin–orbit interaction is of the form
VSO =



αi Li · S i with αi =

i

2
dV (ri )
2m2 c2 ri dri

,

where V (ri ) is the potential energy of the self-consistent ﬁeld.
Calculating ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, one ﬁnds for a state with
quantum numbers L and S
Li ∝ L

,

Si ∝ S

.

256

13. Several-Electron Atoms

The Hamiltonian is thus equivalent to VSO = A S · L with coeﬃcient A. From
S · L = 12 [J(J + 1) − L(L + 1) − S(S + 1)]
it follows that for A > 0 the most favorable value of J is |L − S|, whereas for
A < 0 the most favorable value of J is L + S. In computing A, we note that
the αi are positive and independent of ml . If only one shell is incompletely
ﬁlled, and if this one is at most half full, then according to Hund’s ﬁrst rule
the spins are parallel, i.e., S i = S/n, where n is the number of electrons.
Hence, the spin–orbit Hamiltonian becomes
VSO =



αi Li · S/n ∼

i

Therefore

.

For a shell which is more than half full, we imagine the empty conﬁgurations
to be ﬁrst completed and then removed
again. For the ﬁlled shell, one would
have VSO = 0. There remains VSO = − i αi Li S i , where one sums over
 the
holes. The 
total spin and the total angular momentum are S = − i S i
and L = − i Li . By the same argument as previously, it follows that A =
−α/2S. For an at most half-ﬁlled shell, A > 0 and J = |L − S|, whereas for
a more than half-ﬁlled shell, A < 0 and J = L + S. For a half-ﬁlled shell
of orbitals with angular momentum l, one has according to the ﬁrst two of
Hund’s rules S = (2l + 1)/2 and L = 0, and therefore L + S = |L − S| = S.
Let us apply Hund’s rules to a few examples:
–
–

–

–

He (1s)2 : In the ground state, S = 0, because of the antisymmetrization,
rather than S = 1, i.e., 1 S0 .
B (1s)2 (2s)2 2p: The closed 1s and 2s shells have J = L = S = 0. Thus,
S = 1/2 and L = 1; it remains to compare 2 P1/2 and 2 P3/2 . Since the
2p-shell is less than half full, one ﬁnds according to Hund’s third rule
2
P1/2 .
C (1s)2 (2s)2 (2p)2 : Hund’s ﬁrst rule demands S = 1. Now, by the Pauli
exclusion principle, L cannot be 2, since the two orbital angular momentum quantum numbers ml must diﬀer from one another. With ml = 0
and 1 as the maximal L, the value L = 1 results. Since the shell is less
than half full, Hund’s third rule selects from J = 0, 1, 2 the smallest value,
i.e., 3 P0 .
N (1s)2 (2s)2 (2p)3 : The maximal value of the spin is 3/2. The possible
values of L are 3, 2, 1, 0. Since the spin function is completely symmetric,
the spatial wave function must be completely antisymmetric, for which
one requires all three wave functions with ml = 1, 0, −1. Thus L = 0 and
J = 3/2 , i.e., 4 S3/2 .

Fig. 13.11. Splitting of the energy levels (schematic); the energy scale increases
to the right

The splitting of the levels within a conﬁguration comes from the Coulomb
interaction of the electrons and the spin–orbit interaction. The splitting is
illustrated schematically in Fig. 13.11.
In the above discussion, we have assumed that the Coulomb interaction of
the electrons is much larger than the spin–orbit coupling. In that case, L and
S are good quantum numbers and one speaks of L – S coupling or Russel–
Saunders coupling. This situation obtains in light atoms. If the spin–orbit
coupling dominates compared to L and S dependent parts of the Coulomb
energy, then each electron is characterized by its total angular momentum j.
The j are combined to form a J of the atom. This is called j–j coupling. The
j–j coupling is never realized in its pure form, even in heavy atoms.

14. The Zeeman Eﬀect and the Stark Eﬀect

We now return to our treatment of the theory of atomic levels in a magnetic
ﬁeld. In Sect. 7.3, we took only the orbital magnetic moment into account.
The lack of agreement of the so-called normal Zeeman eﬀect with experiment
led to the discovery of spin. We now consider the complete theory of the
Zeeman eﬀect, ﬁrst for the hydrogen atom, and then for multi-electron atoms.
In addition, the eﬀect of an electric ﬁeld on the energy levels of atoms will
be investigated in this chapter.

14.1 The Hydrogen Atom in a Magnetic Field
The Hamiltonian
H = HCoul + Hrel + HZ

(14.1)

consists of the Coulomb term HCoul from (12.1), the relativistic corrections
Hrel = H1 + H2 + H3 from Chap. 12, and the Zeeman term

where we choose the magnetic ﬁeld to point along the z-direction.
We will either work in a basis system in which the spin–orbit term S · L
contained in Hrel is diagonalized, treating the Zeeman term perturbatively,
or else the other way around, depending on the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld.
We recall that, in ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, Hrel leads to a ﬁnestructure energy shift

14. The Zeeman Eﬀect and the Stark Eﬀect

14.1.1 Weak Field
If the magnetic ﬁeld is weaker than 105 G, the Zeeman term can be regarded
as a perturbation compared to the relativistic corrections. The appropriate
parent states are then the states (14.4). The ﬁne-structure shift of the hydrogen levels due to the second term of H is given in (14.3).

.
(14.6)
2l + 1
All degenerate levels are split due to the magnetic ﬁeld. In contrast to the
“normal” Zeeman eﬀect, the magnitude of the splitting depends on l. The
Zeeman splitting is illustrated schematically in Fig. 14.1.

Fig. 14.1. The “Anomalous”
Zeeman eﬀect. The levels
l ± 1/2 are split by the ﬁeld
into 2l + 2 and 2l levels

We note that it was permissible to use nondegenerate perturbation theory.
For degenerate j, as for example in the case of the 2S1/2 and 2P1/2 levels,
the two spatial wave functions (here l = 0 and 1) have diﬀerent parity and
vanishing matrix element of HZ .
14.1.2 Strong Field, the Paschen–Back Eﬀect
If the ﬁeld is so strong that the Zeeman energy is large compared to that of
the relativistic correction term, we begin with the states
|n, l, ml |ms

with |ms = |↑

or |↓

which diagonalize HCoul and also HZ .

14.1.3 The Zeeman Eﬀect for an Arbitrary Magnetic Field
After these limiting cases, we now treat the hydrogen atom for an arbitrary
ﬁeld. For ﬁelds lying between the two extremes we have to apply degenerate perturbation theory to the sum Hrel + HZ . That is, we must ﬁnd linear
combinations of the states
|n, j = l ± 12 , mj , l
for which the oﬀ-diagonal elements of Hrel + HZ vanish. We start with
|n, j = l ± 12 , mj , l
because in these states the complicated part, Hrel , is diagonal (14.3). We
must also compute the matrix elements of HZ . These vanish for diﬀering n
and l; for example, from [L2 , Jz + Sz ] = 0, the relation
(l(l + 1) − l (l + 1)) . . . l|(Jz + Sz )| . . . l = 0
follows, so the matrix element of Jz + Sz can diﬀer from zero only for l = l.
From [HCoul , Jz + Sz ] = 0, the validity of the assertion also follows for the
quantum number n. From [Sz , Jz ] = 0 one further has the relation
(mj − mj ) . . . mj . . . |Sz | . . . mj . . . = 0 ,
so that all the matrix elements with diﬀering mj vanish. The structure of the
matrix Jz + Sz is characterized in Fig. 14.2 for (n ≥ 2) S1/2 , P1/2 , P3/2 by
dots for the non-zero matrix elements.
Using (10.28), the non-vanishing matrix elements are thus the diagonal

The states S1/2 , mj = ± 1/2 and P3/2 , mj = ± 3/2 occur only in diagonal elements and therefore for them there is no admixture due to HZ . Consequently,
for these states, and in general for

In this treatment, the diamagnetic term 8mc
(see Sects. 7.2
2 [x × B]
and 7.7) was not taken into account. This is justiﬁed as a rule for atoms
under laboratory conditions. As mentioned in Sect. 7.2, magnetic ﬁelds such
as those that prevail on the surface of neutron stars lead to signiﬁcant changes
in atomic structure because of the diamagnetic term.
These eﬀects are also important at shallow donor levels in semiconductors. A singly charged defect in a semiconductor binds an electron quite in
analogy to the hydrogen atom. However, the strength of Coulomb potential is
decreased by the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, V (r) = −e20 /(εr),
and the mass of the electron should be replaced by the eﬀective mass m∗ .
Therefore, the Rydberg constant is replaced by Ry = m∗ e40 /2ε2 2 , and
the cyclotron frequency by ωc = e0 B/m∗ c. In InSb (indium-antimonide),
2
m∗ = m/77 and ε = 15. The ratio ωc /Ry is thus increased by (ε/m∗ ) =
2
6
(15 × 77) ≈ 1.3 × 10 compared to the free hydrogen atom. It is not diﬃcult
to obtain a ratio of ωc /Ry ≈ 10, thus entering the regime in which the theory of hydrogen-like atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds1 becomes relevant under
laboratory conditions.

14.2 Multielectron Atoms
For multielectron atoms, we begin with the total orbital angular momentum
L and the total spin S of all electrons and their sum J = L + S. The Zeeman

14.2.1 Weak Magnetic Field
For a weak magnetic ﬁeld, the appropriate unperturbed states are
|J, MJ , L, S

.

(14.19)

These are eigenstates of J 2 , Jz , L2 and S 2 , but not of Sz , and we need Sz .
We cannot fall back on the Wigner–Eckhardt theorem here, which would
immediately give the ratio Jz / Sz , but rather we must make use of a short
elementary computation. We begin with the identity
S(L · S) − (L · S)S = −iS × L

The hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic ﬁeld is treated for example in the following papers: C. Alderich, R.L. Greene: Phys. Stat. Sol. (b) 93, 343 (1979); H.
Hasegawa: in Physics of Solids in Intense Magnetic Fields, ed. by E.D. Haidemenakis (Plenum, New York 1969) p. 246.

which follows from [Si , Sj ] = iεijk Sk , and form its exterior product with J :

.

(14.21)

Taking the expectation value of (14.21) in the state |J, MJ , L, S and using
the fact that L · S is diagonal, we ﬁnd that the left side vanishes and that
SJ 2 = J (S · J )

.

(14.22)

With S · J = (J 2 + S 2 − L2 )/2,

earlier result (14.6).

14. The Zeeman Eﬀect and the Stark Eﬀect

14.2.2 Strong Magnetic Field, the Paschen–Back Eﬀect
If the Zeeman energy exceeds the relativistic splitting, the appropriate basis
states are |L, ML , S, MS , in which L2 , Lz , S 2 , and Sz are diagonal and HZ
is as well. The energy splitting is then
ΔE = μB B(ML + 2MS ) + ζ(n, L, S)ML MS

.

(14.26)

This corresponds to the classical picture (Fig. 14.5) that S and L rotate
independently of one another about B, so that S, Sz , L, Lz , and Jz , but not
J, remain constant. Here as well, the second term originates from the spin–
orbit interaction.

magnetic ﬁeld

14.3 The Stark Eﬀect
We now investigate the inﬂuence of an external electric ﬁeld on the energy
levels of the hydrogen atom. The unperturbed Hamiltonian HCoul is given
in (12.1), and the perturbation
H1 = −eE · x = −eEz

(14.27)

represents the interaction of the electron with the electric ﬁeld E, taken to
point in the z-direction. Since the atomic electric ﬁeld is of the order of magnitude E0 /ea ≈ 1010 Vm−1 , perturbation theory can certainly be applied
for ﬁelds which are achievable in the laboratory.
We begin with a few statements, following from symmetry, concerning the
matrix elements n, l, m|z|n, l , m in the basis of eigenstates |n, l, m of the
Coulomb potential. From [Lz , z] = 0 it follows that
n, l, m|[Lz , z]|n , l , m = (m − m ) n, l, m|z|n , l , m = 0

,

and hence one has the selection rule
m = m

.

(14.28a)

14.3 The Stark Eﬀect

267

By considering the eﬀect of a reﬂection, one sees that the matrix element
n, l, m|z|n , l , m can only be ﬁnite for states of diﬀerent parity. In connection with electric dipole radiation, it is shown in Chap. 16 that
l = l ± 1

.

(14.28b)

Only when the “selection rules” (14.28a,b) are satisﬁed can the matrix element of z diﬀer from zero.
14.3.1 Energy Shift of the Ground State
By (14.28b), the contribution from ﬁrst-order perturbation theory vanishes
for the ground state of the hydrogen atom. The second order is
E12 =

(14.29)

where the selection rules (14.28a,b) have already been included, and where
the En denote the unperturbed energy levels of HCoul . Considering the typical
magnitude of atomic quantities, these energy shifts must be of order E12 ≈
−a3 E 2 , where a stands for the Bohr radius. The precise value is
E12 = − 94 a3 E 2

.

(14.30)

Comparison with (−1/2)αpE 2 immediately yields for the polarizability of the
hydrogen atom in the ground state
αp = 92 a3

.

(14.31)

Summarizing, we have that in the ground state there is no ﬁrst-order Stark
eﬀect, but only a second-order Stark eﬀect (ﬁrst and second order in E).
14.3.2 Excited States
The n = 2 states of the hydrogen atom |2, 0, 0 , |2, 1, 0 , |2, 1, 1 , |2, 1, −1
are four-fold degenerate. We must use degenerate perturbation theory and
transform to a basis in which the nondiagonal elements of z vanish.
By (14.28a) the two states |2, 1, ± 1 have no oﬀ-diagonal elements with
the other three states, and they remain unchanged in the new basis. Moreover,
since by (14.28b)
2, 1, ± 1|z|2, 1, ± 1 = 0

,

they are not shifted to ﬁrst order in E and give only a quadratic Stark eﬀect.
It remains to diagonalize the matrix formed from |2, 0, 0 and |2, 1, 0 , which

For these states, there exists a Stark eﬀect of ﬁrst order. The splitting in O(E)
is illustrated schematically in Fig. 14.6. A hydrogen atom in the ﬁrst excited
state behaves as if it had a dipole moment of magnitude 3ae0 orientable
parallel or antiparallel to the ﬁeld together with two states with no component
along the ﬁeld.

Fig. 14.6. Splitting of n = 2 states in ﬁrst order in E

We add a few remarks:
(i) The perturbation (14.27) breaks the rotational invariance. One has
[L2 , x] = 0, and therefore states with diﬀering l are mixed.
(ii) The ﬁne structure need not be taken into account for ﬁeld strengths
greater than 103 V/cm, since in this case the splitting due to the electric
ﬁeld is larger than the ﬁne-structure splitting. For weaker ﬁelds, one should
begin with the eigenstates of J . In linear combinations of the states 2S1/2
and 2P1/2 one then also ﬁnds a ﬁrst-order Stark eﬀect.

Problems

269

Fig. 14.7. The potential for the
Stark eﬀect, e = −e0

(iii) There is a fundamental objection to the use of perturbation theory
for the Stark eﬀect: Strictly speaking, as is evident from Fig. 14.7, the bound
states are not stable, but only metastable. However, the tunneling probability
is so minute that perturbation theory suﬃces to compute the location of these
metastable levels.
(iv) Finally, we wish to draw some general conclusions from the results
for the hydrogen atom. For nondegenerate levels there is no permanent dipole
moment, but only an induced one. For degenerate states of diﬀerent parity,
permanent dipole moments can occur. In any case, exact degeneracy is present
only in the Coulomb potential because of the additional symmetry generated
by the Lenz vector.
On the other hand, it is clear physically that in the case of closely spaced
levels of diﬀerent parity, a permanent dipole moment is in eﬀect present. This
is the situation in molecules like HCl and NH3 . The ground state of these
molecules is symmetric. The antisymmetric state lies barely higher in energy.
From these two states, it is possible to form a linear combination with ﬁnite
dipole moment d, which actually occurs if the energy Ed is much larger than
the aforementioned energy diﬀerence.

Problems
14.1 On the Stark eﬀect: Calculate the second-order energy shift for the ground
state of hydrogen E12 , Eqs. (14.29)–(14.30).
Hint: Instead of carrying out the summation in (14.29), derive a diﬀerential equation
for the ﬁrst-order perturbative correction to the wave function (method of Dalgarno
and Lewis: A. Dalgarno and J. T. Lewis, Proc. Roy. Soc. (London) A233, 70 (1955)).

15. Molecules

15.1 Qualitative Considerations
The basic building blocks of molecules are nuclei and electrons; however, since
they dissociate into atoms if energy is supplied, it seems reasonable to regard
them as bound states of atoms. The determination of the energy levels and
even the ground states of molecules is considerably more complicated than
in the case of atoms. The electrons move in an attractive, non-rotationally
symmetric potential generated by the nuclei. One should also think about to
what extent the motion of the nucleus should be taken into account. Here, an
important simpliﬁcation occurs for the theory of molecules, due to the small
ratio of the electron mass m to the nuclear mass M :1
m
≈ 10−3 − 10−5 .
(15.1)
M
Therefore the nuclei move more slowly, have a small zero-point energy, and
hence are well localized. At any time, the electrons “see” eﬀectively a static
potential. The electronic wave functions are adiabatically deformed by the
vibrations of the nuclei.
The nuclei of a molecule can carry out the following motions: translation,
rotation, and vibration. In order to estimate the typical energies of these
motions, we ﬁrst consider the typical electronic energy of a valence electron,
that is, an electron whose wave function extends over the whole molecule. If
the linear dimension of the molecule is a, then according to the uncertainty
relation and the virial theorem,

In estimating the vibrational energy, we note that the potential energy for
every normal mode of oscillation (eigenoscillation of the molecule) takes the
oscillator form M ω 2 R2 /2, where M is roughly the nuclear mass and R is the
amplitude of the oscillation. For R ≈ a, the energy would be about Eel , that

The frequencies of the transitions between electronic levels lie in the visible
and ultraviolet, the vibrational transitions in the infrared, and the rotational
transitions in the far infrared. From the vibrational frequency, we can also
estimate the typical nuclear velocity and the amplitude of the vibrations (the
mean-square deviation). The zero-point energy is composed in equal measures
of kinetic and potential energy, that is,

(15.7b)

The ﬁrst two terms in H stand for the kinetic energy of the electrons and
nuclei, while the next three stand for the interaction of the electrons, the
interaction of the electrons with the nuclei, and the interaction of the nuclei,
respectively. The momenta and coordinates of the nuclei are P N and X N ,
and those of the electrons are pi and xi .
Before considering the total wave function of the electrons and the nuclei,
let us ﬁrst ignore the nuclear motion completely, i.e., we ﬁx the coordinates
X. The wave function of the electrons ψ(x|X) for ﬁxed nuclear positions X
is then determined by
(Te + Vee + VeN )ψ(x|X) = E el (X)ψ(x|X)

.

(15.8)

In the wave function ψ(x|X) and in E el (X), the nuclear positions enter only
as parameters. We introduce
ε(X) = VNN (X) + E el (X) ,
the sum of the interaction energy of the nuclei and the energy eigenvalue of
the interacting electrons in the nuclear potential.
For the wave function of the whole molecule, we make the ansatz
Ψ (x, X) = ψ(x|X)Φ(X ) ,

(15.9)

which is the product of a wave function for the nuclei and the wave function
of the electrons for ﬁxed nuclei. From HΨ = EΨ follows
ψ(x|X)(TN + VNN (X) + E el (X))Φ(X) = ψ(x|X)EΦ(X )

We multiply (15.10) by ψ(x|X)∗ and integrate over x. Ignoring the terms
following from the second line, we ﬁnd the Born–Oppenheimer equation,
(TN + ε(X))Φ(X) = EΦ(X) .

(15.11)

The Born–Oppenheimer equation, the eﬀective Schrödinger equation for the
nuclei, contains – aside from the Coulomb repulsion – the energy of the electrons, which depends on the nuclear positions. The equilibrium coordinates

274

15. Molecules

of the nuclei are obtained from the minima of the ε(X). The nuclei arrange
themselves in such a way that the sum of their Coulomb repulsion and the
electronic energy attains a minimum. The oscillation frequencies of the nuclei
are obtained from the second derivatives of ε(X).
We must now estimate the terms neglected above. The second term in
the second line of (15.10) is

In the above derivation of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, only a
single electronic state ψ(x|X) was taken into account. However, one should
investigate whether the admixture of other electronic states could play a role.
For instance, in the evalution of the nuclear motion in the electronic ground
state, matrix elements with excited states might be important. The starting
point for a systematic treatment is the completely general expansion

(TN + VNN + Eαel (X) − E)Φα (X) = 0

Here, we have neglected the terms originating from the right side of (15.14).
These are now to be estimated. The second term contains

The neglected matrix elements are smaller than the electronic energy by
factors of m/M and (m/M )1/2 . They are therefore much smaller than the
separations of the electronic levels and lead merely to a negligible correction.
Neglecting terms in this manner, we have recovered in (15.15) the Born–
Oppenheimer equation. The nuclei move in an eﬀective potential composed of
the nuclear repulsion and the electronic energy. Hence we obtain independent
Born–Oppenheimer equations for Φα (X) corresponding to each ψα (x|X).
The energy eigenvalues of the molecule Eαn following from (15.15) depend
on α and are enumerated by n, and the corresponding stationary states of
the molecule are of the form
Ψαn (x, X) = ψα (x|X) Φαn (X)

In the following, we will compute the electronic energy for ﬁxed nuclear
positions. The minima yield the molecular bound states.

In Fig. 15.2 ε± (R) is shown as a function of the separation R. Now, ε+ (R) has
a minimum, but ε− (R) does not. From this one can see that the symmetric
wave function leads to binding and the antisymmetric wave function does not.
In the region between the nuclei, ψ+ (x) is larger than ψ− (x), which vanishes

in the plane bisecting the line connecting the nuclei. The diﬀerence in the
electronic energies is explained by the fact that the potential energy there is
relatively strongly attractive due to the positive superposition of the nuclear
potentials. For further illustration, in Fig. 15.3 ε± (R) − e2 /R is shown, that
is, the purely electronic energy without the Coulomb repulsion of the nuclei.
The state ψ+ is called a bonding orbital and ψ− an antibonding orbital.
The exact ground state energy is lower than ε+ (R). The values of the
binding energy and the nuclear separations of H+
2 are 2.79 eV and 1.06 Å,
compared to the variational results of 1.76 eV and 1.32 Å, respectively.3

Fig. 15.4. The hydrogen molecule

From the point of view of one of the two electrons, the following picture
emerges: In addition to the potential of the nuclei, there is a repulsive potential of the other electron. If the other electron is in a symmetric state, then a
weaker symmetric potential results. The wave function of the electron under
consideration is either symmetric or antisymmetric. Here as well, there are
antisymmetric (antibonding) and symmetric (bonding) wave functions (orbitals). If a particular symmetric, molecular, one-electron state is occupied
by two electrons with oppositely aligned spins, one expects for the binding
energy of the hydrogen molecule EH2 the result
|EH2 | < 2|EH+ | ,
2

where EH+ is the binding energy of the ionized hydrogen molecule.
2

3

The binding energy EH+ is given relative to the dissociated state, p + H, i.e.:
2
EH+ = Emin + 1 Ry, where Emin is the energy at the minimum (Fig. 15.2).
2
Because of (11.15), the above calculation gives an upper bound to the binding energy. This can be improved by introducing the variational parameter Z ∗
into (15.18) (see Problem 15.1).

15.4 The Hydrogen Molecule H2

279

There exist two basic approximation schemes for treating the H2 problem:
One method consists in the construction of molecular orbitals, that is, oneparticle wave functions for the molecule, which are occupied by electrons. The
other approach is the Heitler–London method, which consists in constructing the two-particle wave functions from the one-electron wave functions of
(isolated) hydrogen atoms.
The molecular orbital method
Here, the ansatz for the wave function of the two electrons is
ψs (1, 2) = [ψA (x1 ) + ψB (x1 )][ψA (x2 ) + ψB (x2 )]
× χsing /2[1 + S(R)] .

(15.26)

The spatial part is the product of the H+
2 molecule wave functions ψ+ (x1 )
and ψ+ (x2 ). The spins are in the singlet state because of the Pauli exclusion
principle. A triplet state can only be constructed by
√
[ψ+ (x1 )ψ− (x2 ) − ψ− (x1 )ψ+ (x2 )]χtrip / 2 .
It contains an antibonding orbital and has higher energy.
The ansatz (15.26) has the following shortcomings: For small distances,
the wave function is a product of 1s hydrogen wave functions instead of
helium wave functions. For larger distances, a further weakness becomes apparent. For this we consider the fully expanded expression
ψs (1, 2) ∝ [ψA (x1 )ψA (x2 ) + ψB (x1 )ψB (x2 )]
+ [ψA (x1 )ψB (x2 ) + ψA (x2 )ψB (x1 )]

.

In the terms within the ﬁrst pair of square brackets, both electrons are concentrated about the same atom. However, for large separations only the second pair of brackets should be present, because H + H is energetically more
favorable than p + H− . Nevertheless, this wave function gives a reasonably
accurate upper bound for the binding energy, since for this quantity only the
behavior in the vicinity of the actual molecular separation of the nuclei is of
relevance.

is given by the symmetric and antisymmetric superposition of single-atom
states. For large distances |X A − X B |, these states describe separated hydrogen atoms, which represents an improvement over the method of molecular
orbitals. For small distances, the same criticism as in the method of molecular orbitals applies. The quantitative diﬀerence in the binding energies of the
states (15.26) and (15.27a) is relatively small.
The expectation value of the Hamiltonian H in the Heitler–London
states (15.27a,b) gives the following upper bound for the true energy:

The Coulomb and exchange energy depend on the nuclear separation. The
Coulomb energy Q is positive and everywhere small. Except for very small
distances, the exchange energy is negative and exceeds the Coulomb energy;
thus, the singlet state is binding, but not the triplet state. Physically, this
results from the fact that for the singlet function the spatial probability density is large in between the two nuclei, whereas in the triplet state it has a
node in the midplane bisecting the line connecting the nuclei. Although the
Coulomb repulsion of the electrons in the singlet state is larger, this is overcompensated by the attraction of the charge distribution in the internuclear
region by the nuclei to the left and right. Quantitatively, this computation
is unsatisfactory; for the nuclear distance, one ﬁnds R0 = 0.8 × 10−8 cm in
place of the experimental value 0.7395 × 10−8 cm. Nevertheless, it shows the
origin of the homopolar bonding of the hydrogen molecule.

15.5 Energy Levels of a Two-Atom Molecule:
Vibrational and Rotational Levels
In the two preceding sections, we determined the eﬀective potential energy
of the nuclei and its minimum. Of course, one can just as well compute the
excited states of the nuclei from the Born–Oppenheimer equation. In the
following, we would like to determine the oscillatory and rotational states
of two-atom molecules such as HCl. In this case, the Born–Oppenheimer
equation (15.11) is a two-particle Schrödinger equation, which as in Sect. 6.4
can be reduced to a one-particle Schrödinger equation by introducing centerof-mass and relative coordinates and separating oﬀ the center-of-mass part.
We denote the relative coordinate of nucleus 1 and 2 by x = X 1 − X 2 . The
Born–Oppenheimer equation (15.11) then yields

of the ratio of nuclear separation to oscillation amplitude (see (15.6)) and is
therefore exponentially small.

15. Molecules

The energy eigenvalues (15.44) consist of contributions from the eﬀective
electronic energy, the rotational energy, and the vibrational energy.
The rotational levels correspond to a wavelength of λ = 0.1 – 1 cm and lie
in the far infrared and microwave regions, whereas the vibrational levels lie
at a wavelength of λ = 2 × 10−3 – 3 × 10−3 cm in the infrared. The quantum
nature of these excitations manifests itself in a macroscopic property of gases,
the speciﬁc heat. The classical speciﬁc heat is 7kB /2 (three translational, two
rotational, and two vibrational degrees of freedom). This value is only found
at high temperatures. Experimentally, and on the basis of quantum statistics,
one ﬁnds that when the temperature is lowered, the vibrations freeze out ﬁrst
at 103 K followed then by the rotations.

15.6 The van der Waals Force
This is important in the noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and in compounds
of large molecules. The charge distribution of the noble gases is spherically
symmetric, but not static; for this reason, an interaction of ﬂuctuating dipole
moments occurs.
Qualitatively, we can imagine how the van der Waals interaction arises
between two atoms in the following manner: The ﬂuctuating dipole moment
of the ﬁrst atom induces a dipole moment in the second atom (Fig. 15.5).
The potential of the ﬁrst atom is p1 · x/r3 , and the electric ﬁeld of the ﬁrst
atom is

We now turn to the quantum mechanical theory of the van der Waals
interaction. We formulate this for two hydrogen atoms, and we denote the
coordinates and momenta of the two electrons by x1 (x2 ) and p1 (p2 ) and
the separation vector of the two nuclei by R. The Hamiltonian of the two
electrons is
H = H1 (x1 ) + H2 (x2 ) + W (x1 , x2 , R) ,

Here, En0 1 n2 = En1 + En2 , and the prime on the summation symbol indicates
that the sum is not taken over n1 = n2 = 0. For atoms without a dipole
moment, such as hydrogen atoms in the ground state or noble gases, the
ﬁrst term vanishes. The second term is always negative; we estimate it for
hydrogen atoms. Choosing R in the x-direction, we can write the second term
in the form −e40 A/R6 with

The precise evaluation of the sum (15.50) by London and Eisenschitz gave
in place of the factor 6 in (15.51) the value 6.47. The van der Waals force
is weaker than the covalent binding forces by a factor of 1000. But it is
responsible for the formation of crystals of the noble gases and the binding
of large molecules.
The calculation presented here is based on the static Coulomb potential.
In fact, the electric interaction occurs via the exchange of photons, and thus it
is not instantaneous but propagates with the speed of light c. The propagation
time of the light is τlight = 2R/c, and the characteristic time for one revolution
of the electron in the atom is τ = 1/me4 . For small distances,

If the Hamiltonian has, in addition to a time independent part H0 , a time
dependent part V (t),
H(t) = H0 + V (t)

,

(16.2)

we can either try to solve the Schrödinger equation
i

∂
|ψ, t = H(t)|ψ, t

(16.3)

or else the Heisenberg equations to be discussed shortly. The solution of the
Schrödinger equation (16.3) can be represented formally by
|ψ, t = U (t, t0 )|ψ, t0

.

(16.4)

The quantity U (t, t0 ) expresses the time development of an arbitrary initial
state |ψ, t0 . Substitution into the Schrödinger equation gives the following
equation determining U (t, t0 ):
i

U (t, t0 ) = H(t)U (t, t0 )

(16.5)

which is to be solved subject to the initial condition
U (t0 , t0 ) = 1 .

(16.6)

For time independent H, we ﬁnd immediately
i
U (t, t0 ) = exp − H(t − t0 )

a result which is known from Sect. 8.5 and is equivalent to (16.1). For inﬁnitesimal time diﬀerences, the Schrödinger equation implies


|ψ, t + dt = 1 − H(t)dt |ψ, t
(16.7)

and thus generally
U (t + dt, t) = 1 −

i
H(t) dt .

(16.8)

We can now represent U (t, t0 ) as a product of inﬁnitesimal time development
operators (16.8):
U (t, t0 ) = exp

,
(16.9)

where the time interval (t−t0 ) is decomposed into n inﬁnitesimal subintervals
Δ = (t − t0 )/n, n → ∞. From (16.9), one immediately sees that U (t, t0 ) is
unitary:
U (t, t0 )† U (t, t0 ) = U (t, t0 )U (t, t0 )† = 1 .

(16.10)

We now deﬁne the Heisenberg operator OH (t) corresponding to the Schrödinger operator O by
OH (t) = U (t, t0 )† O U (t, t0 ) .

(16.11)

Since U (t, t0 ) satisﬁes the same diﬀerential equation as exp {−iHt/} in the
time independent case, just as in Sect. 8.5 the equation of motion (Heisenberg
equation) follows:
d

OH (t) = [HH (t), OH (t)] + OH (t) .

(16.12)

The last term in (16.12) arises only for operators
OH (t) = O(xH (t), pH (t), S H (t), . . . ; t)

(16.13)

depending explicitly on time (last argument in (16.13)). The Heisenberg state
is deﬁned by
|ψ H = U (t, t0 )† |ψ, t

.

(16.14)

Thus, |ψ H = |ψ, t0 and is therefore independent of the time:
d
|ψ H = 0 .

(16.15)

Just as in (8.59), the matrix elements of operators are given by
ψ, t|O|ϕ, t = ψ|H OH (t)|ϕ H

where T is the time-ordering operator, which orders subsequent factors from right
to left consecutively in time, e.g.:
´
`
T H(t1 )H(t2 ) = Θ(t1 − t2 )H(t1 )H(t2 ) + Θ(t2 − t1 )H(t2 )H(t1 ) .
Then (16.9) may be rewritten as

.
´ `
´
`
Here we have used the fact that the operators H t0 +Δ(n−1) , H t0 +Δ(n−2) , . . .
can be treated as commuting within a time ordered product and that for commuting
operators eA eB = eA+B . Thus, in the limit Δ → 0 one obtains (16.9 ).

For time dependent H(t), the solution of the Schrödinger equation or
of the Heisenberg equations is only possible in special cases, e.g., for harmonic oscillators or low-dimensional systems such as the motion of a spin of
magnitude 1/2 in a magnetic ﬁeld. As a rule, however, one is forced to use
approximation methods.

16.2 The Sudden Approximation
As an illustration of the domain of applicability of this approximation
method, we give the following example: An atomic nucleus emits an αparticle. The electrons must adjust to the new nuclear charge, which is two
units smaller. Here, the characteristic time for the restructuring of the electronic cloud is much larger than the duration of the α-decay. Thus, the electrons still ﬁnd themselves immediately after the decay in the same state as
before it. For example, the question arises as to the probability that the
electrons will be in the ground state afterwards. The general problem can be
posed as follows: Let the Hamiltonian (16.2) for t ≤ 0 be independent of time,
H = H0 . Suppose it is changed within the “switching time” τs to H = H0 +V
and that it thereafter remains time independent (Fig. 16.1). Suppose that τs
is much shorter than the characteristic time τch for the restructuring of the
system, i.e., τs  τch . In this sense, the change is “sudden”. How large for
example is the probability that afterwards the system is in an excited state
of the new Hamiltonian if it was originally in the ground state?
Let the (original) stationary states of H0 be
0

|n0 , t = e−iEn t/ |n0

,

292

16. Time Dependent Phenomena

Fig. 16.1. Sudden change of the time dependent
part of the Hamiltonian (16.2)

and the stationary states of H0 + V (afterwards) be
|n, t = e−iE n t/ |n

.

If the system was in the state |ψ, t before the change, then by the assumption
τs  τch , it remains in this state just after the change. The further time
development satisﬁes

|ψ, t =
e−iE n t/ |n n|ψ, 0 .
(16.17)
n

The probability that a transition from |ψ to |n takes place is
Pψ → n = | n|ψ, 0 |2

.

(16.18)

The sudden approximation is only applicable for transitions between discrete
states. In transitions into the continuum, the condition τs  τch is not fulﬁlled.

16.3 Time Dependent Perturbation Theory
16.3.1 Perturbative Expansion
We now suppose that the time dependent part V (t) in the Hamiltonian (16.2)
is small compared to H0 and can be regarded as a perturbation. Suppose also
that V (t) = 0 for times t ≤ t0 .
For t ≤ t0 , let the system be in the state |ψ 0 , t satisfying the Schrödinger
equation
i

∂ 0
|ψ , t = H0 |ψ 0 , t
∂t

.

(16.19)

After the perturbation has been switched on, the state evolves into |ψ, t ,
which must satisfy the new Schrödinger equation
i

∂
|ψ, t = [H0 + V (t)]|ψ, t
∂t

(16.20)

16.3 Time Dependent Perturbation Theory

293

and the initial condition
|ψ, t = |ψ 0 , t for t ≤ t0

.

(16.21)

For the systematic development of perturbation theory, it is convenient to
separate oﬀ that part of the time evolution which occurs due to H0 and which
is supposed to be known from the outset. For this purpose, we transform
to the interaction picture (also called the Dirac picture). The states in the
interaction picture |ψ, t I are deﬁned by (Sect. 8.5.3)
|ψ, t I = eiH0 t/ |ψ, t

.

(16.22)

The equations of motion in the interaction picture are obtained by diﬀerentiating (16.22) with respect to time and using the Schrödinger equation (16.20):
i

∂
|ψ, t I = −H0 |ψ, t I + eiH0 t/ [H0 + V (t)]|ψ, t
∂t

i

∂
|ψ, t I = VI (t)|ψ, t I
∂t

,

or
.

(16.23)

Here, the perturbation operator in the interaction picture is deﬁned by
VI (t) = eiH0 t/ V (t)e−iH0 t/

.

(16.24)

Instead of (16.20), we can solve the Schrödinger equation in the interaction picture (16.23). The time integration yields
|ψ, t I = |ψ, t0 I +

1
i

 t

dt VI (t )|ψ, t I

(16.25)

an integral equation which gives by means of iterative substitution the following series expansion in VI (t):

(16.26)

This expansion is known as the Neumann series. In principle, it allows one
to calculate the state up to arbitrary order in the perturbation, provided the
assumptions of perturbation theory are satisﬁed. We will restrict ourselves
here to those applications in which the series can be truncated after the ﬁrst
term.

16. Time Dependent Phenomena

16.3.2 First-Order Transitions
Let the system be initially in the eigenstate
|m, t = e−iH0 t/ |m = e−iEm t/ |m
of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 . We seek the probability of ﬁnding the
system at the time t in the state
|n, t = e−iH0 t/ |n = e−iEn t/ |n
after the action of V (t). The probability amplitude for this transition is
n, t|ψ, t = n|eiH0 t/ |ψ, t = n|ψ, t I

.

(16.27)

Substituting the initial state
|ψ 0 , t I = eiH0 t/ |m, t = |m
into (16.26), we ﬁnd to ﬁrst order in VI (t)

1 t 

16.3.3 Transitions into a Continuous Spectrum, the Golden Rule
We now apply (16.30) to transitions into a continuous spectrum of ﬁnal states.
Examples of this are:
(a) Scattering: Here, the momentum k of a particle goes over to k . Firstorder perturbation theory leads to the Born approximation of scattering
theory.
(b) α-decay: Here as well, the ﬁnal states, i.e., the momenta of the αparticles, lie in a continuum.
(c) Optical transitions: An excited state makes a transition to a lower state
by emitting a photon, whose momentum varies continuously.

16.3 Time Dependent Perturbation Theory

295

Fig. 16.2. The function δt (α)

We will take up these concrete examples again later, but for now let us
formulate the general theory of such transitions.
We consider ﬁrst a perturbation that is switched on at the time t = 0 and
subsequently remains unchanged:
V (t) = V Θ(t)

.

(16.31)

We cannot utilize the sudden approximation here, since transitions to states
within a continuum occur in an arbitrarily short time.

(16.34d)

For long times, we thus obtain from (16.32)
2π
δ(En − Em )| n|V |m |2 .
(16.35)

From this, one obtains the transition rate, that is, the transition probability
per unit time,
2π
δ(En − Em )| n|V |m |2 .
(16.36)
Γmn =

Since we are treating transitions into states of a continuous spectrum, the
transition rate to a group of states is of interest; in scattering, for example, to
all of the states with wave numbers in a certain angular region. We suppose
that the matrix element for all of these ﬁnal states is equal and introduce the
density of states (En ). The quantity (En )dEn gives the number of states
in the interval dEn . The transition rate into this set of states is then


2π
Γmn = dEn (En )Γmn = (Em ) | n|V |m |2 .
(16.37)

n
Pmn (t) = t

The energy of the ﬁnal state |n entering the matrix element of (16.37) must
be equal to Em .
The formulae (16.36, 16.37) and their analogs for periodically varying
potentials V (t) were derived by Pauli in 1928, and, because of the multitude
of applications, Fermi coined the phrase “golden rule”1 .
We now add a few remarks concerning the validity of the golden rule.
For this, we must go back to our original representation of the δ-function
δt [(En − Em )/2] in (16.34a). For every ﬁnite t, the width of this function is
4π/t. In order for this function to be replaceable by a δ-function, the width
of the energy distribution of the ﬁnal states ΔE must be much larger than
2π/t (Fig. 16.3). The second condition is that many states must lie within
this δ-like function, because only then can we characterize this set of states
by a density of states. Denoting the separation of the energy levels by δε, we
thus have the condition

16.3.4 Periodic Perturbations
We now extend the golden rule to the case where the perturbation which has
been switched on at t = 0 varies periodically with time. This can occur for
example in the case of a periodic external electric ﬁeld. In general,
V (t) = Θ(t)(F e−iωt + F † eiωt )

,

(16.38)

where F is an operator. For the coupling to the electromagnetic ﬁeld, which
will be treated later, V is given in (16.43). The transition matrix element is
then (Fig. 16.4)

For the free radiation ﬁeld, we use the transverse gauge div A = 0, also
designated the Coulomb gauge. It then follows, because of the absence of
sources, that Φ = 0 and
1
(16.47a)
E = − Ȧ , B = ∇ × A .

Because of the absence of external currents, A satisﬁes the free wave equation.
We can now expand the radiation ﬁeld in a Fourier series

A(x, t) =
Ak (t)eik · x .
(16.47b)
k

The individual oscillation amplitudes Ak (t) will be decomposed as in (16.46b)
into sums of annihilation and creation operators. For this, it remains only to
ﬁnd out what to insert for m and ω. We can read oﬀ this information from
the energy of the radiation ﬁeld, which is given by

(16.50)

Then, a†k,λ (ak,λ ) creates (annihilates) a quantum of wave number k and polarization λ. Substituting the expansion (16.49) of A(x, t) into (16.48), one

The sum of the zero point energies in (16.51a) diverges. In quantum ﬁeld theory the products in (16.48) are deﬁned in normal ordered form, i.e. all creation
operators are placed to the left of the annihilation operators. Then the Hamiltonian (16.51a) no longer contains any zero point energies, while otherwise remaining unchanged (see F. Schwabl, Advanced Quantum Mechanics, 3rd ed., Springer,
Berlin, Heidelberg 2005).

16.4 Interaction with the Radiation Field

301

The total Hamiltonian of matter coupled to the quantized radiation ﬁeld
reads
H = H0 + Hrad + H1

.

(16.51b)

Here H0 and Hrad are the Hamiltonians of the electrons and of the free

picture, A(x) is to be replaced by A(x, t) of (16.49), and ((x), j(x)) by
eiH0 t/ ((x), j(x)) e−iH0 t/ .
The ﬁrst term of the interaction Hamiltonian (16.51c) gives rise to processes in which one photon is annihilated or created. The second term leads
to the annihilation (creation) of two photons and also to the simultaneous
annihilation and creation of a photon.
16.4.3 Spontaneous Emission
We now consider the spontaneous emission of a photon by an atom; an atomic
electron makes a transition from its initial state |m to the state |n and
emits a photon of wave number k and polarization λ. Let the radiation ﬁeld
be initially in the ground state – also known as the vacuum state – which we
denote by |0 . The initial state of the complete system is then |0 |m , and its
ﬁnal state is a†k,λ |0 |n . The perturbative operator inducing the transition is
given by the ﬁrst term in (16.45) (or (16.51c)), where we substitute (16.49);
it is of the form (16.38). Because of ak ,λ |0 = 0 and the oscillator (Bose)
commutation relations, only the second term contributes in the golden rule
for the transition rate (16.40):

From this we can determine the power dPλ radiated into the solid angle

Because of energy conservation, implied by the δ-function in (16.54), the
frequency is ω = (Em − En )/, and the wave number k in the matrix element
is restricted to |k| = ω/c.
Remarks: Before evaluating this quantum mechanical formula, we would like to
gain an overview of the orders of magnitude occurring in it. The energy of a photon
emitted in atomic transitions is ω ∼ mc2 (Zα)2 ∼ (Ze)2 /a, and therefore the
wavelength is λ̄ = λ/(2π) = c/ω ≈ a/(Z 2 α), where a is the Bohr radius, α the
ﬁne-structure constant (see Sect. 6.3), and τ ≈ 2πa/Zv ≈ 2πa/(Z 2 α c) ≃ 2π/ω
the classical period. In order to determine the lifetime ΔT or the duration of the
optical transition, we take from classical electrodynamics the power emitted by an
accelerated charge e in all spatial directions:

P = dP = 3 ẍ2 .

In order of magnitude, the power must also be equal to the ratio of ω to ΔT , i.e.,
P ≈ ω/ΔT , and therefore
1 −1 −3
ω α
∼ ω −1 α−3 .
(16.56)
Z2
With this, we can also estimate the coherence length of the emitted light wave
ΔL = c ΔT . For visible light, 1/λ = 1.3 × 104 − 2.8 × 104 cm−1 , i.e., ω ≈ 1015 Hz,
and therefore ΔT ≈ 10−9 s. This corresponds to a coherent wave train of length
ΔL ≈ 10 – 20 cm.
ΔT ≈

We now return to the expression (16.55) for the power radiated per unit
solid angle in the direction of k. Since for atoms
k · x ≈ ka = a/λ̄ ≈ α  1 ,
we may expand the exponential function of (16.53):

n|j k |m = n| d3 x (1 − ik · x + 12 (ik · x)2 + . . . )j(x)|m


The radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the frequency

is proportional to the projection of dnm onto ε∗k,λ , and the intensity is proportional to its square. The matrix element ednm of the dipole operator eX
determines which electric dipole transitions are possible.
16.4.5 Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions
Statements concerning vanishing or possibly nonvanishing matrix elements
dnm are called selection rules. In order to derive them, we begin with

is the total angular momentum and X, Y, and Z are the components of the
center of mass deﬁned above. We assume that the initial (ﬁnal) states are
eigenstates of L2 and Lz with quantum numbers l(l ) and m(m ). It then
follows from (16.66a,b) that
l , m |Z|l, m (m − m) = 0 ,
l , m |(X + iY )|l, m (m − m − 1) = 0

(16.68b)

(16.68c)

Electric dipole transitions are only possible if one of the dipole matrix elements is ﬁnite, that is, according to (16.68a–c), if one of the selection rules

m

m =
(16.69)

is satisﬁed.
By means of the commutator
[L2 , [L2 , X]] = 22 {X, L2 }
one can show in complete analogy that
l , m |X|l, m (l + l )(l + l + 2)[(l − l )2 − 1] = 0 .
The last factor yields the selection rule
l = l ± 1 .

(16.70)

Since l and l are both nonnegative, the third factor cannot vanish, and the
second can only vanish for l = l = 0. However, this selection rule cannot be
satisﬁed, since the states with l = l = 0 are independent of direction, and
therefore these matrix elements of X vanish. Formally, one easily shows this
using the parity operator P (see (5.35)),
0|X|0 = 0|P XP |0 = − 0|XP 2 |0 = − 0|X|0

,

that is, 0|X|0 = 0.
We now discuss the polarization of the emitted light. For transitions with
m unchanged, m = m, (16.68) yields dmn ∼ ez . For such transitions, the
emitted light is linearly polarized according to (16.65) in the k − ez -plane
(see Fig. 16.5a). There is no radiation in the z-direction.
For electric dipole transitions with m = m ± 1, the matrix elements of
X ± iY are ﬁnite, and, by (16.68b,c),
l , m |(X ∓ iY )|l, m = 0 , i.e., l , m |Y |l, m = ∓ i l , m |X|l, m

(16.71)

If the wave vector k of the emitted photon points in the z-direction, then
by εr(l) = ε1 ∓ iε2 it is right (left) circularly polarized, and its helicity is
negative (positive), corresponding to spin − (+) in the direction of k, which
it must carry oﬀ because of the conservation of the z-component of angular
momentum. On the other hand, light emitted in the “equatorial” xy-plane
is linearly polarized. For all other k-directions it is elliptically polarized (see
Fig. 16.5b).

Fig. 16.5a,b. Polarization for electric dipole transitions

The selection rules considerably restrict the optical transitions. For example, an H atom cannot make a direct transition from one of the Rydberg
states with large principal quantum number n into the ground state if in
addition l = n − 1, but only stepwise by means of dipole transitions from one
level to the next. The same thing happens in the capture of muons, which
ﬁrst enter a highly excited state, i.e., l ≈ n (see Fig. 16.6).

16.4.6 The Lifetime for Electric Dipole Transitions
We are now in a position to compute the transition probability per unit time
and determine the lifetime of an excited state. The transition probability per
unit time with a photon emitted into the solid angle dΩ is given by

Γm→n,k,λ .
(16.72)

In comparison with the radiated power of Eq. (16.54) the factor ck is absent.

16.4.7 Electric Quadrupole and Magnetic Dipole Transitions
The electric quadrupole transitions (E2) and the magnetic dipole transitions
(M 1) result from the second term in (16.58) for the expansion of the current
density. We ﬁrst symmetrize with respect to the wave number and polarization

(k × ε∗k,λ ) · L
−i 2 d3 x(k × ε∗k,λ )(x × j(x)) = −

.

(16.78)

Because of the proportionality to the orbital angular momentum and thus to
the orbital part of the magnetic moment operator, the resulting transitions
are called magnetic dipole transitions (M 1). The matrix element
1  
l , m |(k × ε∗k,λ ) · L|l, m

is only diﬀerent from zero if the selection rules

(16.79)

for magnetic dipole transitions are fulﬁlled. The former follows from the
known properties of the angular momentum, and the latter follows from
[L2 , L] = 0. For the second term in (16.77), one ﬁnds using (16.44b)5

The index i again labels the electrons. Einstein’s summation convention is used
for the indices j and l, which label the Cartesian vector components.



Here, xl xj is the quadrupole moment operator. From (16.58), because of the
additional factor k · x, it is evident that the amplitudes of the M 1 and E2
transitions are smaller than those of the E1 transitions by ka ≈ α = 1/137.
Of course, one also sees this immediately from the matrix elements. The
higher-multipole transitions, corresponding to the term of higher order in
k · x ∼ α in (16.58), are even weaker and are thus only noticeable if the
lower-order transitions are forbidden due to selection rules.
Since the perturbation Hamiltonian in the form (16.45) or (16.51c) does
not contain the spin of the electrons, the transitions discussed up till now
conserve the spin, i.e., they satisfy the additional selection rule
ΔS = S  − S = 0

.

(16.82)

According to our discussion in Chap. 5, however, there is also a coupling of
the radiation ﬁeld to the spin. By (9.28) and (9.25), we have for this the
additional perturbation operator

where we use A(x, t) in the representation (16.49). As one sees, this also
leads to a matrix element smaller than the matrix element of the electric
dipole transition by a factor of k/p ≈ ka ≈ α. For the spin-dependent
dipole transitions, the selection rule (16.82) no longer holds. One might think
that (16.83) would give a transition for He from the triplet state 1s2s 3 S1
into the singlet state 1s2 1 S0 . However, the spatial part of the matrix element

is zero, since |100 |100 and i exp {ik ·xi } are symmetric and (|100 |2lm −
|2lm |100 ) is antisymmetric.
16.4.8 Absorption and Induced Emission
As our ﬁnal example of the interaction of atomic electrons with the radiation
ﬁeld, we brieﬂy study the absorption of photons and induced emission.
Let us ﬁrst consider the absorption of a photon with wave number and
polarization (k, λ). We assume that in the initial state there are just nk,λ
photons of the kind (k, λ) present. Then the ﬁnal state consists of nk,λ − 1
such photons. Let the initial state of the atom be |n and the ﬁnal (higher)
state |m : The process described results from the ﬁrst term in (16.51c) and
the annihilation operator contained therein. The transition amplitude is given
by the matrix element

(16.85)

in full analogy to (16.52). The absorption rate increases linearly with the
number of incident photons.
Next we discuss the emission process. Now the initial state of the atom
is |m and the ﬁnal state is |n . Again there are nk,λ photons incident on
the atom, but the ﬁnal state contains nk,λ + 1 such photons. The relevant
matrix element now comes from the creation operator contained in the ﬁrst
term of (16.51c)

2π(nk,λ + 1)

δ(En + ck − Em )| n|ε∗k,λ · j k |m |2 . (16.87)

First we note that the dependence on the atomic matrix elements is the same
in (16.85) and (16.87)
| n|ε∗k,λ · j k |m |2 = | m|εk,λ · j −k |n |2

.

If there are no photons present initially, i.e. nk,λ = 0, the emission rate (16.87)
reduces to the rate for spontaneous emission (16.52) evaluated in Sect. 16.4.3.

310

16. Time Dependent Phenomena

emiss
The nk,λ -dependent contribution to Γm
→ n is the rate of induced (or stimulated) emission and is equal in magnitude to the absorption rate Γnabs
→ m.
This equality is referred to as detailed balancing. In the quantum ﬁeld theoretic description of the radiation ﬁeld developed in this section, spontaneous
emission and induced emission are just facets of one and the same theoretical
treatment.

Equations (16.85), (16.87) are the basis for the relation between the famous
“A and B coeﬃcients” of Einstein. Suppose that the atomic levels En and Em are
thermally populated according to the Boltzmann factors e−En /kT and e−Em /kT ,
respectively. Then the condition that the emission (gain) and absorption (loss)
processes balance each other leads to the Planck radiation law (1.2) for black-body
radiation at temperature T .

We now attempt to ﬁnd a recursion relation for the solutions. If χl is a
solution of the diﬀerential equation (17.8), what is the equation satisﬁed by
χ = (1/)χl ?
To this end, we diﬀerentiate the diﬀerential equation (17.8) once, giving

17. The Central Potential II

17.4 The Limiting Case of a Deep Potential Well

The right-hand side of this equation does not depend on V0 . Thus, for V0 
|E|, the factor multiplying q must be close to zero, i.e., cot (qa − lπ/2) ≈ 0,
in order that in the limit V0 → ∞ the term q cot (qa − lπ/2) remain ﬁnite.
Hence, for this limiting case,
qa −

.

(17.27)

For large q, or |E|  V0 , we can expand q, in (17.20), in terms of E. If we

One sees immediately that in this limit the states with equal n + l/2 are
degenerate. Formula (17.28) holds only for large n, since only then is the
assumption qa  l satisﬁed. However, in order to obtain a rough overview,
we can calculate (17.28) even for small n, as is summarized in Table 17.1.
From this, the following order of the energy levels would result: 1S; 1P ; 1D,
2S; 1F , 2P ; 1G, 2D, 3S; . . . . Degenerate eigenvalues are separated only by

i.e., the wave function vanishes at the inﬁnitely high barrier. The permissible
values of qa and thus the energy eigenvalues (q)2 /2m are obtained from the
zeros of the Bessel functions. These are known, and we list the lowest ones
in Table 17.2. The quantity N labels the sequence of zeros; it also gives the
number of nodes for this wave number and corresponds to the radial quantum
number of the Coulomb wave functions.

Atomic nuclei consist of nucleons, that is, protons and neutrons. In the shell
model of nuclear structure, one assumes that every nucleon moves in a short
range, rotationally symmetric potential generated by the other nucleons. Let
us assume as the simplest model a spin independent, deep potential well.
Since nucleons are fermions, the occupation number of every energy level can
reach 2 × (2l + 1). A shell for protons (neutrons) is ﬁlled on the basis of the
sequence of energy levels found in Table 17.1 for proton (neutron) number 2,
8 (= 2 + 2 × 3), 18 (= 2 + 2 × 3 + 2 × 5), 20 (= 18 + 2), 34 (= 20 + 2 × 7),
40, 58, 68, 90, 106. These numbers are called “magic numbers”. Nuclei with
magic proton number and neutron number N are called doubly magic nuclei.

320

17. The Central Potential II

These are especially stable. In comparison to their neighboring nuclei, they
have an anomalously small tendency to bind a further nucleon, and their
excited states lie anomalously high.
In nature, things are of course more complicated due to the eﬀective spin–
orbit interaction of the nucleons. The levels are shifted for this reason and
the true magic numbers are1

From (17.37) one obtains the phase shift as a function of energy and potential
strength. The sign of the phase shift can be understood even without computation by physical considerations. For negative potential, the wave number
inside of the potential is raised and the wave function in the exterior region is
pulled in, i.e., δ0 > 0. For a repulsive potential, the wave number is decreased
in the interior, and the wave function is pushed out in comparison with the
force-free wave function. This is shown in Fig. 17.3 for s-waves.

18. Scattering Theory

To gain information about the structure of matter, ranging from elementary
particles to solids, one studies the scattering of particles (electrons, neutrons,
He atoms, photons) (Fig. 18.1).
The particle incident on the target will be represented by a wave packet.
This must be large compared to the dimensions of the scatterer, but small
compared to the remaining spatial dimensions, in order not to overlap simultaneously with the scatterer and the detector. Its width in momentum space
must be suﬃciently narrow, so that the spreading during the experiment is
negligible, Eq. (2.108). After the interaction, the wave function consists of an
unscattered part propagating in the forward direction as well as a scattered
part. In what follows, we consider a single scattering center described by a
potential V (x), which is taken to be situated at the origin of coordinates.

the velocity v = k0 /m towards the target. We seek the wave function ψ(x, t)
for later times, in particular, after the interaction with the scattering center.

Here, we have introduced new expansion coeﬃcients Ak , which we will determine later. In expansion (18.3), only states corresponding to a wave incident
from the left and an outgoing scattered wave appear. No bound states occur,
since these fall oﬀ exponentially.

18.1.2 Formal Solution
of the Time Independent Schrödinger Equation
We must now determine the general structure of the stationary states ψk (x).
To this end, we add and subtract terms in (18.2b) in such a way as to interchange the second term on the left-hand side and the term on the right-hand
side. We then are confronted with a wave equation with an inhomogeneity
(source term) dependent on ψk (x):

In order to obtain a formal solution, or, more precisely, in order to transform
to an integral equation, we make use of the retarded Green’s function G+ (x)
of the free Schrödinger equation (wave equation, see also Appendix A.3)
(∇2 + k 2 )G+ (x) = δ (3) (x) ,
and hence obtain from (18.2b )

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is a solution of the free Schrödinger

The expression after the ﬁrst equality is veriﬁed by applying the operator
(∇2 + k 2 ) to (18.5) or by Fourier transformation of (18.5). The poles of the
integrand lie in the complex q-plane at q = ± k. The path of integration
is shown in Fig. 18.2. Since r > 0, one can close the path in the upper
half-plane. As discussed in more detail in Appendix A.3, the path along the
real q-axis in Fig. 18.2 is chosen in such a way that, in accordance with the
physical situation, an outgoing spherical wave results. Indeed, by means of
the residue theorem, we immediately obtain

18.1.3 Asymptotic Behavior of the Wave Packet
We can now continue with the calculation of the time evolution of the wave
packet (18.4). We ﬁrst determine the coeﬃcients Ak entering the expansion (18.3) of the wave packet in terms of the exact eigenfunctions ψk (x)
of the scatterer. For this, we express exp {ik · x} in (18.1) in terms of the

where k̂0 = k0 /k0 .

(18.15)

is identical to the wave packet which would result at time t in the absence of
the scatterer. Recall Eq. (2.105). Again using the above approximate expression for k ≈ k0 · k, the second term in (18.14) can be rearranged , so that
using fk (ϑ, ϕ) ≈ fk0 (ϑ, ϕ) we gain altogether
ψ(x, t) = ψ0 (x, t) +

fk0 (ϑ, ϕ)
ψ0 (k̂0 r, t) .
r

(18.16)

In the radial direction, ψ0 (k̂0 r, t) has the the same shape as the incident wave
packet. The wave function after the scattering is a linear superposition of the
transmitted wave packet and the scattered wave, deﬂected to all solid angles
according to fk0 (ϑ, ϕ)/r (Fig. 18.1). Equation (18.16) does not hold in the
following circumstances
(a) if narrow scattering resonances are present, causing a strong deformation
of the wave packet (see Sect. 3.7);
(b) for the long-range Coulomb potential, for which a diﬀerent r-dependence
results (see Sect. 18.11.2).

18.3 Partial Waves
We now suppose that the potential V (x) = v(r) is spherically symmetric. To
start with, the formal scattering solution ψk (x) of (18.9) will be expanded
in spherical harmonics. Our goal in this section is to investigate stationary
solutions which are also eigenfunctions of the angular momentum (partial
waves). We will characterize the asymptotic behavior of these partial waves
by phase shifts. Comparison of the formal scattering solution (18.28) with the
equivalent expansion in partial waves allows one to represent the scattering
amplitude and the scattering cross section in terms of the phase shifts.
We ﬁrst recall the expansion (17.44) of a plane wave in spherical harmonics,
eik · x =

∞


il (2l + 1)jl (kr)Pl (cos ϑ) ,

(18.26)

l=0

where we assume that the incident plane wave is in the z-direction (Fig. 18.3).
Due to the spherical symmetry of v(r) the scattering is cylindrically symmetric. By rotational invariance about ez , the scattering amplitude (18.10)
and the wave function ψk (x) (18.9) are independent of the azimuthal angle ϕ:
fk (ϑ, ϕ) = fk (ϑ) =

∞


(2l + 1)fl Pl (cos ϑ)

(18.27)

The expansion coeﬃcients fl are called partial wave scattering amplitudes.

Because of the rotational symmetry emphasized above (ϕ-independence),
only Yl0 ∼ Pl (cos ϑ) appears in (18.30). Separating oﬀ (2l + 1) in (18.27)
and (18.30) will simplify later formulas. One refers to (18.30) as the partialwave expansion. We ﬁrst study the individual partial waves for large r. At
distances r, for which v(r) = 0 or at least v(r) < 1/r2 , the radial solution
Rl (r) behaves like

(18.31)
Rl (r) = Bl hl (kr) + Sl (E)hl (kr)

These have the asymptotic behaviour

(2)

and hl

∼ ie−i(kr−lπ) /kr

.

(18.32)

18.3 Partial Waves

333

The ﬁrst term in (18.31) corresponds to an incident spherical wave, the second
to an outgoing spherical wave. The coeﬃcients Bl and Sl (E) have now to be
determined.
According to (18.9) or (18.28), ψk consists of a plane wave and an outgoing spherical wave. The plane wave is, by (18.26), the sum of incident and
outgoing spherical partial waves. The incident partial waves in (18.31) must
coincide with those in (18.28); this ﬁxes the amplitude Bl as
Bl = 12

.

(18.33)

The quantity Sl (E) is an amplitude dependent on k or equivalently on the
energy. (In the framework of general scattering theory, the Sl (E) are eigenvalues of the S-matrix.)
Potential scattering is elastic. Due to the conservation of the probability
density, for each individual partial wave, the radial component of the current
density must satisfy jr = 0. If we imagine a spherical shell of radius r, there
must be as many particles passing through this shell outward as inward,
which implies |Sl (E)| = 1, a property one refers to as unitarity.
Formally, this follows from

Thus, Sl (E) must be of the form

and one

(18.36a)

Expressing Rl in terms of Bessel and Neumann functions, we obtain
Rl (r) = eiδl (jl (kr) cos δl − nl (kr) sin δl ) .

(18.36b)

At large separations, the inﬂuence of the potential is manifest in the phase
shifts δl (E) of the outgoing waves. These must be found by solving the Schrödinger equation (18.29), subject to the boundary condition (rRl (r))|r=0 = 0.
We can now express the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts.
From (18.30), one obtains with the help of (18.36a) and (18.32) the asymptotic expression for the partial wave expansion of ψk (x):
ψk (x) =

range of the potential. Classically, one sees this condition immediately
from the fact that scattering only occurs if the impact parameter d
is smaller than the range of the potential, i.e., d < a and L = pd =
kd. Quantum mechanically, the argument is as follows: For r > a,
acts. For the energy E =
only the centrifugal potential 2 l(l + 1)/2mr2 
2 k 2 /2m, the classical turning radius is rcl = l(l + 1)/k. For r < rcl ,
the wave function falls oﬀ exponentially. If rcl > a, then the particle
“feels” nothing 
from the potential. The particle is thus only scattered
for rcl ≤ a, i.e., l(l + 1) ≈ l ≤ ka.

The interference of the scattered wave with the transmitted wave ψ0 (x, t)
leads to a decrease of the current in the forward direction. This interference
term is proportional to Im fk0 (0). Since this decrease just gives the total
scattering cross section, the optical theorem again follows, valid also for nonspherical potentials.

If the potential is weak and the eﬀect on Rl is small, then Rl ≈ jl (kr), and
δl is small (see (18.36b)). It is then possible to expand (18.37) in δl , i.e.,
δl ≈ kfl , and from the preceding equation one obtains

This is the Born approximation for the partial wave l.
The Born approximation is good for large l. Classically, large l implies
a large impact parameter l = dp = dk, or that the particle is incident
far from the scatterer and hardly inﬂuenced. See remark (ii) at the end of
Sect. 18.3.
If the inﬂuence of the potential on all partial waves is small, one can
replace the wave function ψk (x) in the integral representation for fk (ϑ, ϕ)
(18.10) directly by exp {ik · x}. An important form of the Born approximation

In the limit μ → 0 this reduces to scattering from a Coulomb potential . Although here the partial wave expansion must be modiﬁed, as we will sketch
at the end of this chapter, and although the conditions for the Born approximation are not satisﬁed, remarkably (18.51a) still gives the exact scattering

(18.51b)

The classical computation also gives the exact result. This circumstance,
which is related to the homogeneity of the Coulomb potential and the scattering cross section as a function of the momentum transfer, was quite conducive to the correct interpretation of experiments in the initial phase of
atomic theory.
We now give an estimate of the validity of the Born approximation: For
short-range potentials, the wave function ψk (x) only enters the scattered
wave of (18.8) at small distances. We therefore calculate ψk (x) for small x
in the Born approximation and set x = 0 in the second term of (18.8):

18.6 Inelastic Scattering
In (18.35), it followed from the conservation of particle ﬂux that |Sl (E)| = 1.
However, if absorption processes take place, in which the scatterer is excited
or particles are annihilated and/or generated, then
Sl (E) = sl (E)e2iδl (E) with 0 ≤ sl (E) ≤ 1 .

(18.52)

where a is the extension of the scattering object (see computation preceding (18.100), where the sum is replaced by an integral). There is also
elastic scattering! (Although Sl = 0, one also has fl = i/2k.) The physical reason is the shadow scattering , which we will later discuss in the
context of high-energy elastic scattering.
(ii) Examples of inelastic processes are inelastic scattering, absorption processes, particle capture, and particle decay processes. The latter reactions can only be treated in quantum ﬁeld theory. The eﬀect on the
elastic scattering amplitude can be simulated phenomenologically in the
Schrödinger equation by means of a complex potential. The potential
V (x) = V1 (x) + iV2 (x) leads to the absorption of particles. Here, the

18.7 Scattering Phase Shifts
Next, we compute the phase shifts in order to derive important properties of
the scattering cross section. We assume a short range potential which vanishes
for r > a. The following conclusions are valid even if, at large distances, only
the weaker assumption v(r) < r−2 is satisﬁed.
For r > a, the partial wave takes the form
Rl> (r) = 12 [h∗l (kr) + e2iδl hl (kr)]

(1)

, hl ≡ hl

.

(18.59)

For r < a, we designate the partial wave by Rl< (r), which may be found
analytically or determined numerically. In the following, only the logarithmic

.

As an example, we consider the scattering from a hard sphere of radius a,
which is used as a model for low-energy nuclear scattering experiments. One
then has Rl (a) = 0 and αl = ∞. Here, (18.62 ) takes the form
cot δl =

nl (ka)
jl (ka)

.

(18.63)

From this and (17.12), the phase shift of the s-waves then becomes
δ0 = −ka .

(18.64)

For a repulsive potential, the phase shift is negative.
Behavior of δl for small k (i.e., small energy)
The expansion of (18.62 ) for small k gives, with the aid of (17.13),
tan δl (k) =

l − aαl
(2l + 1)
(ka)2l+1
[(2l + 1)!!]2
l + 1 + aαl

.

(18.65)

For ka → 0 the wave number dependence of the scattering phase shift becomes
δl ∼ k 2l+1

.

(18.66)

For suﬃciently small energy, the partial waves with l ≥ 1 therefore do not
contribute. One then has pure s-wave scattering:

and σ = 4π

sin2 δ0

.

(18.67)

For low-energy scattering from a hard sphere, (18.67) and (18.64) yield in
the limit as k approaches zero
σ = 4πa2 = 4 × (classical scattering cross section)

.

(18.68)

For suﬃciently small energy, the scattering is purely isotropic. Compare remark (ii) at the end of Sect. 18.3.

342

18. Scattering Theory

We now show that exp {2iδl } − 1 has poles at the energies of the bound
(1)
states. For a bound state with angular momentum l, (17.21b) and hl ≡ hl ,
the wave function outside the potential is
Rl> (r) = hl (iκr) with Eb = −

The logarithmic derivative is then given by

Substituting this expression into (18.61), one sees that exp {2iδl } − 1 has a
simple pole at k = iκ.

18.8 Resonance Scattering from a Potential Well
For a spherical potential well of radius a and depth V0 (Fig. 18.4), i.e.,
v(r) = −V0 Θ(a − r)

,

We return now to (18.64) for the phase shift δl in the limit of low energy,
i.e. small k. If the resonance condition
l + 1 + aαl (E) = 0

(18.73)

is satisﬁed, then δl (k) = (n + 1/2)π, and the partial-wave scattering cross
section takes its maximum value
σl (k) =

4π(2l + 1)

(resonance scattering). Since for other k-values the phase shifts δl ∼ (ka)2l+1 ,
these resonances become very sharp for large l.
Now, we investigate resonance scattering in detail for small energies and
a very deep potential well:
ka  l  qa

.

(18.75)

We can then substitute the asymptotic formula for jl (qa), Eq. (17.14),
into (18.72) and the resonance condition (18.73) to obtain

This condition is equivalent to the equation determining bound states in the
potential well, (17.27). We are dealing here with virtual levels, rather than
bound states, since E > 0.
Aside from the determination of the position of the resonances, all of the
considerations of this section also hold for other short-range potentials.
We now determine the energy dependence of the phase shift and scattering
cross section near the resonance energy ER . Expanding (18.65), we ﬁnd for
the phase shift
tan δl (k) = −

γ(ka)2l+1
+ O[(ka)2l+1 ] ,
E − ER

(18.77)

where we deﬁne γ = −[(2l − 1)!!]−2 [aαl (ER )]−1 . At resonance, the phase shift
takes the value π/2. One can show generally that γ > 0, see Problem 18.3.
Furthermore, we introduce the abbreviation Γk = 2(ka)2l+1 γ. The partial
scattering cross section then becomes
σl =

(Γk /2)2
4π(2l + 1)
2
k
(E − ER )2 + (Γk /2)2

.

(18.78)

This is the Breit–Wigner formula for resonance scattering (Fig. 18.5).
We can ﬁnd the scattering amplitude most simply by writing (18.37) in
the form
fl (k) =

tan δl
k(1 − i tan δl )

.

(18.79)

Hence, using (18.77), one ﬁnds
fl (k) =

−Γk /2
E − ER + iΓk /2

.

The scattering amplitude has a pole at

√
in the lower half–plane of the second Riemannian sheet (k = E). Because of
the k-dependence of the width, γ(ka)2l+1 , the low-energy resonances for l ≥ 1
are very sharp. For s-waves, the width is proportional to k, and therefore resonances are, if present at all, not as sharp. Whether or not a maximum occurs
for the occurrence of a maximum in
in σ0 depends on α0 (E).
√ The condition
√
σ0 is |∂α0 /∂k 2 | > 1/ 2k for k = 2mER /.
Finally, using (18.62) and (18.41), we give in Figs. 18.6 and 18.7 the wave
number dependence of the phase shift of the lowest partial waves and the

Remark: Very brieﬂy, we introduce here the concept of the Jost function 3 . If
instead of the scattering solutions one considers regular solutions of the radial
Schrödinger equation for which
lim r −l−1 ul (k, r) = 1

,

r→0

then these have the asymptotic behavior
ul (k, r) =

1
[fl (k)eikr − fl (−k)e−ikr ]
2ik

.

(18.83)

The functions fl (k) = fl∗ (−k∗ ) are known as Jost functions. Comparison with
(18.31) shows that the S-matrix element of the lth partial wave (18.35) can be
expressed by
Sl (k) = (−1)l

fl (k)
fl (−k)

.

(18.84)

The zeros and poles of Sl (k) are thus determined by the zeros of√ fl (± k). As a
function of energy, the Riemann surface of Sl (E) always has a E-branch cut
along the positive real axis. Poles on the negative real axis in the ﬁrst (physical)
sheet correspond to bound states (see (18.70)). Furthermore, the poles in the second
sheet occur in pairs located mirror symmetrically above and below the Re E-axis. At
these positions, Sl (E) has zeros in the ﬁrst sheet. Poles in the lower half-plane of the
second sheet lying near the positive real axis correspond to resonances (Fig. 18.8).

tan δ0 (k) =

(k/q) tan (qa) − tan (ka)
= tan (pa − ka) .
1 + (k/q) tan (qa) tan (ka)

(18.87)

In order to rewrite the original identity, we have deﬁned the auxiliary variable
p via tan (pa) = (k/q) tan (qa), and we have used the addition theorem for
the tangent. Hence, the phase shift becomes, as in (17.37),

√
tan (qa) = −q/(2m|E|)1/2 . As V0 gets larger, for ζ ≡ 2mV0 a2 / ≥ π/2,
3π/2, . . . the potential has one, two, . . . bound states.
For the values ζ = (2n+1)π/2, exactly one of the bound states has energy
E = 0. In this case, tan (qa) = ∞, and it is evident from (18.88) that the
phase is δ0 = π/2 mod π.
Every time an additional bound state occurs, the phase passes through
π/2 and increases by π. This is an example of the Levinson theorem:
δ0 (0) = nb π

,

(18.90)

where nb is the number of bound states. For the sake of completeness we note
that if for l = 0 the Jost function obeys f0 (0) = 0, then (18.90) is replaced
by δ0 (0) = (nb + 1/2)π.
The general prof of Levinson’s theorem4 proceeds by evaluating a contour
integral of fl (z)/fl (z) in the complex plane, where fl (z) are the Jost functions
mentioned at the end of Sect. 18.8. The result is

nb π
for l = 0 or l = 0, f0 (0) = 0
(18.91)
δl (0) =
1
(nb + 2 )π for l = 0, f0 (0) = 0.
Starting from (18.89), we can derive the Ramsauer–Townsend eﬀect for
the scattering of electrons from the noble gases Ar, Kr, Xe, which have closed
shells and together with the nucleus provide an attractive short range potential. Substituting the low-energy phase shift (18.89) into the scattering cross
section, we ﬁnd

σ ≈ 4πa

tan (qa)
−1
qa

2
.

(18.92)

When the energy of the incident electrons has the value E ≈ 0.7 eV, the
condition tan (qa)/qa = 1 is fulﬁlled and σ vanishes, and at these small
energies partial waves with l ≥ 1 do not play any role. The phase shift is
δ0 = π for this energy.
We now return to (18.65) to investigate this relation further for very small
energies and to introduce the concept of scattering length. For small energy,
one can expand (18.65):
k cot δ0 (k) = −

1
1
+ r0 k 2
a0
2

.

(18.93)

In this expansion, a0 is called the scattering length and r0 the eﬀective range
of the potential. It can be proven for arbitrary short-range potentials that
the second term in the expansion is ∝ k 2 . From the low-energy expansion
discussed earlier it follows that

and sin2 δ0 = (ka0 )2 + O(k 4 ). The scattering cross section thus becomes
σ = 4πa20 + O(k 2 ) .

(18.94)

The scattering length thus determines the low-energy scattering cross section.
We see that
e2iδ0 − 1 =

2ka0
2i
=
cot δ0 − i
i − ka0

(18.95)

has a pole for k = i/a0 . For positive a0  a, this pole corresponds to a bound
state of energy Eb = −2 κ2 /2m and κ = 1/a0 . Since the bound state is of
the form exp {−κr}/r, its extension is κ−1 . Thus, the scattering length is
about as large as the extension of the bound state. The scattering amplitude
becomes
f0 =

2ka0 1
≈ −a0
i − ka0 2ik

for k  1/a0

.

(18.96)

Finally, we note that, from (18.95), the energy dependence of the scattering
cross section becomes
σ=

2π2 /m
−Eb + E

(18.97)

and that its low-energy behavior is completely determined by the bound state
lying (as we assumed) near the continuum.
We would now like to see how to read oﬀ the scattering length from the
wave function. For the wave function outside the potential, (18.36b),
R0> (r) = eiδ0 [j0 (kr) cos δ0 − n0 (kr) sin δ0 ]
one has in the limit of small k



1
r
−
sin kr + cos kr ∝ 1 −
u> (r) = rR> (r) ∝
ka0
a0

. (18.98)

In the last proportionality, we have used kr  1. We see from (18.98) that
the extrapolation of u> (r) intersects the r-axis at a0 .
In Fig. 18.10, one recognizes that the scattering length is negative for an
attractive potential without a bound state, while the phase shift is positive.
If the potential gets stronger, a0 → −∞ and δ → π/2. As the potential
increases further, one then has a bound state. As long as the binding energy
remains small, the scattering length, which now is positive, is very large.
The phase shift in this regime is negative or equivalently lies between π/2
and π.

For a repulsive potential, the phase shift is negative, while the scattering
length is always positive and comparable to the width of the potential. In
this case, poles do not occur at negative energies.

Hence, it follows for high energies, i.e., ka  1, that

section at high energies is double the classical scattering cross section. The
reason is the diﬀraction of the wave. This can be seen from the diﬀerential

The ﬁrst term is isotropic and corresponds to the classical diﬀerential scattering cross section a2 /4, while the second term is sharply concentrated in
the forward direction and describes diﬀraction eﬀects. Half of the the total
scattering cross section is due to classical reﬂection scattering, the other half
to diﬀraction.
This can also be understood as follows: The wave function ψ = ψin + ψscat
is the sum of the incident and the scattered wave. Immediately behind the
sphere, in the shadow, ψscat must be just equal to ψin in magnitude and opposite in sign. The ﬂux of ψscat is equal to that part of the ﬂux of ψin obscured
by the sphere (Fig. 18.11). The shadow results from the interference of the
scattered wave in the forward direction with the incident wave. This interference must remove precisely as much intensity from the ray propagating in
the forward direction as is reﬂected oﬀ into ﬁnite angles. For large distances,
this additional contribution to the scattering amplitude is concentrated in
the forward direction. Classically, one regards only the part reﬂected oﬀ the
sphere as scattering.

18.11 Additional Remarks
18.11.1 Transformation to the Laboratory Frame
Let us now establish the connection between the results of potential scattering
and the scattering of two particles in the laboratory frame (L) as opposed to
the center-of-mass frame (CM). In the laboratory frame, one of the particles
is at rest prior to the scattering and is bombarded by the other particle.
In the center-of-mass frame, the center of mass of the two particles is at
rest. The former system usually corresponds to the experimental situation
(e.g., scattering of electrons or photons from atoms). The latter system is
immediately accessible to theory, because – to the extent that the interaction
of the two particles can be represented by a potential – scattering in the
center-of-mass frame is identical to potential scattering, provided the mass is
replaced by the reduced mass of the two particles.
The relations between the diﬀerential scattering cross section dσ/dΩ in
the center-of-mass frame and that of the laboratory frame dσ/dΩL and between the deﬂection angles ϑ and ϑL are the kinematical relations familiar
from classical mechanics (Fig. 18.12):

Fig. 18.12. Transformation from the center-of-mass system to the laboratory system: The diﬀerential scattering cross section for the scattering of hard spheres of
equal mass (M2 = M1 ) is isotropic in the center-of-mass system. The angular dependence in the laboratory system follows from the kinematic relations, which for
equal masses reduce to dσ/dΩL = 4 cos ϑL dσ/dΩ and cos ϑL = cos ϑ/2

18. Scattering Theory

18.11.2 The Coulomb Potential
We found in the case of the Coulomb potential that the classical scattering
cross section dσ/dΩ is identical to the scattering cross section in the Born
approximation and, remarkably, also to the exact quantum mechanical result. One additional remark concerning the exact form of the Coulomb wave
functions: For large separation r, we found for the bound states (Z = 1)
Rnl ∼ rn−1 e−κr
instead of
e−κr
r

,

valid for short-range potentials, where
E=−

me40
2 κ2

22 n2

Hence it follows that
n=

and
Rnl ∼

exp {−κr + n log r} = exp

− κr +

me20

2 κ

.

From this, replacing κ by ik, one obtains the scattering states. Because of the
inﬁnite range of the Coulomb potential, the scattering states are not spherical
waves, but contain additionally a phase shift depending logarithmically on r.

their solutions algebraically?
Let the Hamiltonian H 0
H0 = −

it then follows that

H 1 = Q− Q+

One refers to H as the supersymmetric (SUSY) partner of H .
By virtue of
Q+ = (Q− )†

,

(19.10)

we have again represented the Hamiltonian H 0 as an absolute square. However, in the case of potentials which are not harmonic, the commutator of
the operators Q± is a function of x:
[Q− , Q+ ] = −

d ψ0
= H1 − H0
dx ψ0

.

(19.11)

We ﬁrst demonstrate a few identities.
Q− ψ0 = 0

.

(19.12)

Proof:
From (19.9a) and (19.2) it follows that Q+ Q− ψ0 = 0 and ψ0 |Q+ Q− |ψ0 = 0,
and (19.10) implies the vanishing of the norm of Q− |ψ0 and thus of Q− ψ0
itself.
Multiplying (19.9a) and (19.9b) by Q+ and Q− , one further obtains the
relations
, Q− H 0 − H 1 Q− = 0

Q+ H 1 − H 0 Q+ = 0

.

(19.13)

Let a state ψn0 be given with eigenvalue En0 of H 0 :
Q+ Q− ψn0 = En0 ψn0

.

Multiplying by Q− , one ﬁnds
Q− Q+ (Q− ψn0 ) = En0 (Q− ψn0 ) .
Thus, Q− ψn0 is an eigenstate of H 1 with eigenvalue En0 , except for the ground
state ψ00 , by (19.12).
Let ψn1 be an eigenstate of H 1 with eigenvalue En1 ,
Q− Q+ ψn1 = En1 ψn1

.

19.1 Generalized Ladder Operators

357

Multiplication by Q+ yields
Q+ Q− (Q+ ψn1 ) = En1 (Q+ ψn1 ) .
Hence, Q+ ψn1 is an eigenfunction of H 0 with eigenvalue En1 .
The spectra of the two Hamiltonians can be derived from each other (see
Fig. 19.1). This is especially useful if one of the problems is exactly solvable or
can be treated more easily than the other by controlled approximations (that
is, approximations whose accuracy can be veriﬁed by independent means).

Fig. 19.1. Energy levels of H 0 and H 1

Let us now consider the normalization. From ψn1 |Q− Q+ |ψn1 = En1 ψn1 |ψn1
one sees the following: If |ψn1 is normalized to unity, then
1
|ψn0 =  Q+ |ψn1
En1

(19.14a)

is also normalized to unity. An analogous relation holds for |ψn0 :
1
|ψn1 =  Q− |ψn0
En0

.

(19.14b)

With the modiﬁed notation for the ground state wave function ψ00 (containing the upper suﬃx 0) of H 0 , we deﬁne

The corresponding energy eigenvalues are also Ek1 . The continuum states
(19.25) have the remarkable property of possessing no reﬂected waves. Potentials of the type (19.21) are therefore called reﬂection-free potentials. (See
also Problem 3.6, where the eigenstates are determined by elementary methods.)
Remark: Why is there no state satisfying Q− Q+ ψ = 0 ?
For a normalizable wave function, this would lead to Q+ ψ = 0. This implies ψ =
cosh x, a non-normalizable wave function. Since this contradicts the assumption,
no state of the problem H 1 exists with energy E = 0. Moreover, for the examples
investigated here, V 1 (x) ≥ V 0 (x), i.e., V 1 is more repulsive. This is in complete
analogy to the nonexistence of eigenstates of a† in the case of the harmonic oscillator
(see Chap. 3).

The two SUSY partners are the reﬂection-free potentials −1/ cosh2 x with
amplitudes n(n − 1)/2 and (n + 1)n/2, where the continuum begins at n2 /2.
Thus, by successive application of SUSY quantum mechanics, one can obtain
the eigenstates of the reﬂection-free potential −n(n + 1)/2 cosh2 x from the
free motion of a particle.

be applied to Hl and Hl+1 . In particular,

Enl (Q−

2

(19.50)

Hence, Q−
l unl is an eigenfunction of Hl+1 with eigenvalue mEnl / . One can
immediately convince oneself of (19.50) directly by replacing Hl by (19.47a)
in (19.42), multiplying by Q−
l , and substituting (19.47b). Similarly,

Hl+1 un,l+1 =

(19.51)

yields the eigenvalue equation
Hl Q+
l un,l+1 =

m
En,l+1 Q+

2

.

(19.52)

Hence, Q+
l un,l+1 is an eigenfunction of Hl .
We must now determine the value of the principal quantum numbers
+
of Q−
l un,l and Ql un,l+1 . We will see that this is also n. Beginning with
ul+1,l , l ≥ 1, we can construct Q+
l−1 ul+1,l , with energy eigenvalue El+1,l =
−ηl 2 /m. The ground state for l − 1, ul,l−1 , has energy El,l−1 = −ηl−1 2 /m.
We claim that no further state lies between these two, i.e., Q+
l−1 ul+1,l ∝
ul+1,l−1 . Suppose that there were another state lying between these two. One
could then apply the operator Q−
l−1 to it and would then obtain an eigenstate
of Hl with eigenvalue below El+1,l , which is impossible. Continuing this line
of argument, one obtains
Q+
l un,l+1 ∝ un,l

.

(19.53)

Now that all the bound states and eigenvalues, beginning with ul+1,l , can be
determined (see Fig. 19.2), it then also follows that
Q−
l un,l ∝ un,l+1 (n > l + 1) .
We now express these results in terms of the principal quantum number n.
Starting with (19.49), the state un,n−1 , we obtain all the states with principal
quantum number n:

+
un,n−1 , Q+
n−2 un,n−1 , Qn−3 Qn−2 un,n−1 , . . .

19.3 Additional Remarks
Supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which has a close relationship to supersymmetric ﬁeld theory, is the study of quantum mechanical systems whose
Hamiltonian H is constructed from anticommuting charges Q which are the
square root of H:
2H = {Q, Q† } = QQ† + Q† Q

,

(19.56)

0 = {Q, Q} .

(19.57)

This implies
[Q, H] = 0

;

(19.58)

i.e., the charge is conserved. This type of Hamiltonian contains coordinates
which are quantized by commutators and anticommutators. These are mixed
by supersymmetry transformations. For a particle with spin, the position and
spin orientation form a pair of such coordinates. The explicit realization of
Q and Q† is then
Q = (p + iΦ(x))ψ̂ †

, Q† = (p − iΦ(x))ψ̂

,

(19.59)

in which x and p are Bose degrees of freedom, whereas ψ̂ and ψ̂ † are Fermi
degrees of freedom, with the corresponding commutation (anticommutation)
relations ( = 1)
[x, p] = i ,
{ψ̂ † , ψ̂} = 1 , {ψ̂, ψ̂} = {ψ̂ † , ψ̂ † } = 0 .

(19.60)

This yields {Q† , Q† } = {Q, Q} = 0 and
H = 12 p2 + 12 Φ2 (x) − 12 [ψ̂ † , ψ̂]Φ (x)

we ﬁnd from (19.61)
H = 12 (p2 + Φ2 (x)) + 12 σz Φ (x)

.

(19.63)

Equation (19.63) is identical to the previous matrix representation of the
two Hamiltonians H 0 and H 1 . The sectors H 0 and H 1 are known as Bose and
Fermi sectors, respectively. These two sectors have the same energy levels.
The only exception is the case in which the ground state of the Bose sector
has zero energy and is thus nondegenerate.
Remark: Finally, it deserves to be mentioned that the supersymmetry transformations are represented by the unitary operator2
U = exp {εQ + ε† Q† }

(19.64)
†

with anticommuting c-numbers ε and ε (Grassmann algebra).
Supersymmetric one-particle quantum mechanics serves as a model for the investigation of spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry, which is supposed to occur
in supersymmetric ﬁeld theories.2 The ground state |0 is invariant with respect to
supersymmetry transformations provided U |0 = |0. This is satisﬁed if and only
if Q|0 = Q† |0 = 0, i.e., if the ground state energy is zero. If the ground state
energy is greater than zero, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. An example
of spontaneously broken supersymmetry is

(19.66)

There is no normalizable state in this case with E00 = 0, since
Z
dx Φ(x) = g( 31 x3 − a2 x) .
The ground state energy then is positive (QQ† !) and degenerate.

in Quantum Mechanics

20.1 The Quantum Mechanical State, Causality,
and Determinism
“There was a time when newspapers said that only twelve men understood
the theory of relativity. I do not believe that there ever was such a time.
. . . On the other hand, I think it is safe to say that no one understands
quantum mechanics.”
R. P. Feynman
The Character of Physical Law (1967) p. 1291

Here, “to understand” does not mean just the mastery of the mathematical
formalism, but rather an understanding within the framework of our conceptual ideas acquired on the basis of classical and nonrelativistic phenomena.
Indeed, one can understand (in this sense of the word) such consequences
of special relativity as the Lorentz contraction or time dilation as soon as
one has a clear notion of the relativity of simultaneity in coordinate systems
which are in motion with respect to one another. Although the Newtonian
equations are indeed modiﬁed in relativity theory, so that the resulting equations are covariant with respect to Lorentz transformations, the concept of a
state – speciﬁcation of position and velocity – is not altered.
In contrast, the conceptual changes in quantum theory are considerably
more incisive. For one thing, the state is given by a vector in a linear, inﬁnitedimensional space, and the observables are represented by in general noncommuting operators, which ultimately leads to decisive consequences for
the measurement process. Let us recall the axioms of quantum theory:
I. The state is described by a vector |ψ in a linear space.
II. The observables are represented by hermitian operators, and f (observable) is represented by f (operator).
III. The expectation value of an observable is ψ|operator|ψ .
IV. The dynamics are given by the Schrödinger equation
i∂|ψ /∂t = H|ψ .
V. In a measurement of the observable A with the result a, the original state
changes into |a .

20. State and Measurement in Quantum Mechanics

From axioms II and III it follows that a measurement of A gives the
eigenvalues a with probability |ca |2 , where
|ψ = S ca |a and A|a = a|a
a

.

By classical determinism one means the concept that position and momentum, which of course deﬁne the state in classical mechanics, can be speciﬁed
with arbitrary accuracy. In quantum theory, position and momentum do not
simultaneously take precise values, but rather, depending on the wave function, one has a statistical distribution. This situation is nondeterministic. On
the other hand, classical physics and quantum mechanics are causal in the
following sense: For initial values x, p, the values x(t), p(t) at a later time can
be computed from the Newtonian equations; if the initial wave function ψ(x)
is given, the wave function ψ(x, t) follows from the Schrödinger equation. The
change of the state in a measurement, axiom V, is occasionally regarded as
noncausality. What enters here, however, is not so much a lack of causality, but rather a manifestation of the nondeterministic quantum mechanical
state.
Here lies one of the root causes of the conceptual diﬃculties. One must
also be aware that the uncertainty relation, which results from the noncommutivity of the observables, cannot be circumvented, no matter how clever
the experimental setup. Furthermore, in an experiment the state is changed,
the change depending on the type of experiment. For example, let us consider the Heisenberg thought experiment for the determination of position by
means of a microscope with resolving power Δx = λ/ sin ϕ (Fig. 20.1). The
uncertainty of the recoil is given by

20.2 The Density Matrix

371

Can the impact of the photon onto the lens be used for a measurement
of px ? For this purpose, one would have to know the momentum of the lens
more precisely than (2π/λ) sin ϕ. The position of the lens would become
correspondingly imprecise (the mass of the lens does not enter). Since then
the principal maximum and the secondary maxima of the image would be
blurred, the position of the observed particle would then become uncertain.
Here, we also see that, depending on the type of measurement, the state will
be changed.
In the course of this chapter, the following problems will be addressed:
Clariﬁcation of the concept of a state, investigation of the question of whether
quantum theory can be extended by hidden variables, and to what extent
axiom V can be derived by a quantum mechanical treatment of the whole
system. The chapter is subdivided into three main parts: ﬁrst, consideration
of the density matrix, a mathematical scheme for describing the questions
posed; second, analysis of an idealized Stern–Gerlach experiment; and third,
a look at the Bell inequality and experiments proving the impossibility of
local hidden variables.
We remark at the outset that the conceptual diﬃculties which are inherent
in the quantum mechanical state do not imply a weakness of quantum theory,
whose validity has never encountered limitations, but only a weakness of our
imagination.

20.2 The Density Matrix
20.2.1 The Density Matrix for Pure and Mixed Ensembles
The density matrix is of prime signiﬁcance for the formulation of quantum
statistics. In this ﬁeld, the terms “statistical operator” and “density operator”
are used interchangeably for the density matrix.
Let the system be in the state |ψ . In this state, the observable A has the
expectation value
A = ψ|A|ψ

.

(20.1)

The structure of the expectation value suggests that we deﬁne the density
matrix
 = |ψ ψ|

.

(20.2)

One has
A = tr (A) ,

(20.3a)

tr  = 1

(20.3d)

Here, the deﬁnition of the trace is

tr X =
n|X|n ,

(20.4)

n

where {|n } is an arbitrary complete orthonormal system.

and thus the trace is independent of the basis.

If the systems or objects under investigation are all in one and the same
state |ψ , one speaks of a pure ensemble, or one says that the system is in a
pure state.
In order to verify the probability predictions contained in the wave function |ψ experimentally, one must in fact investigate an ensemble of identically
prepared objects. If for example

cn |n ,
(20.5)
|ψ =
n

the eigenvalue an will result in an ensemble of N such objects Nn times. The
larger N , the more precisely Nn /N approaches the probability |cn |2 , i.e.,
Nn
N →∞ N

|cn |2 = lim

(20.6)

and the expectation value correspondingly becomes

|cn |2 an = lim

(20.7)

20.2 The Density Matrix

373

In addition to this inherent statistical character residing in the states
themselves, an ensemble can also contain a statistical distribution of states.
If an ensemble with distinct states is present, one refers to this as a mixed
ensemble, a mixture, or one speaks of a mixed state. Suppose that, of the
N representatives of the ensemble, N1 are in the state |ψ1 , . . . , Ni in the
state |ψi , . . . ; then the probability that an arbitrarily chosen element of the
ensemble is in the state |ψi is given by pi = Ni /N , with

pi = 1 .
i

The expectation value of A is then

A =
pi ψi |A|ψi .

Let the system consist of two subsystems 1 and 2 with orthonormal states

that tr1 ˆ2 = 1 holds only under the above assumption, whereas otherwise
ˆ represents the density matrix of a mixed ensemble. If the information of
a subspace is ignored, the pure state becomes a mixed state. Although the
total system is in the pure state (20.13), the density matrix ˆ, which yields
all expectation values pertaining only to subsystem 1, in general represents
a mixed ensemble.
Projection operators
The projection operator in subspace 2, |2m 2m|, projects onto the state
|2m . Application to the state (20.13) yields

cnm |1n |2m .
(20.17a)
|ψ → |2m 2m|ψ =

Under projection onto the state |2m , the density matrix is changed as follows:
 →

tr1 2m||2m

(20.17b)

If  represents a pure ensemble, then this is also the case for the projected
density matrix.
Filters can be represented mathematically by the application of projection
operators onto the density matrix.

This is the von Neumann equation, which also holds for time dependent
Hamiltonians. It describes the time evolution of the density matrix in the
Schrödinger picture. Note that the equation of motion for  should under no
circumstances be confused with the equation of motion for operators in the
Heisenberg representation, see Sect. 8.5.2. The von Neumann equation is the
quantum mechanical analog of the Liouville equation of classical statistical
mechanics.
From (20.18), for an arbitrary density matrix at initial time t0 , the formal
solution (16.4) of the Schrödinger equation
|ψ(t) = U (t, t0 )|ψ(t0 )

(20.19)

yields, together with (16.5), the solution of the initial-value problem
(t) = U (t, t0 )(t0 )U (t, t0 )†

Theorem. The quantity tr 2 is time independent. Hence, a pure (mixed)
state remains pure (mixed).
Proof:
tr 2 (t) = tr U (t0 )U † U (t0 )U † = tr 2 (t0 )

,

by the cyclic invariance of the trace.
The density matrix in the Heisenberg representation
(t0 ) = U (t, t0 )† (t)U (t, t0 )
is time independent.

The expectation value of the observable A is given in these two representations by
A = tr ((t)A) = tr ((t0 )AH (t)) ,

(20.22)

where AH (t) = U † (t, t0 )AU (t, t0 ) is the Heisenberg operator. The time dependence of the expectation value derives, in the Schrödinger picture, from
the density matrix, and, in the Heisenberg picture, from the operator.
20.2.3 Spin-1/2 Systems
The situation is especially transparent in state spaces of low dimension. In
particular, we consider spin-1/2 systems. The states |↑ , i.e.,

χ+ =
0
and |↓ , i.e.,
 
0

χ− =

are eigenstates of σz ; (σz χ± = ± χ± ).
We will use both Dirac notation and the spinor representation, depending
on what is convenient, and we recall the Pauli spin matrices (9.14).
Let us ﬁrst discuss rotations in spin space. A rotation through an angle
ϑ about the axis n̂ is represented by the unitary transformation

U σU † = n̂(n̂ · σ) − n̂ × (n̂ × σ) cos ϑ + n̂ × σ sin ϑ

Applying (20.25) to χ± , we ﬁnd
Ux (t̂ · σ)Ux† χ± = σz χ± = ± χ±
and hence (t̂ · σ)(Ux† χ± ) = ± (Ux† χ± ).
The two eigenfunctions of t̂ · σ are therefore given by

A rotation through ϑ = 2π gives U = −1l and χ → −χ. In a rotation through
360◦ , the spinor changes its sign. It takes a rotation through ϑ = 4π to
produce U = +1l and χ → +χ. This illustrates the spinor properties of χ± ,
whereas (20.24) expresses the vector character of σ.
We now return to the density matrix and discuss its spin part. For deﬁniteness, we can imagine that we are dealing with electron beams. An electron
beam of spin ↑ has the density matrix ↑ = |↑ ↑|, while an electron beam of
spin ↓ has the density matrix ↓ = |↓ ↓|. If one mixes the two beams in the
ratio 50:50, the density matrix is
M = 12 (|↑ ↑| + |↓ ↓|)

.

(20.28)

This is indeed a mixed state, since
2M = 12 M

.

(20.29)

Let us compare this to the pure state
1
| = √ (|↑ + eiα |↓ )
2

,

(20.30)

consisting of the linear superposition of |↑ and |↓ . The corresponding density
matrix is
α = 12 (|↑ ↑| + |↓ ↓| + e−iα |↑ ↓| + eiα |↓ ↑|) .

(20.31)

In contrast to M , here, interference terms occur. Let us also give the matrix
representation

20.2 The Density Matrix

with n, m =↑, ↓ for the two density matrices (20.28) and (20.31):

(20.33a,b)
, α =

The diﬀerence between the two density matrices also makes itself felt in the
expectation values and thus has measurable consequences. For the pure state,
A α = 12 ( ↑| A |↑ + ↓| A |↓ + 2 Re eiα ↑| A |↓ ) ,

(20.34)

whereas for the mixture
A M = 12 ( ↑| A |↑ + ↓| A |↓ )

(20.35)

holds. In both cases, the expectation value of σz is zero; in contrast, the
expectation value of σx for the pure state is Re exp {iα} = cos α and thus is
not equal to zero for α = π/2, whereas it vanishes for the mixture.
Interference terms are present in the density matrix and in the expectation
values of the pure state. Comparison of the two density matrices shows that
the mixture arises by superposition of the α or averaging over the phases:
 2π

M =

Polarization of spin-1/2 particles
The most general density matrix in spin space is
 = 12 (1l + b · σ) ,

(20.37)

since every 2 × 2-matrix can be represented as a linear combination of the
unit matrix and the Pauli matrices, and furthermore tr 1l = 2 and tr σi = 0.
Choosing b to point in the z-direction, we ﬁnd


1 1+b

=

0
1−b

Since (1 ± b)/2 are probabilities, |b| ≤ 1 must hold. When does  characterize
a pure case? For this we compute 2 using (9.18b):


1 1 + b2
1
2 = (1l + 2σ · b + (σ · b)(σ · b)) =
1l + σ · b
.
4

2
Thus |b| = 1 is a pure case. Finally let us also compute the expectation value
of σ using tr σi σj = 2δij :
σi = tr σi = tr [ 12 (1l + bj σj )σi ] = bi

.

(20.38)

The expectation value of σ is just b, and the degree of polarization is characterized by b = |b|. The case b = 0 represents an unpolarized beam, whereas
the pure state with b = 1 represents a completely polarized beam.

20.3 The Measurement Process
20.3.1 The Stern–Gerlach Experiment
Let a beam of atoms or electrons move through the inhomogeneous ﬁeld of a
magnet. Because of the force mz (∂Bz /∂z), (1.9), the beam is split depending
on the values of the magnetic moment mz . The experimental setup is shown
schematically in Fig. 20.2.

Fig. 20.2. The Stern–Gerlach experiment; the cross section of the magnet in the
beam direction

In the following, we assume that the total angular momentum, later designated for brevity as the spin, is 1/2. The motion in the y-direction is force-free
and can be separated oﬀ. The Hamiltonian which remains is

describing the motion in the z-direction and the spin in the strong and inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld oriented along the z-direction. Here, we have

.

(20.44)

20.3.2 The Quasiclassical Solution
Although the precise derivation of (20.42) is not important for what follows,
we brieﬂy explain how this classical motion follows from the Schrödinger
equation. We start with the WKB solution for a general potential V (z). The
stationary states corresponding to the energy E are

The heavier the particle and the larger the energy, the better the quasiclassical approximation.
20.3.3 The Stern–Gerlach Experiment
as an Idealized Measurement
We now utilize the Stern–Gerlach experiment as a model for the process of
measurement in quantum mechanics. Here, the object being measured is the

382

20. State and Measurement in Quantum Mechanics

spin of the particle and the measuring apparatus is the position of the particle
after traversing the ﬁeld. We know from (20.42) that
for ↑ , z < 0 , and for ↓ , z > 0 .
This apparatus, whose readout (position of the pointer) is the z-coordinate of
the particle, is thus appropriate for distinguishing ↑ from ↓ (and – by means
of the amount of deﬂection – for determining the size of the moment). The
requirement that the z-coordinate of the particle serve as the pointer of a
measuring instrument implies that the deﬂections must be macroscopically
distinguishable. Formally, this implies that the overlap of the two wave packets f (z + Ct2 ) and f (z − Ct2 ) in (20.42) must be negligible. After having
calibrated the apparatus in this way, we can now investigate general states.
Let us consider the initial state
1
Ψ (z, 0) = √ (χ+ + χ− )f (z) ,
(20.49)
2
which after traversing the ﬁeld becomes
2
1 1
.
Ψ (z, t) = √ χ+ f (z + Ct2 )e−iαt + χ− f (z − Ct2 )eiαt
2

(20.50)

The polarization and the pointer (the z-coordinate) are coupled. There is a
unique correlation between the state of the spin and the state of the pointer.
Neither the spin nor the pointer is in an eigenstate. In the basis of the states
|z |± , the density matrix
zz = ±| z|ψ(t) ψ(t)|z  |±

(20.51)

of the state (20.50) is given by

1
f (z + Ct2 )f (z  + Ct2 )∗
zz =
2 f (z − Ct2 )f (z  + Ct2 )∗ ei2αt


f (z + Ct2 )f (z  − Ct2 )∗ e−i2αt

f (z − Ct2 )f (z  − Ct2 )∗
(20.52)

Measurement of spin observables: After the spin-1/2 particle has passed
through the Stern–Gerlach apparatus, suppose that its spin is measured.
The measurement can take place (i) ignoring the pointer position z or (ii) for
a particular pointer position z.
(i)

If one ignores the pointer position, then  is equivalent to



1 1 0
ˆ ≡
dz z||z =

2 0 1

(20.53)

where the second equality follows from the nonoverlapping of the pointer wave
functions f (z + Ct2 ) and f (z − Ct2 ). For an observable F (σ), depending only
on spin operators,
trz,σ (F (σ)) = trσ (ˆ
F (σ))

.

(20.54)

20.3 The Measurement Process

383

The density matrix ˆ corresponds to a mixed ensemble (see (20.33a)). The
pure ensemble () is replaced by the mixed ensemble (ˆ
).
(ii) Filtering out a “pointer” position: We now consider only the particles
with pointer position “z-positive”, i.e., we construct


 ∞

2 0 1
0
Because of the normalization, the density matrix is then


0 0
≡ ↓ .
0 1

(20.55)

The particles deﬂected up have the spin wave function |↓ .
For a measurement with the result z-positive (spin negative) the state
goes over to |↓ . This is consistent with axiom V, which was postulated earlier
from the requirement that repeated experiments give the same result. For this
simple experiment the time dependent Schrödinger equation for object and
apparatus can be solved explicitly, and axiom V follows from axioms I–IV
of quantum mechanics.
The fact that the particles which have been ﬁltered oﬀ at a particular
pointer position are in that eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue measured is known as reduction of the wave function. Going over from  to ˆ
with respect to all observables related to the spin can also be regarded as
a reduction of the wave function. The density matrix ˆ (20.53) describes an
ensemble composed of 50% spin-up and 50% spin-down states. If N particles
are subjected to this Stern–Gerlach experiment, then as far as their spin
properties are concerned they are completely equivalent to N/2 particles in
the state |↑ and N/2 particles in the state |↓ .
20.3.4 A General Experiment and Coupling to the Environment
We now investigate a general experiment. Let O be the object and A the
apparatus including its readout. At the time t = 0, let the state of the whole
system consisting of object and apparatus be

cn |O, n |A .
(20.56)
|ψ(0) =
n

The |O, n are object states, and |A is the (metastable) initial state of the
apparatus. At a later time t, after the interaction of the object with the
measuring apparatus, the state

cn |O, n |A(n)
(20.57)
|ψ(t) =
n

384

20. State and Measurement in Quantum Mechanics

is realized, where the ﬁnal states of the apparatus |A(n) , n = 1, 2, . . . ,
must be macroscopically distinguishable. The density matrix for the (pure)
state (20.57) is
(t) = |ψ(t) ψ(t)|

.

(20.58)

If we do not read oﬀ the result of the measurement, the density matrix for
observables relevant to the object O is

|cn |2 |O, n O, n| .
(20.59)
ˆ = trA(n) (t) =
n

The fact that the ﬁnal states of the apparatus are macroscopically distinguishable, and thus do not overlap, enters here: A(n)|A(m) = δnm . If we
do not read oﬀ the result of the measurement, a mixture thus occurs with
respect to O.
If on the other hand we read oﬀ a particular value, e.g., A(m), the density
matrix which then applies is
|O, m O, m|

.

(20.60)

The probability of measuring the value A(m) on the apparatus is, by (20.57),
|cm |2 .
The fact that in a measurement with the result A(m) the density matrix
changes from (20.58) to (20.60) is known as reduction of the wave packet
(state).
We now take into account the fact that the object and the apparatus
are never completely isolated from the environment, and we take E to be an
additional variable representing all further macroscopic consequences which
couple to the state A of the apparatus. The initial state is then

cn |O, n |A |E ,
(20.56 )
|ψ(0) =
n

and after passage through the apparatus this evolves into

|ψ(t) =
cn |O, n |A(n) |E(n) .

(20.57 )

n

A correlation of the object and the apparatus with the environment develops. If we do “not read oﬀ E”, which always happens in practice, since we
cannot keep track of all the macroscopic consequences, the pure density matrix |ψ(t) ψ(t)| has to be traced over the environmental degrees of freedom
E. Assuming E(n)|E(n ) = δnn , because of the diﬀerent inﬂuence of the
states n and n on the environment the density matrix of the object and the
apparatus becomes the mixture

ˆ
ˆ=
|cn |2 |A(n) |O, n O, n| A(n)| .
(20.61)
n

20.3 The Measurement Process

385

The subsystem object + apparatus is thus in a mixed state. N such subsystems behave like N |c1 |2 subsystems in the state |O, 1 |A(1) , N |c2 |2
subsystems in the state |O, 2 |A(2) , . . . , N |cn |2 subsystems in the state
|O, n |A(n) , . . . . We emphasize the diﬀerence between the density matrix
(20.61) resulting from tracing over the environmental degrees of freedom
E, which no longer contains any oﬀdiagonal elements, and the pure density
(20.58) without coupling to the environment.
(i)

If we do not read oﬀ A(n) either, then ˆ
ˆ is equivalent to

|cn |2 |O, n O, n| .
ˆ =
n

(ii) If we read oﬀ A(n), then the probability of obtaining the particular
reading A(m) is
ˆ
ˆ = |cm |2
trO,A (|A(m) A(m)| )

.

And in this case, the density matrix which then applies is
|A(m) |O, m O, m| A(m)|

.

From then on, it does not matter if we disregard A. Taking the trace
over A(n) yields for the observable O the density matrix |O, m O, m|.
The key problem in the theory of measurement is the reduction of the wave
function and in particular the question of when it takes place. This problem
is illustrated quite drastically by means of “Schrödinger’s cat”: Suppose that
a cat within a closed box is killed by a |↑ -particle but not by a |↓ -particle.
Now consider the eﬀect of the state (|↑ + |↓ ), which for instance can be
produced by a Stern–Gerlach apparatus. Suppose that a particle in the state
(|↑ + |↓ ) hits the cat. The state of the spin and the cat makes a transition
to |↑ |dead cat + |↓ |living cat , a pure state. When is it decided whether
the cat is dead or alive? Just when the observer opens the cat’s box? – An
objective statement independent of the conscious mind of the observer would
be impossible. – What is the consequence of including the observer himself
in the quantum mechanical description?
According to the point of view presented above in connection with (20.56 )
to (20.61), the cat (together with the mechanism for killing it which was not
mentioned above) is linked to other macroscopic objects. These are inﬂuenced
diﬀerently in the two ﬁnal states so that their respective wave functions do
not overlap. For everything that follows, these macroscopic consequences are
not recorded; they are traced over. The ﬁnal state of the cat is described by
a mixture of states, Eq. (20.61),
)
1(
|↑ |dead dead| ↑| + |↓ |living living| ↓|
,
ρ̂ˆ =
2

386

20. State and Measurement in Quantum Mechanics

containing the states of a dead cat and a living cat. The cat is thus either
dead or alive and not in a pure state |dead cat + |living cat , which would
include both possibilities.
This concludes the essential part of our consideration of measurements;
the two following sections (20.3.5, 20.3.6) just give a few illustrations.
Remark: Generalizing the above considerations to arbitrary macroscopic systems
the following picture emerges. Suppose we prepared a macroscopic system in a linear
superposition of orthogonal states which would lead to distinguishable consequences
in the environment. The interaction with the environment would then cause the
oﬀdiagonal elements of the density matrix of the system to go to zero. The system
considered by itself would ﬁnally ﬁnd itself in one of these states with a probability
which follows both from the initial superposition as well as the density matrix.
The interaction and the entanglement of the object with the environment leads
to mixed density matrices for the subsystems (often paraphrased as a local disappearance of phase relations). For this phenomenon the term “decoherence” is now
generally used.
Linear superpositions of quantum states of macroscopic systems would be affected by decoherence within extremely short times, so that such superpositions
would never be observed in practice. Hence, the interaction with the environment
in eﬀect imposes superselection rules onto the possible quantum states of macroscopic systems. The kind of quantum states which arise because of decoherence are
determined by the nature and the form of the interactions the object experiences.
For example, the scattering processes by molecules of a gas or by photons lead
to localisation of an object. The coherence between macroscopically diﬀerent positions is rapidly destroyed by scattering processes2 . Classical properties emerge in a
practically irreversible manner through the unavoidable and ubiquitous interaction
with the environment.
The interaction with the “environment” leads to the emergence of a preferred
set of states3 of the system amongst which no phase relations (i.e., no linear superpositions) or nondiagonal terms in the density matrix survive. These states
belong to the basis of operators which commute with the interaction Hamiltonian
of the system and the environment and they can be distinguished through their
eﬀect on the environment. The continuous interaction with the environment leads
to a rapid destruction of superpositions of these states. This again, leads us to the
environment-induced superselection rules and the ensuing classical properties.
The term superselection rule used above has been introduced by Wick, Wigner
and Wightman to denote fundamental restrictions on the linear superposition of
states. For example, the superposition of states with diﬀerent electric charge or
integer and half-odd-integer spin is excluded. In the case of decoherence the superselection rules are generated dynamically by the interaction with the environment,
and possess a range of approximate validity dependent on the speciﬁc situation.
Returning again to (20.56 ) to (20.61), we may interpret the transition from the
pure state (20.56 ) (designated in this context as “coherent”) to the mixture (20.61)
as follows: Due to the entanglement of the object-apparatus states with those of

20.3 The Measurement Process

387

the environment states, the coherence of the wave function of the object-apparatus
disappears locally. Nevertheless, the extended system (object, apparatus and environment) is still in a pure state and there has been no reduction (collapse) of the
overall wave function. Yet, for the object and the apparatus considered by itself, the
consequences of the coupling to the environment are, for all practical purposes, as
though the environment had acted as an “observer” without revealing the outcome.

20.3.5 Inﬂuence of an Observation on the Time Evolution
In order to further analyze the measurement process and its impact, let us
return to the Stern–Gerlach experiment and consider the following additional
setup. After the atomic beams have traversed the Stern–Gerlach apparatus,
we recombine them by means of a complicated ﬁeld conﬁguration in such a
way that all of the deformation and spreading of the wave function is carefully
undone, i.e., the state
f (z)(c1 eiϕ+ χ+ + c2 eiϕ− χ− )

(20.62)

is formed. This again is essentially the initial wave function – up to the free
motion in the y-direction, which is suppressed here. The phases ϕ± which
have been inserted characterize path length diﬀerences.
Now, in the region where the beams + and − are macroscopically separated, we can set up a real measuring device whose pointer Z reacts to z
by an interaction U (z − Z), so that positive (negative) z leads to positive
(negative) Z. We then have for the initial state
|ψa = f (z)(c1 χ+ + c2 χ− )|Z = 0

,

(20.63)

for the intermediate state
|ψc = c1 χ+ f (z + Ct2 )|Z = −1 + c2 χ− f (z − Ct2 )|Z = +1

,

(20.64)

and for the state after traversing the entire setup
|ψe = f (z)(c1 χ+ eiϕ+ |Z = −1 + c2 χ− eiϕ− |Z = +1 ) .

(20.65)

The pointer positions are described by |Z = 0 and |Z = ± 1 .
We can now compare the following two situations:
I.

We turn on the coupling to the measuring device Z and obtain the ﬁnal
state (20.65).
II. We turn oﬀ the coupling to the measuring device Z and obtain the ﬁnal
state (20.62), multiplied by |Z = 0 .
The resulting density matrices are quite diﬀerent. Although the state
(20.65) is a pure state, it is equivalent to a mixture, as far as statements
relating only to the particle are concerned. This is due to the fact that the
macroscopic states |Z = ± 1 do not overlap. In situation II, both the total

388

20. State and Measurement in Quantum Mechanics

state and the state of the atom are pure states. In situation I, the ﬁnal state
of the total system atom + pointer (characterized by spin, z, and Z) is a
pure state, whereas the density matrix of the subsystem (spin, z) is mixed,
unless c1 or c2 vanish.
Evidently the physical situation diﬀers according to whether the interaction U (z − Z) between system and pointer is turned on or not. Even if we do
not read oﬀ the result, U still inﬂuences the atomic system.
In order to further illustrate the back-reaction of the experiment on
the object, we consider the following thought experiment.4 We connect two
Stern–Gerlach devices in series (Fig. 20.3). Let the initial state of the atoms
in the atomic beam be |a , let {|e } be a basis for the ﬁnal states, and let
{|c } be a basis for the intermediate states. We now determine the probability of a transition to the ﬁnal state |e , by representing this in terms of the
(1)
(2)
transition amplitudes Uac and Uce of |a to |c and |c to |e .

because c Uac Uce = Uae holds in an isolated system.
On the other hand, one could also say that the transition probability is

The probabilities (20.66) and (20.67) correspond to diﬀerent experiments.

introduces unknown phase factors exp {iϕc } which have to be averaged over.
Experiment 1. Between SG1 and SG2 , the atoms remain unperturbed.
There is no coupling to the external world, and the transition probability
is PaI → e from (20.66).

Experiment 2. Between SG1 and SG2 , there is an inﬂuence on the atoms,
making possible a determination of the stationary state. However, the result
of the measurement is not recorded, and a mixture is formed. The transition
probability is PaII→ e from (20.67).
Experiment 3. Between SG1 and SG2 an inﬂuence on the atoms occurs
making possible a determination of the stationary state. Let us assume that
(2)
c is found. The probability for state e behind SG2 is then given by |Uce |2 .
20.3.6 Phase Relations in the Stern–Gerlach Experiment
It was pointed out earlier that the change of the density matrix of a pure
ensemble into that of a mixed one corresponds to averaging over the phases.
Let us make an order-of-magnitude analysis of the Stern–Gerlach experiment
in order to understand qualitatively why the phase relations between spin-up
and spin-down components are lost. We consider a beam with velocity v and
width b which is split in the ﬁeld of the Stern–Gerlach setup (see Fig. 20.4).
The deﬂection angle of the upper atomic beam is classically

20.4 The EPR Argument, Hidden Variables,
the Bell Inequality
20.4.1 The EPR (Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen) Argument
The nondeterministic character of quantum mechanics is unfamiliar to the
imagination, which is trained in classical phenomena6 . Hence, there were repeated attempts to replace quantum theory by a statistical theory. According
to these, there exist hidden variables, whose values prescribe the values of
all observables for any particular object, except that the hidden variables
are unknown to the experimenter, thus yielding the probabilistic character
of the theory. The probabilistic character of quantum mechanics would then
be quite analogous to that of classical statistical mechanics, where one can
imagine that the motion of all particles is in principle known. For example,
let us consider a particle of spin 1/2 in an eigenstate of Sx with eigenvalue
/2. According to quantum mechanics, the z-component is not ﬁxed. If one
measures it for a very large number of such particles, one ﬁnds 50 % of the
time /2 and 50 % of the time −/2. According to the idea of hidden variables, for each particle, parameters unknown to us would determine whether
+/2 or −/2 results. These hidden variables would prescribe ± /2 each
50 % of the time.
5

In order to visualize the consequence of this, we imagine that we recombine the
two partial beams along the y-axis by means of an additional device – without
attempting to remove the spreading and the associated variation of the phase,
so that the result will not be the state (20.62). Then the density matrix would
still be equivalent to that of a mixture for spin measurements. Indeed, this happens not as in (20.53) because of the nonoverlapping of the two beams, but
rather because there is an eﬀective averaging over all phases in the z-integration
(compare (20.36)).
6
Einstein expressed his rejection of quantum theoretical indeterminism by the
remark “God does not play dice”. Another often cited remark, which reﬂects
Einstein’s rejection of the fact that the value of a nondiagonal observable is ﬁxed
only when an experiment is performed, is the question: “Is the moon there when
nobody looks?”
Even Schrödinger, one of the founders of quantum theory, who sought to construct a classical continuum theory of the microworld, was dissatisﬁed with the
probability interpretation: “If we have to keep these damned quantum jumps, I
regret that I ever had anything to do with quantum theory.”

20.4 The EPR Argument, Hidden Variables, the Bell Inequality

391

By means of a number of thought experiments, Einstein attempted to
demonstrate the incompleteness of the quantum mechanical description and
to get around the indeterminism and the uncertainty relation. Each of these
arguments was refuted in turn by Bohr.
An argument – sometimes referred to as a paradox – due to Einstein,
Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR), played a pivotal role in the discussion of indeterminism and the existence of hidden variables; we consider this argument
as reformulated by D. Bohm.
Let two spin-1/2 particles in a singlet state
1
|0, 0 = √ (|↑ |↓ − |↓ |↑ )
2

(20.71)

be emitted from a source and move apart. Even if the two particles are
separated by an arbitrarily large distance and can no longer communicate
with one another, one ﬁnds in the state (20.71) the following correlations in a
measurement of the one-particle spin states: If one measures the z-component
of the spin and ﬁnds for particle 1 spin up, particle 2 then has spin down. If one
ﬁnds for particle 1 spin down, particle 2 has spin up. If instead one measures
Sx , then +/2 for particle 1 implies the value −/2 for particle 2, etc.
This expresses the nonlocality of quantum theory. The experiment on
particle 1 inﬂuences the result of the experiment on particle 2, although they
are widely separated. The nonlocality is a consequence of the existence of
correlated many-particle states such as the direct product |↑ |↓ and the fact
that one can linearly superimpose such states. The nonlocality of quantum
mechanics does not lead to contradictions with relativity theory. Although a
measurement of a spin component of particle 1 immediately reveals the value
of that component for particle 2, no information can be transmitted in this
way. Since particle 1 takes values ± /2 50 % of the time, this remains true
for particle 2, even after the measurement of particle 1. Only by subsequent
comparison of the results is it possible to verify the correlation.
Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen7 gave the following argument in favor
of hidden parameters in conjunction with the EPR thought experiment:
7

The original argumentation of EPR does not refer to singlet states, but to two
identical particles, say decay products, moving apart in opposite directions with
equal speeds. If the position of particle 1 is measured and the value x is found,
then particle 2 has position −x. If the momentum of particle 1 is measured with
value p, then particle 2 has the momentum −p. Here as well, the position and
the momentum are ﬁxed neither for particle 1 nor for particle 2, but there is
a nonlocal entanglement (Verschränkung)8 between the values for particles 1
and 2. The signiﬁcance of the reformulated variant of the EPR thought experiment consists in the experimental realization and the possibility of testing the
existence of hidden variables.
8
States such as (20.71), (20.57) and (20.57 ) are examples of superpositions of
nonoverlapping product states of two or more diﬀerent degrees of freedom. These
cannot be factorized into a single direct product. Following Schrödinger (see

392

20. State and Measurement in Quantum Mechanics

Through the measurement of Sz or Sx of particle 1, the values of Sz or
Sx of particle 2 are known. Because of the separation of the particles, there
was no inﬂuence on particle 2, and therefore the values of Sz , Sx etc. must
have been ﬁxed before the experiment. Thus, there must be a more complete
theory with hidden variables. In the EPR argument, the consequences of the
quantum mechanical state (20.71) are used, but the inherent nonlocality of
quantum theory is denied.
There is no room here to go into the various stages of hidden-variable
theories and their connection to the von Neumann counterargument and
Bohm’s new formulation of the guide wave interpretation, implying classical
equations of motion with an additional quantum potential. We refer the interested reader to the book by Baumann and Sexl9 .
In what follows, we will consider local hidden variables. These would predetermine which value each of the components of S of particle 1 has and
likewise for particle 2. Each of the particles would carry this information
independently of the other.
20.4.2 The Bell Inequality
We now show that such local hidden variables lead to results diﬀerent from
those of quantum mechanics. We then compare with experiment.
To this end, we consider a correlation experiment in which a particle of
total spin zero decays into two particles each with spin 1/2. At a suﬃciently
large distance from the source, a rotatable polarizer and a detector are set up
for each particle (see Fig. 20.5), so that the particles can be registered and
investigated for a correlation of the spin orientation. Polarizer 1 with angular
setting α only lets particle 1 through if its spin in the direction n̂α takes the
value +/2, and polarizer 2 with angular setting β lets particle 2 through
only if its spin in the direction n̂β takes the value +/2. Two detectors 1
and 2 register the particles. If they respond, the spin is positive, otherwise
negative.
literature at the end of this chapter) they are called entangled (verschränkt) for
the following reason. For any of the degrees of freedom the outcome of an experiment is uncertain and only characterized by a probability amplitude. Yet, if one
of the degrees of freedom is measured, the other is known too. The investigation of entangled states has been fundamental in the study of the measurement
process and other basic questions of quantum theory. Recently, the possibility of
using entangled states for applications in quantum information processing has
been focused on: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation and quantum
computing. In fact the appearance of decoherence represents one of the basic
diﬃculties to the experimental realization of quantum computers.

Fig. 20.5. The EPR correlation experiment, with source, polarizers P1 and P2
oriented perpendicular to the beams, and detectors D1 and D2

We consider the correlation between various angular settings of the polarization experiment. A measure of the correlation is N (α; β), deﬁned by the
relative number of experiments resulting in particle 1 at angle α positive and
particle 2 at angle β positive.
Quantum mechanics gives
N (α; β) ≡ 0, 0|δσ1 ·n̂α ,1 δσ2 ·n̂β ,1 |0, 0
= 0, 0| 21 (1 + σ 1 · n̂α ) 12 (1 + σ 2 · n̂β )|0, 0
= 0, 0| 21 (1 + σ 1 · n̂α ) 12 (1 − σ 1 · n̂β )|0, 0
= 14 (1 − n̂α · n̂β ) ,

(20.72)

since 0, 0|σ 1 |0, 0 = 0 in the singlet state |0, 0 . For coplanar detectors (2.72)
reduces to
N (α; β) =

1
β−α
sin2
2
2

(20.72 )

.

If hidden variables were really present in nature, we could represent N (α; β)
by the following sum:
N (α; β) = N (αγ; β) + N (α; γβ)

.

(20.73)

Here, N (αγ; β) is the relative number of particle pairs in which particle 1 has
positive spin at the angles α and γ and negative spin at β, while N (α; βγ) is
the relative number of particle pairs in which instead particle 1 has negative
spin at γ. In theories with hidden variables, all of these quantities are available. Now, one has N (αγ; β) ≤ N (γ; β), since N (γ; β) = N (αγ; β)+N (γ; βα)
and since both quantities on the right-hand side are nonnegative; similarly,
N (α; γβ) ≤ N (α; γ). Hence, (20.73) implies
N (α; β) ≤ N (α; γ) + N (γ; β) .
This is a simple version of the Bell inequality.

(20.74)

Remarks:
(i)

In experiments one often works with the correlation deﬁned by
P (α; β) = 0, 0|σ 1 · n̂α σ 2 · n̂β |0, 0
= 4N (α; β) − 1

,

(20.75)


instead of N (α; β) itself. Quantum mechanics (20.72 ) yields for coplanar polarizers
P (α − β) ≡ P (α; β) = − cos (α − β)

.

(20.72 )

In terms of these quantities the Bell inequality reads
P (α; β) − 1 ≤ P (α; γ) + P (γ; β)
(ii)

.

The limit prescribed by the Bell inequality can be determined as follows.
In (20.74) one substitutes for α, β, γ the values 0, π, π/2, respectively:
“π ”
“ π”
+N
;π
.
N (0; π) ≤ N 0;

2
In the singlet state, N (0; π) = 12 and N (0; π2 ) = N ( π2 ; π); hence N (0; π2 ) ≥ 14 .
Additional values are obtained by successive combination of angles.

395

Finally, we contrast the consequences of the Bell inequality with quantum mechanics and compare with experiments. To this end, we compute
N (α; β), N (α; γ), and N (γ; β) for the three angles α = 0, γ = 45◦ , and β =
90◦ according to the quantum mechanical formula (20.72 ): (1/2) sin2 45◦ ,
(1/2) sin2 22.5◦ , (1/2) sin2 22.5◦ . Substituting into the Bell inequality (20.74),
one would obtain for these probability densities the inequality
sin2 45◦ ≤ 2 sin2 22.5◦
or 0.5 ≤ 0.29, which is evidently violated. Hence, quantum mechanics and local hidden variables are incompatible. The comparison of quantum mechanics
and the Bell inequality is illustrated in Fig. 20.6(a). The violation of the Bell
inequality was demonstrated experimentally by Lamehi-Rachti and Mittig
with pairs of protons and by Aspect et al. with photons; see Fig. 20.6(b).
Experiment provides decisive evidence in favor of quantum mechanics and
against local hidden variables.

A.3 Green’s Functions
Starting from a linear diﬀerential operator D and a function f (x), we study
the linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation
Dψ(x) = f (x)

(A.30)

for ψ(x).
Replacing the inhomogeneity by a δ-distribution located at x , one ﬁnds
DG(x, x ) = δ(x − x )

.

(A.31)

The quantity G(x, x ) is called the Green’s function of the diﬀerential operator
D. For translationally invariant D, G(x, x ) = G(x − x ).
Using the Green’s function, one ﬁnds for the general solution of (A.30)

ψ(x) = ψ0 (x) + dx G(x, x )f (x ) ,
(A.32)
where ψ0 (x) is the general solution of the homogeneous diﬀerential equation
Dψ0 (x) = 0 .

(A.33)

Equation (A.32) contains a particular solution of the inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation (A.30), given by the second term, which is not restricted to
any special form of the inhomogeneity f (x). A great advantage of the Green’s
function is that, once it has been determined from (A.31), it enables one to
compute a particular solution for arbitrary inhomogeneities.
In scattering theory, we require the Green’s function for the wave equation
(∇2 + k 2 )G(x − x ) = δ (3) (x − x ) .
The Fourier transform of G(x − x )

G̃(q) = d3 y e−iq · y G(y)

(A.35)

becomes, with (A.34),
(−q 2 + k 2 )G̃(q) = 1

.

Inverting (A.35) and using (A.36), one ﬁrst obtains for the Green’s function

However, because of the poles at ± k, the integral in (A.37) does not exist
(k > 0). In order to obtain a well deﬁned integral, we must displace the poles
by an inﬁnitesimal amount from the real axis:

In the integrand of G+ , the poles are at the locations q = ± (k + iε/2k), and
in the integrand of G− , they are at q = ± (k − iε/2k). From this one sees that
the shift of the poles of G+ in the limit ε → 0 is equivalent to deforming the
path of integration along the real axis as shown in Fig. 18.2. After carrying
out the angular integration, one ﬁnds

Since r = |x| > 0, the path of integration can be closed by an inﬁnite
semicircle in the upper half-plane, so that the residue theorem then yields

.

(A.40)

The quantity G+ is called the retarded Green’s function. The solution (A.32)
is composed of a free solution of the wave equation and an outgoing spherical
wave.
The quantity G− is called the advanced Green’s function. The solution (A.32) then consists of a free solution of the wave equation and an
incoming spherical wave.

C. Algebraic Determination
of the Orbital Angular Momentum Eigenfunctions
We now determine the eigenfunctions of orbital angular momentum algebraically. For this we deﬁne
x± = x ± iy

.

(C.1)

The following commutation relations hold:
[Lz , x± ] = ± x± , [L± , x± ] = 0

, [L± , x∓ ] = ± 2z

,

C. Algebraic Determination

[L2 , x+ ] = Lz x+ + x+ Lz + 2 x+ − 2zL+
= 2x+ Lz + 22 x+ − 2zL+

,

(C.2a)

where
L2 = L2z + Lz + L− L+

(C.2b)

has been used.
From (C.2a), (C.2b) and relations (5.14) and (5.15), which were also
shown algebraically, it follows that
Lz x+ |l, l = x+ Lz |l, l + x+ |l, l = (l + 1)x+ |l, l

(C.3a)

and
L2 x+ |l, l = 2 l(l + 1)x+ |l, l + 22 (l + 1)x+ |l, l
= 2 (l + 1)(l + 2)x+ |l, l
