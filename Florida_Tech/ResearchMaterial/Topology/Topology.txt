2. Let (X, T ) be a topological space with the property that every subset is closed. Prove that it is a discrete space.

S ⊆ X =⇒ X\S is open =⇒ X\S ∈ T
T ∈ T =⇒ X\T is closed =⇒ T ⊆ X

3. Observe that if (X, T ) is a discrete space or an indiscrete space, then every open set is a clopen set. Find a topology
T on the set X = {a, b, c, d} which is not discrete and is not indiscrete but has the property that every open set is
clopen.
Let T = {X, ∅, {a}, {b, c, d}}
4. Let X be an infinite set. If T is a topology on X such that every infinite subset of X is closed, prove that T is the
discrete topology.

S ⊆ X and |S| = ∞
|X\S| < ∞ =⇒ X\S is open
there are an infinite number of finite subsets whose compliment is infinite and closed. These are precisely what
make up a discrete topology.
5. Let X be an infinite set and T a topology on X with the property that the only infinite subset of X which is open
is X itself. Is (X, T ) necessarily an indiscrete space?
6.

(i) Let T be a topology on a set X such that T consists of precisely for sets; that is, T = {X, ∅, A, B}, where
A and B are non-empty distinct proper subsets of X. [A is a proper subset of X means that A ⊆ X and
A 6= X. This si denoted by A ⊂ X.] Prove that A and B must satisfy exactly one of the following conditions.
(a) B = X\A; (b) A ⊂ B; (c) B ⊂ A;
[Hint. Firstly show that A and B must satisfy at least one of the conditions and then show that they cannot
satisfy more than one of the conditions.]
(ii) Using (i) list all topologies on X = {1, 2, 3, 4} which consist of exactly four sets.

7.

(i) A recorded in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_topological_space, the number of distinct topologies on a set with n ∈ N points can be very large even for small n; namely when n = 2, there are 4 topologies;
when n = 3, there are 29 topologies: when n = 4, there are 355 topologies; when n = 5, there are 6942
topologies etc. Using mathematical induction, prove that as n increases the number of topologies increases.
(ii) Using mathematical induction prove that if the finite set X has n ∈ N then it has at least (n − 1)! distinct
topolgies.
(iii) If X is any infintie set of cardinality N, prove that there are at least 2N distinct topologies on X. Deduce that
every infinite set has an uncountable number of distinct topolgies on it.

Important Definitions
50.1

Basic and T-spaces

Definition 50.1.1 (Discrete/Indiscrete Topologies). Let X be any non-empty set and let T be the collection of all
subsets of X . Then topological space (X, T ) is called the discrete topology on the set X.
Let X be any non-empty set and is called the indiscrete topology and (X, T ) → T = {X, ∅}.
Definition 50.1.2 (Finite-Closed Topologies). Let X be any non-empty set. A topology T on X is called the finiteclosed topology or the cofinite topology if the closed subsets of X are X and all finite subsets of X ; that is, the
open sets are ∅ and all subsets of X which have finite complements.
Definition 50.1.3 (Countable-Closed Topologies).
Definition 50.1.4 (T0 Spaces). A topological space (X, T ) is said to be a T0 -space if for each pair of distinct points
a, b in X, either there exist an open set containing a and not b, or there exists an open set containing b and not a.
Definition 50.1.5 (T1 Spaces). A topological space (X, T ) is said to be a T1 -space if every singleton set {x} is closed
in (X, T ).
Definition 50.1.6 (T2 Space or Hausdorf). A topological space (X, T ) is said to be Hausdorff (or a T2 -space) if given
any pair of distinct points a, b in X there exist open sets U and V such that a ∈ U, b ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅ .
Definition 50.1.7 (T3 Spaces, Regular Space). A topological space (X, T ) is said to be a regular space if for any closed
subset A of X and any point x ∈ X\A, there exist open sets U and V such that x ∈ U, A ⊆ V , and U ∩ V = ∅ . If (X, T )
is regular and a T1 -space, then it is said to be a T3 -space
Definition 50.1.8 (Dense). Let A be a subset of a topological space (X, T ). Then, A is said to be dense in X or
everywhere dense in X if A = X.

Remark 50.2.1. Preserved by Homeomorphisms
1. T0 -space;

6. Second Axiom of Countability.
7. Separable Space;

Remark 50.2.2. two spaces (X, T ) and (Y, T1 ) cannot be homeomorphic if X and Y have different cardinalities (e.g. X
is countable and Y is uncountable) or if T and T1 have different cardinalities.

Countability and Topologies

Definition 50.3.1 (Countable-closed topology). Let X be any infinite set. The countable-closed topology is defined
to be the topology having as its closed sets X and all countable subsets of X.
Definition 50.3.2 (Second Axiom of Countability). A topological space (X, T ) is said to satisfy the second axiom of
countability or to be second countable if there exists a basis B for T , where B consists of only a countable number of
sets.
Definition 50.3.3 (Fσ set). Let (X, T ) be a topological space.
A subset S of X is said to be an Fσ set if it is the union of a countable number of closed sets.
Definition 50.3.4 (Gδ -set). Let (X, T ) be topological space.
A subset T of X is said to be a Gδ -set if it is the intersection of a countable number of open sets.
Definition 50.3.5 (Product Topology). Let B1 be a basis for a topology T1 on a set X and B2 a basis for a topology
T2 on a set Y . the set X × Y consists of all ordered pairs h x, y i , x ∈ X and y ∈ Y . Let B be the collection of subsets of
X × Y consisting of all the sets B1 × B2 where B1 ∈ B1 and B2 ∈ B2 . Prove that B is a basis for a topology on X × Y .
the topology so defined is called the product topology on X × Y .
Definition 50.3.6 (Subbasis). Let (X, T ) be a topological space. A non-empty collection S of open subsets of X is said
to be subbasis of T if the collection of all finite intersections of members of S forms a basis for T .

Miscellaneous

Definition 50.4.1 (Door Space). A topological space (X, T ) is said to be a door space if every subset of X is either
an open set or a closed set (or both)
Definition 50.4.2 (Saturated Topological Space). A subset S of a topological space (X, T ) is said to be saturated if
it is an intersection of open sets in (X, T ).
