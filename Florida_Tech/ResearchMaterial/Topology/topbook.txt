Introduction
Topology is an important and interesting area of mathematics, the study of which
will not only introduce you to new concepts and theorems but also put into context
old ones like continuous functions.

However, to say just this is to understate

the significance of topology. It is so fundamental that its influence is evident in
almost every other branch of mathematics. This makes the study of topology
relevant to all who aspire to be mathematicians whether their first love is (or
will be) algebra, analysis, category theory, chaos, continuum mechanics, dynamics,
geometry, industrial mathematics, mathematical biology, mathematical economics,
mathematical finance, mathematical modelling, mathematical physics, mathematics
of communication, number theory, numerical mathematics, operations research or
statistics. (The substantial bibliography at the end of this book suffices to indicate
that topology does indeed have relevance to all these areas, and more.) Topological
notions like compactness, connectedness and denseness are as basic
mathematicians of today as sets and functions were to those of last century.

to

Topology has several different branches — general topology (also known as pointset topology), algebraic topology, differential topology and topological algebra — the
first, general topology, being the door to the study of the others. I aim in this book
to provide a thorough grounding in general topology. Anyone who conscientiously
studies about the first ten chapters and solves at least half of the exercises will
certainly have such a grounding.
For the reader who has not previously studied an axiomatic branch of mathematics1
such as abstract algebra, learning to write proofs will be a hurdle. To assist you to
learn how to write proofs, in the early chapters I often include an aside which does
not form part of the proof but outlines the thought process which led to the proof.

CHAPTER 0. INTRODUCTION

Asides are indicated in the following manner:
In order to arrive at the proof, I went through this thought process, which
might well be called the “discovery” or “experiment phase”.
However, the reader will learn that while discovery or experimentation is
often essential, nothing can replace a formal proof.

There is an important difference between the use of “or” in English and in
mathematics. In English when you say that statement (a) or statement (b) is true,
you usually mean that statement (a) is true or statement (b) is true but not both .
In mathematics the meaning is different: the “or” is not exclusive. So it means
statement (a) is true or statement (b) is true or statement (a) and statement (b)
are both true. For example x ⩾ 2 or x ⩽ 2. In fact x ⩽ 2 and x ⩾ 2 are both true
when x = 2. This mathematical usage can be misleading at first. For example when
we say “Either statement (a) or statement (b) is true” we mean either statement
(a) is true or statement (b) is true or they are both true. So remember always that
in mathematics, “or” is not exclusive.
A recent addition to the Topology Without Tears book is Appendix 5 which
contains the material for a first graduate course on topological groups. In particular it
contains the beautiful Pontryagin-van Kampen Duality Theorem for locally compact
abelian groups and a description of the structure of locally compact abelian groups.
I first lectured this course at the University College of North Wales in Bangor in
1974. The Inroduction to this Appendix 5 surveys the history of topological group
theory and some important material of the last few decades.
This book is typeset using the beautiful typesetting package, TEX, designed by
Donald Knuth. While this is a very clever software package, it is my strong view
that, wherever possible, the statement of a result and its entire proof should appear
on the same page – this makes it easier for the reader to keep in mind what facts are
known, what you are trying to prove, and what has been proved up to this point in a
proof. So I do not hesitate to leave a blank half-page (or use subtleTEXtypesetting
tricks) if the result will be that the statement of a result and its proof will then be
on the one page.
There are many exercises in this book. Only by working through a good number
of exercises will you master this course. I have not provided answers to the exercises,
and I have no intention of doing so. It is my opinion that there are enough worked

examples and proofs within the text itself, that it is not necessary to provide answers
to exercises – indeed it is probably undesirable to do so. Very often I include new
concepts in the exercises; the concepts which I consider most important will generally
be introduced again in the text.
Harder exercises are indicated by an *.
Readers of this book may wish to communicate with each other regarding
difficulties, solutions to exercises, comments on this book, and further reading.
To make this easier I have created a Facebook Group called “Topology Without
Tears Readers”. You are most welcome to join this Group. Search for the Group,
and then from there join the Group.
Finally, I should mention that mathematical advances are best understood when
considered in their historical context.

This book currently fails to address the

historical context sufficiently. For the present I have had to content myself with notes
on topology personalities in Appendix 2 - these notes largely being extracted from
The MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive [390]. The reader is encouraged to
visit the website The MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive [390] and to read the
full articles as well as articles on other key personalities. But a good understanding
of history is rarely obtained by reading from just one source.
In the context of history, all I will say here is that much of the topology described
in this book was discovered in the first half of the twentieth century. And one could
well say that the centre of gravity for this period of discovery was, Poland. (Borders
have moved considerably.) It would be fair to say that World War II permanently
changed the centre of gravity.

Acknowledgments

The author must first acknowledge Dr Ian D. Macdonald who,
at the University of Queensland, first introduced him in 1967 to
the subject of Topology and who also supervised in 1967/1968
his first research project on varieties of topological groups and
free topological groups, which later became the topic of the

Kluvanek

research for his PhD thesis at Flinders University. The author’s
PhD was supervised by Professor Igor Kluvanek, who introduced
him to free compact abelian groups and to socialism, and who
influenced the author’s approach to teaching mathematics as

CHAPTER 0. INTRODUCTION

did the author’s lecturers: Dr Sheila Oates Williams, Professor
Anne Penfold Street, Professor Rudolf Vyborny, Professor Des
Nicholls, Professor Clive Davis and Dr John Belward at the
University of Queensland. The author’s love of mathematics
was enhanced in 1963-1964 by Professor Graham Jones at
Cavendish Road State High School, and later enriched by
Professor Hanna Neumann and Professor Bernhard H. Neumann
of the Australian National University.
The author’s understanding of category theory and its
significance was developed through discussions with Professor
Gregory Maxwell Kelly of the University of New South Wales
and Professor Saunders MacLane of the University of Chicago,
USA.

MacLane

The author’s knowledge of Banach Space Theory and Topological Vector Space
Theory was enhanced by discussions at the University of Florida in 1970 and 1971
with Joe Diestel and Steve Saxon.
The author has learnt a vast amount of mathematics from, and has had interesting
and very useful conversations on the teaching of mathematics with, his coauthor
Professor Karl Heinrich Hofmann of the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany
and Tulane University in New Orleans, USA.
The author’s love of Topology began with two books on Topology, namely Kelley
[233] and Dugundji [113].
Portions of earlier versions of this book were used at the University of New South
Wales, the University College of North Wales, La Trobe University, University of New
England, University of Wollongong, University of Queensland, University of South
Australia, City College of New York, and the University of Ballarat over a period of
about 40 years and online for about 2 decades. I wish to thank those students who
criticized the earlier versions and identified errors.
Special thanks go to Deborah King and Allison Plant for
pointing out numerous typos, errors and weaknesses in the
presentation.

Thanks also go to several others, some of

them colleagues, including M. H. Alsuwaiyel, Marshall Ash,
Jessica Banks, Ewan Barker, Colin Benner, Henno Brandsma,

CHAPTER 0. INTRODUCTION

Particular thanks go to Rodney Nillsen whose notes on
chaos theory were very useful in preparing the relevant appendix
and to Jack Gray whose excellent University of New South Wales
Lecture Notes “Set Theory and Transfinite Arithmetic", written
in the 1970s, influenced the Appendix on Infinite Set Theory.

Nillsen

In various places in this book, especially Appendix 2, there are historical notes.
I acknowledge two wonderful sources Bourbaki [51] and The MacTutor History of
Mathematics Archive [390].
Initially the book was typset using Donald Knuth’s beautiful
and powerful TEX package. As the book was expanded and
colour introduced, this was translated into LATEX. For the
last 30 years most mathematics books and journals have been
typeset in some variety of TEX or LATEX.
Knuth
Appendix 5 is based on my 1977 book2 ”Pontryagin duality
and the structure of locally compact abelian groups”, Morris
[293]. The 1977 book was based on a course I first gave in
1974 at the University College of North Wales in Bangor, Wales,
UK at the request of Professor Ronald (Ronnie) Brown and
subsequently delivered at the University of New South Wales in
1975 and La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia in 1976.
I am very grateful to Dr Carolyn McPhail Sandison of the
University of Wollongong, who as a present to me, typeset this

book in TEX for me, more than 15 years ago.

Readers’ Compliments

Jeffrey C., USA: “Topology Without Tears has been, and continues to be, the most
accessible rigorous text on topology legally available on the net. Beyond providing a
foundation on general topology, it was the book that made proof click with me. In
so far as LaTeX markup, SID MORRIS has laid the gold standard for a mathematics
texts for online and device viewing.

It displays beautifully in all my devices and

platforms.
The recent additions in quotient spaces and hausdorff dimension are very much
appreciated as well.
Thank you Professor Morris!”

and your book is targeted at a wider audience. You see, my school is undergoing a
savage budget crisis and the mathematics department does not have enough funds
to offer topology so I am learning it on my own because I feel it will give me a
deeper understanding of real and complex analysis”;
Maria Amarakristi O., Nigeria:

“ I am a final year student of Mathematics in

University of Nigeria. . . . I found your book profoundly interesting as it makes the
challenging course - topology more interesting. The presentation is very good and

I found your book very good and easy for the student to understand. I would like to
use your book " TOPOLOGY WITHOUT TEARS" as a text book for my students.
Could you please tell me how to order some copies of the book in Arabic language
for the students and also for the library?”
Michael N., Macau:“Unlike many other math books, your one is written in a friendly
manner. For instance, in the early chapters, you gave hints and analysis to almost all
the proof of the theorems. It makes us, especial the beginners, easier to understand
how to think out the proofs. Besides, after each definition, you always give a number
of examples as well as counterexamples so that we can have a correct and clear idea
of the concept”;
Elise D., UK: “ I am currently studying Topology at Oxford University. I am finding
the book I am currently using is more difficult than expected. My tutor recommended
your book "Topology Without Tears";”
Tarek Fouda, USA: “I study advanced calculus in Stevens institute of technology
to earn masters of science in financial engineering major. It is the first time I am
exposed to the subject of topology. I bought few books but I find yours the only
that explains the subject in such an interesting way and I wish to have the book
with me just to read it in train or school.”

general topology and I fined your book is very interesting”;
Jose V., Uruguay:“n this semester I am teaching Topology in the Facultad de
Ciencias of Universidad de la Republica. I would like to have a printable version
of your (very good) book.”
Muhammad Y. B., Professor of Mathematics, Bayero University, Nigeria: “Your
ebook, ‘Topology Without Tears’, is an excellent resource for anyone requiring the
knowledge of topology. I do teach some analysis courses which assumes basic
background in topology. Unfortunately, some of my students either do not have
such a background, or have forgotten it. After going through the electronic version,
I observe your book would be a good source of refreshing/providing the background
to the students.”

“I have just discovered your excellent text "Topology Without Tears". During this
course, I will be teaching a course on General Topology (actually, I will start my
course tomorrow morning). I started to teach that course last year, and esentially I
followed Munkres’s book (Topology, Second edition), from which I covered Chapters
2, 3, part of 4, 5, and part of 9. I have been reading your book and I have really
enjoyed it. I like it very much, specially the way you introduce new concepts and
also the hints and key remarks that you give to the students.”

with tears’. Topology has been the most difficult area for me (until I found your
book). However I was able to swallow some theorems. But I always stumbled upon
problems. I think it is futile to go further, simply swallowing more theorems without
clearly understanding the subject matter and without being able to solve even a
problem. Having such great difficulty in taking topology, I searched the internet for
some resource which would help me. Most of the stuff I found was more or less
the same to the books and notes that I used to follow. But I was delighted to find
TOPOLOGY WITHOUT TEARS, an excellent, totally different work in which the
substance is beautifully presented; each definition is made clear with a number of
good examples. Your work stands apart for its lucidity. Now I really enjoy learning
topology. I express my sincere gratitude to you for making topology an interesting
subject for me.”
M.A.R. K., Karachi: “thank you for remembering a third world student”.

21

Helpful Hint on Hyperlinks

If you are using the pdf file of this book on a computer or tablet rather than using
a print copy, you should find the hyperlinks very useful.

Often when you use a

hyperlink to a previous theorem or definition in this book, you will want to return
to the page you were studying. On many pdf readers, including Adobe, this can be
achieved by simultaneously pressing the ALT key and the LEFT ARROW key.

Chapter 1

Topological Spaces
Introduction
Tennis, football, baseball and hockey may all be exciting games but to play them
you must first learn (some of ) the rules of the game. Mathematics is no different.
So we begin with the rules for topology.
This chapter opens with the definition of a topology and is then devoted to
some simple examples: finite topological spaces, discrete spaces, indiscrete spaces,
and spaces with the finite-closed topology.
Topology, like other branches of pure mathematics such as group theory, is an
axiomatic subject. We start with a set of axioms and we use these axioms to prove
propositions and theorems. It is extremely important to develop your skill at writing
proofs.
Why are proofs so important? Suppose our task were to construct a building.
We would start with the foundations. In our case these are the axioms or definitions
– everything else is built upon them. Each theorem or proposition represents a new
level of knowledge and must be firmly anchored to the previous level. We attach the
new level to the previous one using a proof. So the theorems and propositions are
the new heights of knowledge we achieve, while the proofs are essential as they are
the mortar which attaches them to the level below. Without proofs the structure
would collapse.
So what is a mathematical proof ?

24

1.1. TOPOLOGY

25

A mathematical proof is a watertight argument which begins with information
you are given, proceeds by logical argument, and ends with what you are asked to
prove.
You should begin a proof by writing down the information you are given and
then state what you are asked to prove. If the information you are given or what
you are required to prove contains technical terms, then you should write down the
definitions of those technical terms.
Every proof should consist of complete sentences.

Each of these sentences

should be a consequence of (i) what has been stated previously or (ii) a theorem,
proposition or lemma that has already been proved.
In this book you will see many proofs, but note that mathematics is not a
spectator sport. It is a game for participants. The only way to learn to write proofs
is to try to write them yourself.

Definitions.

Let X be a non-empty set. A set

τ of subsets of X is

said to be a topology on X if

The pair (X,

τ belongs to τ .

τ ) is called a topological space.

Example.

Let X = {a, b, c, d, e, f } and

τ 1 = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e, f }}.
Then
1.1.1.

τ 1 is a topology on X as it satisfies conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of Definitions

1.1.3

Let X = {a, b, c, d, e} and

Example.

τ 2 = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, e}, {b, c, d}}.
Then

τ 2 is not a topology on X as the union
{c, d} ∪ {a, c, e} = {a, c, d, e}

of two members of

τ 2 does not belong to τ 2 ; that is, τ 2 does not satisfy condition

(ii) of Definitions 1.1.1.
1.1.4

Let X = {a, b, c, d, e, f } and

Example.

τ 3 = {X, Ø, {a}, {f }, {a, f }, {a, c, f }, {b, c, d, e, f }} .
Then

τ 3 is not a topology on X since the intersection
{a, c, f } ∩ {b, c, d, e, f } = {c, f }

of two sets in

τ 3 does not belong to τ 3 ; that is, τ 3 does not have property (iii) of

Definitions 1.1.1.
1.1.5

Example.

Let N be the set of all natural numbers (that is, the set of all

positive integers) and let

τ 4 consist of N, Ø, and all finite subsets of N. Then τ 4

is not a topology on N, since the infinite union

{2} ∪ {3} ∪ · · · ∪ {n} ∪ · · · = {2, 3, . . . , n, . . . }
of members of

τ 4 does not belong to τ 4 ; that is, τ 4 does not have property (ii)

of Definitions 1.1.1.

Let X be any non-empty set and let

τ be the collection

τ ) is called a discrete space.

τ in Definitions 1.1.6 does satisfy the conditions of Definitions

1.1.1 and so is indeed a topology.
Observe that the set X in Definitions 1.1.6 can be any non-empty set. So
there is an infinite number of discrete spaces – one for each set X .

1.1.7

Definitions.

Let X be any non-empty set and

Once again we have to check that

τ = {X, Ø}. Then τ

τ ) is said to be an indiscrete space.

τ satisfies the conditions of 1.1.1 and so is

indeed a topology.
We observe again that the set X in Definitions 1.1.7 can be any non-empty
set. So there is an infinite number of indiscrete spaces – one for each set X .

In the introduction to this chapter we discussed the
importance of proofs and what is involved in writing
them. Our first experience with proofs is in Example
1.1.8 and Proposition 1.1.9.

You should study these

proofs carefully.

CHAPTER 1. TOPOLOGICAL SPACES

1.1.8

Example.

If X = {a, b, c} and

τ is a topology on X with {a} ∈ τ ,

{b} ∈ τ , and {c} ∈ τ , prove that τ is the discrete topology.
Proof.

τ is a topology and that {a} ∈ τ , {b} ∈ τ , and {c} ∈ τ .
We are required to prove that τ is the discrete topology; that is, we are
required to prove (by Definitions 1.1.6) that τ contains all subsets of X .
Remember that τ is a topology and so satisfies conditions (i), (ii) and (iii)
We are given that

of Definitions 1.1.1.
So we shall begin our proof by writing down all of the subsets of X .
The set X has 3 elements and so it has 23 distinct subsets. They are: S1 = Ø,

S2 = {a}, S3 = {b}, S4 = {c}, S5 = {a, b}, S6 = {a, c}, S7 = {b, c}, and
S8 = {a, b, c} = X .

τ . As τ is a topology,
Definitions 1.1.1 (i) implies that X and Ø are in τ ; that is, S1 ∈ τ and S8 ∈ τ .
We are given that {a} ∈ τ , {b} ∈ τ and {c} ∈ τ ; that is, S2 ∈ τ , S3 ∈ τ and
S4 ∈ τ .
To complete the proof we need to show that S5 ∈ τ , S6 ∈ τ , and S7 ∈ τ . But
S5 = {a, b} = {a} ∪ {b}. As we are given that {a} and {b} are in τ , Definitions
1.1.1 (ii) implies that their union is also in τ ; that is, S5 = {a, b} ∈ τ .
Similarly S6 = {a, c} = {a}∪{c} ∈ τ
and S7 = {b, c} = {b}∪{c} ∈ τ .
We are required to prove that each of these subsets is in

In the introductory comments on this chapter we observed that mathematics
is not a spectator sport.

You should be an active participant.

Of course your

participation includes doing some of the exercises. But more than this is expected
of you. You have to think about the material presented to you.
One of your tasks is to look at the results that we prove and to ask pertinent
questions.

For example, we have just shown that if each of the singleton sets

{a}, {b} and {c} is in τ and X = {a, b, c}, then τ is the discrete topology. You
should ask if this is but one example of a more general phenomenon; that is, if (X, τ )
is any topological space such that

τ contains every singleton set, is τ necessarily

the discrete topology? The answer is “yes”, and this is proved in Proposition 1.1.9.

τ ) is a topological space such that, for every
x ∈ X , the singleton set {x} is in τ , then τ is the discrete topology.
1.1.9

Proposition.

If (X,

Proof.

This result is a generalization of Example 1.1.8. Thus you might expect that
the proof would be similar. However, we cannot list all of the subsets of X
as we did in Example 1.1.8 because X may be an infinite set. Nevertheless
we must prove that every subset of X is in

τ.

At this point you may be tempted to prove the result for some special
cases, for example taking X to consist of 4, 5 or even 100 elements. But this
approach is doomed to failure. Recall our opening comments in this chapter
where we described a mathematical proof as a watertight argument. We
cannot produce a watertight argument by considering a few special cases,
or even a very large number of special cases. The watertight argument
must cover all cases. So we must consider the general case of an arbitrary
non-empty set X . Somehow we must prove that every subset of X is in

τ.

Looking again at the proof of Example 1.1.8 we see that the key is that
every subset of X is a union of singleton subsets of X and we already know
that all of the singleton subsets are in

τ . This is also true in the general

case.

We begin the proof by recording the fact that every set is the union of all its
singleton subsets; that is, if S be any subset of X , then

S=

{x}.

x∈S

τ , Definitions 1.1.1 (ii) and the above equation
imply that S ∈ τ . As S is an arbitrary subset of X , we have that τ is the discrete
Since we are given that each {x} is in
topology.

CHAPTER 1. TOPOLOGICAL SPACES

That every set S is a union of its singleton subsets is a result which we shall
use from time to time throughout the book in many different contexts. Note that
it holds even when S = Ø as then we form what is called an empty union and get

Ø as the result.

1.2

Open Sets, Closed Sets, and Clopen Sets

Rather than continually refer to “members of

τ ", we find it more convenient to give

such sets a name. We call them “open sets”. We shall also name the complements
of open sets. They will be called “closed sets”. This nomenclature is not ideal, but
derives from the so-called “open intervals” and “closed intervals” on the real number
line. We shall have more to say about this in Chapter 2.

1.2. OPEN SETS

1.2.2

Proposition.

33

If (X,

τ ) is any topological space, then

(i) X and Ø are open sets,
(ii) the union of any (finite or infinite) number of open sets is an open set, and
(iii) the intersection of any finite number of open sets is an open set.

Proof.

Clearly (i) and (ii) are trivial consequences of Definition 1.2.1 and

Definitions 1.1.1 (i) and (ii). The condition (iii) follows from Definition 1.2.1 and
Exercises 1.1 #4.
On reading Proposition 1.2.2, a question should have popped into your mind:
while any finite or infinite union of open sets is open, we state only that finite
intersections of open sets are open. Are infinite intersections of open sets always
open? The next example shows that the answer is “no”.

34

CHAPTER 1. TOPOLOGICAL SPACES

1.2.3

Example.

Let N be the set of all positive integers and let

τ consist of

Ø and each subset S of N such that the complement of S in N, N \ S , is a finite set.
It is easily verified that τ satisfies Definitions 1.1.1 and so is a topology on N. (In
the next section we shall discuss this topology further. It is called the finite-closed
topology.) For each natural number n, define the set Sn as follows:

Sn = {1} ∪ {n + 1} ∪ {n + 2} ∪ {n + 3} ∪ · · · = {1} ∪

∞
[

{m}.

m=n+1
Clearly each Sn is an open set in the topology

τ , since its complement is a finite

set. However,
∞
\

Sn = {1}.

(1)

n=1
As the complement of {1} is neither N nor a finite set, {1} is not open. So (1)
shows that the intersection of the open sets Sn is not open.
You might well ask: how did you find the example presented in Example 1.2.3?
The answer is unglamorous! It was by trial and error.
If we tried, for example, a discrete topology, we would find that each intersection
of open sets is indeed open. The same is true of the indiscrete topology. So what
you need to do is some intelligent guesswork.
Remember that to prove that the intersection of open sets is not necessarily
open, you need to find just one counterexample!

1.2.4

Definition.

Let (X,

said to be a closed set in (X,
in (X,

τ ) be a topological space. A subset S of X is

τ ) if its complement in X , namely X \ S , is open

τ ).

In Example 1.1.2, the closed sets are

Ø, X, {b, c, d, e, f }, {a, b, e, f }, {b, e, f } and {a}.

τ ) is a discrete space, then it is obvious that every subset of X is a closed
set. However in an indiscrete space, (X, τ ), the only closed sets are X and Ø.
If (X,

1.2. OPEN SETS

1.2.5

Proposition.

35

If (X,

τ ) is any topological space, then

(i) Ø and X are closed sets,
(ii) the intersection of any (finite or infinite) number of closed sets is a closed
set and
(iii) the union of any finite number of closed sets is a closed set.

Proof.

(i) follows immediately from Proposition 1.2.2 (i) and Definition 1.2.4, as

the complement of X is Ø and the complement of Ø is X .
To prove that (iii) is true, let S1 , S2 , . . . , Sn be closed sets. We are required to
prove that S1 ∪ S2 ∪ · · · ∪ Sn is a closed set. It suffices to show, by Definition 1.2.4,
that X \ (S1 ∪ S2 ∪ · · · ∪ Sn ) is an open set.
As S1 , S2 , . . . , Sn are closed sets, their complements X \ S1 , X \ S2 , . . . , X \ Sn
are open sets. But

X \ (S1 ∪ S2 ∪ · · · ∪ Sn ) = (X \ S1 ) ∩ (X \ S2 ) ∩ · · · ∩ (X \ Sn ).

(1)

As the right hand side of (1) is a finite intersection of open sets, it is an open
set. So the left hand side of (1) is an open set. Hence S1 ∪ S2 ∪ · · · ∪ Sn is a closed
set, as required. So (iii) is true.
The proof of (ii) is similar to that of (iii). [However, you should read the warning
in the proof of Example 1.3.9.]

36

CHAPTER 1. TOPOLOGICAL SPACES

Warning.

The names “open” and “closed” often lead newcomers to the world

of topology into error. Despite the names, some open sets are also closed sets!
Moreover, some sets are neither open sets nor closed sets! Indeed, if we consider
Example 1.1.2 we see that
(i) the set {a} is both open and closed;
(ii) the set {b, c} is neither open nor closed;
(iii) the set {c, d} is open but not closed;
(iv) the set {a, b, e, f } is closed but not open.
In a discrete space every set is both open and closed, while in an indiscrete space

(X, τ ), all subsets of X except X and Ø are neither open nor closed.
To remind you that sets can be both open and closed we introduce the following
definition.

Distinct Topologies on Finite and Infinite Sets
7.

(i) As recorded in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_topological_space, the
number of distinct topologies on a set with n ∈ N points can be very large
even for small n; namely when n = 2, there are 4 topologies; when n = 3,
there are 29 topologies: when n = 4, there are 355 topologies; when n = 5,
there are 6942 topologies etc. Using mathematical induction, prove that as

n increases, the number of topologies increases.
[Hint. It suffices to show that if a set with n points has M distinct topologies,
then a set with n + 1 points has at least M + 1 topologies.]
(ii) Using mathematical induction prove that if the finite set X has n ∈ N points,

The Finite-Closed Topology

It is usual to define a topology on a set by stating which sets are open. However,
sometimes it is more natural to describe the topology by saying which sets are closed.
The next definition provides one such example.

1.3.1

Definition.

Let X be any non-empty set. A topology

τ on X is

called the finite-closed topology or the cofinite topology if the closed subsets
of X are X and all finite subsets of X ; that is, the open sets are Ø and all subsets
of X which have finite complements.

Once again it is necessary to check that

τ in Definition 1.3.1 is indeed a

topology; that is, that it satisfies each of the conditions of Definitions 1.1.1.
Note that Definition 1.3.1 does not say that every topology which has X and
the finite subsets of X closed is the finite-closed topology. These must be the only
closed sets. [Of course, in the discrete topology on any set X , the set X and all
finite subsets of X are indeed closed, but so too are all other subsets of X .]
In the finite-closed topology all finite sets are closed. However, the following
example shows that infinite subsets need not be open sets.

1.3.2

Example.

If N is the set of all positive integers, then sets such as {1},

{5, 6, 7}, {2, 4, 6, 8} are finite and hence closed in the finite-closed topology. Thus
their complements

{2, 3, 4, 5, . . .}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, . . .}, {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, . . .}
are open sets in the finite-closed topology. On the other hand, the set of even
positive integers is not a closed set since it is not finite and hence its complement,
the set of odd positive integers, is not an open set in the finite-closed topology.
So while all finite sets are closed, not all infinite sets are open.

40

CHAPTER 1. TOPOLOGICAL SPACES

1.3.3

Example.

Let

τ be the finite-closed topology on a set X . If X has at

least 3 distinct clopen subsets, prove that X is a finite set.
Proof.

We are given that

τ is the finite-closed topology, and that there are at least

3 distinct clopen subsets.
We are required to prove that X is a finite set.
Recall that

τ is the finite-closed topology means that the family of all

closed sets consists of X and all finite subsets of X . Recall also that a set
is clopen if and only if it is both closed and open.
Remember that in every topological space there are at least 2 clopen
sets, namely X and Ø. (See the comment immediately following Definition
1.2.6.) But we are told that in the space (X,

τ ) there are at least 3 clopen

subsets. This implies that there is a clopen subset other than Ø and X . So
we shall have a careful look at this other clopen set!

τ ) has 3 distinct clopen subsets, we know that there is a clopen
subset S of X such that S 6= X and S 6= Ø. As S is open in (X, τ ), Definition 1.2.4
As our space (X,

implies that its complement X \ S is a closed set.
Thus S and X \ S are closed in the finite-closed topology

τ . Therefore S and

X \ S are both finite, since neither equals X . But X = S ∪ (X \ S) and so X is the
union of two finite sets. Thus X is a finite set, as required.
We now know three distinct topologies we can put on any infinite set – and
there are many more. The three we know are the discrete topology, the indiscrete
topology, and the finite-closed topology. So we must be careful always to specify
the topology on a set.
For example, the set {n : n ⩾ 10} is open in the finite-closed topology on the
set of natural numbers, but is not open in the indiscrete topology. The set of odd
natural numbers is open in the discrete topology on the set of natural numbers, but
is not open in the finite-closed topology.

1.3. FINITE-CLOSED TOPOLOGY

41

We shall now record some definitions which you have probably met before.
1.3.4

Definitions.

Let f be a function from a set X into a set Y .

(i) The function f is said to be one-to-one or injective if f (x1 ) = f (x2 )
implies x1 = x2 , for x1 , x2 ∈ X;
(ii) The function f is said to be onto or surjective if for each y ∈ Y there
exists an x ∈ X such that f (x) = y ;
(iii) The function f is said to be bijective if it is both one-to-one and onto.

1.3.5

Definitions.

Let f be a function from a set X into a set Y . The

function f is said to have an inverse if there exists a function g of Y into X
such that g(f (x)) = x, for all x ∈ X and f (g(y)) = y , for all y ∈ Y . The
function g is called an inverse function of f .

The proof of the following proposition is left as an exercise for you.
1.3.6

Proposition.

Let f be a function from a set X into a set Y .

(i) The function f has an inverse if and only if f is bijective.
(ii) Let g1 and g2 be functions from Y into X . If g1 and g2 are both inverse
functions of f , then g1 = g2 ; that is, g1 (y) = g2 (y), for all y ∈ Y .
(iii) Let g be a function from Y into X . Then g is an inverse function of f if
and only if f is an inverse function of g .

Warning.

It is a very common error for students to think that a function is one-

to-one if “it maps one point to one point”.
All functions map one point to one point. Indeed this is part of the definition
of a function.
A one-to-one function is a function that maps different points to different
points.

42

CHAPTER 1. TOPOLOGICAL SPACES

We now turn to a very important notion that you may not have met before.

Let f be a function from a set X into a set Y . If S is
any subset of Y , then the set f −1 (S) is defined by

1.3.7

Definition.

f −1 (S) = {x : x ∈ X and f (x) ∈ S}.
The subset f −1 (S) of X is said to be the inverse image of S .
Note that an inverse function of f : X → Y exists if and only if f is bijective.
But the inverse image of any subset of Y exists even if f is neither one-to-one nor
onto. The next example demonstrates this.
1.3.8

Example.

Let f be the function from the set of integers, Z, into itself

given by f (z) = |z|, for each z ∈ Z.
The function f is not one-to one, since f (1) = f (−1).
It is also not onto, since there is no z ∈ Z, such that f (z) = −1. So f is
certainly not bijective. Hence, by Proposition 1.3.6 (i), f does not have an inverse
function. However inverse images certainly exist. For example,

f −1 ({1, 2, 3}) = {−1, −2, −3, 1, 2, 3}
f −1 ({−5, 3, 5, 7, 9}) = {−3, −5, −7, −9, 3, 5, 7, 9}.



We conclude this section with an interesting example.

τ ) be a topological space and X a non-empty set.
Further, let f be a function from X into Y . Put τ 1 = {f −1 (S) : S ∈ τ }. Prove
that τ 1 is a topology on X .

1.3.9

Example.

Let (Y,

Proof.

Our task is to show that the collection of sets,
that is, we have to show that

Therefore

X ∈ τ1

since

X = f −1 (Y )

and

Y ∈ τ.

Ø ∈ τ1

since

Ø = f −1 (Ø)

and

Ø ∈ τ.

τ 1 has property (i) of Definitions 1.1.1.

To verify condition (ii) of Definitions 1.1.1, let {Aj : j ∈ J} be a collection

τ 1 , for some index set J . We have to show that j∈J Aj ∈ τ 1.
As Aj ∈ τ 1 , the definition of τ 1 implies that Aj = f −1 (Bj ), where Bj ∈ τ .

You are reminded that not all sets are countable. (See the Appendix

to assume that sets A1 , A2 . . . . , An , . . . are in

τ 1 and show that their union

A1 ∪ A2 ∪ . . . ∪ An ∪ . . . is in τ 1 . This would prove only that the union of a
countable number of sets in

τ 1 lies in τ 1, but would not show that τ 1 has property

(ii) of Definitions 1.1.1– this property requires all unions, whether countable or

τ 1 to be in τ 1.]
Finally, let A1 and A2 be in τ 1 . We have to show that A1 ∩ A2 ∈ τ 1 .

T0 -spaces as defined in Exercises 1.3 #5. Indeed that same Wikipedia source
says, that if n = 3, there are 19 distinct T0 -spaces; for n = 4, there are 219
distinct T0 -spaces; for n = 5, there are 4231 distinct T0 -spaces. Prove, using
mathematical induction, that as n increases, the number of T0 -spaces increases.

there are at least M + 1 T0 -spaces with n + 1 points.]

Postscript

In this chapter we introduced the fundamental notion of a topological space. As
examples we saw various finite topological spaces3 , as well as discrete spaces,
indiscrete spaces and spaces with the finite-closed topology. None of these is a
particularly important example as far as applications are concerned. However, in
Exercises 4.3 #8, it is noted that every infinite topological space “contains” an
infinite topological space with one of the five topologies: the indiscrete topology,
the discrete topology, the finite-closed topology, the initial segment topology, or the
final segment topology of Exercises 1.1 #6. In the next chapter we describe the
very important euclidean topology.
3

By a finite topological space we mean a topological space (X,

τ ) where the set X is finite.

CHAPTER 1. TOPOLOGICAL SPACES

En route we met the terms “open set” and “closed set” and we were warned
that these names can be misleading. Sets can be both open and closed, neither
open nor closed, open but not closed, or closed but not open. It is important to
remember that we cannot prove that a set is open by proving that it is not closed.
Other than the definitions of topology, topological space, open set, and closed
set the most significant topic covered was that of writing proofs .
In the opening comments of this chapter we pointed out the importance of
learning to write proofs. In Example 1.1.8, Proposition 1.1.9, and Example 1.3.3
we have seen how to “think through” a proof. It is essential that you develop your
own skill at writing proofs. Good exercises to try for this purpose include Exercises
1.1 #8, Exercises 1.2 #2,4, and Exercises 1.3 #1,4.

If you have not already done so, you should watch the
first two of the YouTube videos on proofs. They are

Some students are confused by the notion of topology as it involves “sets of
sets”. To check your understanding, do Exercises 1.1 #3.
The exercises included the notions of T0 -space and T1 -space which will be
formally introduced later. These are known as separation properties.
Finally we emphasize the importance of inverse images. These are dealt with in
Example 1.3.9 and Exercises 1.3 #1. Our definition of continuous mapping will rely
on inverse images.

Chapter 2

The Euclidean Topology
Introduction
In a movie or a novel there are usually a few central characters about whom the
plot revolves. In the story of topology, the euclidean topology on the set of real
numbers is one of the central characters. Indeed it is such a rich example that we
shall frequently return to it for inspiration and further examination.
Let R denote the set of all real numbers.

In Chapter 1 we defined three

topologies that can be put on any set: the discrete topology, the indiscrete topology
and the finite-closed topology. So we know three topologies that can be put on the
set R. Six other topologies on R were defined in Exercises 1.1 #5 and #9. In this
chapter we describe a much more important and interesting topology on R which is
known as the euclidean topology.
An analysis of the euclidean topology leads us to the notion of “basis for a
topology”. In the study of Linear Algebra we learn that every vector space has a
basis and every vector is a linear combination of members of the basis. Similarly, in
a topological space every open set can be expressed as a union of members of the
basis. Indeed, a set is open if and only if it is a union of members of the basis.
In order to understand this chapter, you should familiarize yourself with the
content of the first section of Appendix 1; that is A1.1. This is supplemented by the
videos "Topology Without Tears - Video 2a & 2b - Infinite Set Theory" which are

The Euclidean Topology on R

2.1.1

Definition.

A subset S of R is said to be open in the euclidean

topology on R if it has the following property:
For each x ∈ S, there exist a, b in R, with a < b, such that x ∈ (a, b) ⊆ S.

(∗)

Notation.

Whenever we refer to the topological space R without specifying the

topology, we mean R with the euclidean topology.
2.1.2

Remarks.

(i)

The “euclidean topology”

τ is a topology.

Proof.
We are required to show that

τ satisfies conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) of

Definitions 1.1.1.
We are given that a set is in

τ if and only if it has property (∗).

τ . Let x ∈ R. If we put a = x − 1 and b = x + 1,
then x ∈ (a, b) ⊆ R; that is, R has property (∗) and so R ∈ τ . Secondly, Ø ∈ τ as
Firstly, we show that R ∈

Ø has property (∗) by default.
Now let {Aj : j ∈ J}, for some index set J , be a family of members of

τ . Then

S
S
we have to show that j∈J Aj ∈ τ ; that is, we have to show that j∈J Aj has
S
property (∗). Let x ∈ j∈J Aj . Then x ∈ Ak , for some k ∈ J . As Ak ∈ τ , there
S
exist a and b in R with a < b such that x ∈ (a, b) ⊆ Ak . As k ∈ J , Ak ⊆ j∈J Aj
S
S
and so x ∈ (a, b) ⊆ j∈J Aj . Hence j∈J Aj has property (∗) and thus is in τ , as
required.

τ . We have to prove that A1 ∩ A2 ∈ τ . So let
y ∈ A1 ∩ A2 . Then y ∈ A1 . As A1 ∈ τ , there exist a and b in R with a < b such
that y ∈ (a, b) ⊆ A1 . Also y ∈ A2 ∈ τ . So there exist c and d in R with c < d such
Finally, let A1 and A2 be in

that y ∈ (c, d) ⊆ A2 . Let e be the greater of a and c, and f the smaller of b and

d. It is easily checked that e < y < f, and so y ∈ (e, f ). As (e, f ) ⊆ (a, b) ⊆ A1
and (e, f ) ⊆ (c, d) ⊆ A2 , we deduce that y ∈ (e, f ) ⊆ A1 ∩ A2 . Hence A1 ∩ A2 has
property (∗) and so is in τ .
Thus

τ is indeed a topology on R.



52

CHAPTER 2. THE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY

We now proceed to describe the open sets and the closed sets in the euclidean
topology on R. In particular, we shall see that all open intervals are indeed open
sets in this topology and all closed intervals are closed sets.
(ii)

Let r, s ∈ R with r < s. In the euclidean topology

interval (r, s) does indeed belong to

τ on R, the open

τ and so is an open set.

Proof.
We are given the open interval (r, s).
We must show that (r, s) is open in the euclidean topology; that is, we
have to show that (r, s) has property (∗) of Definition 2.1.1.
So we shall begin by letting x ∈ (r, s). We want to find a and b in R with

a < b such that x ∈ (a, b) ⊆ (r, s).
Let x ∈ (r, s). Choose a = r and b = s. Then clearly

x ∈ (a, b) ⊆ (r, s).
So (r, s) is an open set in the euclidean topology.
(iii)



The open intervals (r, ∞) and (−∞, r) are open sets in R, for every real

number r .
Proof.
Firstly, we shall show that (r, ∞) is an open set; that is, that it has property
(∗).
To show this we let x ∈ (r, ∞) and seek a, b ∈ R such that

x ∈ (a, b) ⊆ (r, ∞).

Let x ∈ (r, ∞). Put a = r and b = x + 1. Then x ∈ (a, b) ⊆ (r, ∞) and so

(r, ∞) ∈ τ .
A similar argument shows that (−∞, r) is an open set in R.



2.1. EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY

(iv)

53

It is important to note that while every open interval is an open set in

R, the converse is false. Not all open sets in R are intervals. For example, the
set (1, 3) ∪ (5, 6) is an open set in R, but it is not an open interval. Even the set
S∞

n=1 (2n, 2n + 1) is an open set in R.
For each c and d in R with c < d, the closed interval [c, d] is not an open
set in R.1
(v)

Proof.
We have to show that [c, d] does not have property (∗).
To do this it suffices to find any one x such that there is no a, b having
property (∗).
Obviously c and d are very special points in the interval [c, d]. So we shall
choose x = c and show that no a, b with the required property exist.
We use the method of proof called Proof by Contradiction.

We

suppose that a and b exist with the required property and show that this
leads to a contradiction, that is something which is false.
Consequently the supposition is false !

Hence no such a and b exist.

Thus [c, d] does not have property (∗) and so is not an open set.

Observe that c ∈ [c, d]. Suppose there exist a and b in R with a < b such that
c ∈ (a, b) ⊆ [c, d]. Then c ∈ (a, b) implies a < c < b and so a < c+a
2 < c < b. Thus
c+a ∈ (a, b) and c+a ∈
2
2 / [c, d]. Hence (a, b) 6⊆ [c, d], which is a contradiction. So there
do not exist a and b such that c ∈ (a, b) ⊆ [c, d]. Hence [c, d] does not have property
(∗) and so [c, d] ∈
/
(vi)

τ.



For each a and b in R with a < b, the closed interval [a, b] is a closed set

in the euclidean topology on R.
Proof.

To see that it is closed we have to observe only that its complement

(−∞, a) ∪ (b, ∞), being the union of two open sets, is an open set.

Mathematics” which discusses Proof by Contradiction. See http://youtu.be/T4384JAS3L4.

54

CHAPTER 2. THE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY

(vii)
Proof.

Each singleton set {a} is closed in R.
The complement of {a} is the union of the two open sets (−∞, a) and

(a, ∞) and so is open. Therefore {a} is closed in R, as required.
[In the terminology of Exercises 1.3 #3, this result says that R is a T1 -space.]
(viii)

Note that we could have included (vii) in (vi) simply by replacing “a < b”

by “a ⩽ b”. The singleton set {a} is just the degenerate case of the closed interval

[a, b].



(ix)

The set Z of all integers is a closed subset of R.

S∞

n=−∞ (n, n + 1) of open subsets
(n, n + 1) of R and so is open in R. Therefore Z is closed in R.

Proof.

(x)

The complement of Z is the union

The set Q of all rational numbers is neither a closed subset of R nor an

open subset of R.
Proof.
We shall show that Q is not an open set by proving that it does not have
property (∗).
To do this it suffices to show that Q does not contain any interval (a, b),
with a < b.
Suppose that (a, b) ⊆ Q, where a and b are in R with a < b. Between any two
distinct real numbers there is an irrational number. (Can you prove this?) Therefore
there exists c ∈ (a, b) such that c ∈
/ Q. This contradicts (a, b) ⊆ Q. Hence Q does
not contain any interval (a, b), and so is not an open set.
To prove that Q is not a closed set it suffices to show that R \ Q is not an open
set. Using the fact that between any two distinct real numbers there is a rational
number we see that R \ Q does not contain any interval (a, b) with a < b. So R \ Q
is not open in R and hence Q is not closed in R.

In Chapter 3 we shall prove that the only clopen subsets of R are the

trivial ones, namely R and Ø.

56

CHAPTER 2. THE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY

2.2

Basis for a Topology

Remarks 2.1.2 allow us to describe the euclidean topology on R in a much more
convenient manner. To do this, we introduce the notion of a basis for a topology.
2.2.1

Proposition.

A subset S of R is open if and only if it is a union of

open intervals.
Proof.
We are required to prove that S is open if and only if it is a union of open
intervals; that is, we have to show that
(i) if S is a union of open intervals, then it is an open set, and
(ii) if S is an open set, then it is a union of open intervals.
Assume that S is a union of open intervals; that is, there exist open intervals

S
(aj , bj ), where j belongs to some index set J , such that S = j∈J (aj , bj ). By
Remarks 2.1.2 (ii) each open interval (aj , bj ) is an open set. Thus S is a union of
open sets and so S is an open set.
Conversely, assume that S is open in R. Then for each x ∈ S , there exists an
interval Ix = (a, b) such that x ∈ Ix ⊆ S. We now claim that S =
We are required to show that the two sets S and

S

S

x∈S Ix .

x∈S Ix are equal.

These sets are shown to be equal by proving that
(i) if y ∈ S , then y ∈
(ii) if z ∈

S

S

x∈S Ix , and

x∈S Ix , then z ∈ S .

[Note that (i) is equivalent to the statement S ⊆
equivalent to

S

x∈S Ix , while (ii) is

x∈S Ix ⊆ S .]

Firstly let y ∈ S. Then y ∈ Iy . So y ∈

S

S

S

x∈S Ix , as required. Secondly, let
x∈S Ix . Then z ∈ It , for some t ∈ S. As each Ix ⊆ S , we see that It ⊆ S and

z∈
S
so z ∈ S. Hence S = x∈S Ix , and we have that S is a union of open intervals, as
required.

2.2. BASIS FOR A TOPOLOGY

57

The above proposition tells us that in order to describe the topology of R it
suffices to say that all intervals (a, b) are open sets. Every other open set is a union
of these open sets. This leads us to the following definition.

τ ) be a topological space. A collection B of
open subsets of X is said to be a basis for the topology τ if every open set is

Let (X,

Definition.

a union of members of B.

τ on a set X then a subset U of X is in τ if
and only if it is a union of members of B . So B “generates” the topology τ in the
If B is a basis for a topology

following sense: if we are told what sets are members of B then we can determine
the members of

2.2.3

τ – they are just all the sets which are unions of members of B.

Example.

Let B = {(a, b) : a, b ∈ R, a < b}. Then B is a basis for the



euclidean topology on R, by Proposition 2.2.1.

2.2.4

Example.

Let (X,

τ ) be a discrete space and B the family of all singleton

subsets of X ; that is, B = {{x} : x ∈ X}. Then, by Proposition 1.1.9, B is a basis
for

τ.

2.2.5



Example.

Let X = {a, b, c, d, e, f } and

τ 1 = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e, f }}.
Then B = {{a}, {c, d}, {b, c, d, e, f }} is a basis for
of

τ 1 as B ⊆ τ 1 and every member

τ 1 can be expressed as a union of members of B. (Observe that Ø is an empty

union of members of B .)
Note that

τ 1 itself is also a basis for τ 1.



58

CHAPTER 2. THE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY

2.2.6

Remark.

Observe that if (X,

basis for the topology

τ ) is a topological space then B = τ is a

τ . So, for example, the set of all subsets of X is a basis for

the discrete topology on X .
We see, therefore, that there can be many different bases for the same topology.

τ on a set X and B1 is a collection of subsets
of X such that B ⊆ B1 ⊆ τ , then B1 is also a basis for τ . [Verify this.]


Indeed if B is a basis for a topology

As indicated above the notion of “basis for a topology” allows us to define
topologies. However the following example shows that we must be careful.

2.2.7

Example.

Let X = {a, b, c} and B = {{a}, {c}, {a, b}, {b, c}}. Then B is

not a basis for any topology on X . To see this, suppose that B is a basis for a
topology

τ . Then τ consists of all unions of sets in B; that is,
τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c}, {a, c}, {a, b}, {b, c}}.

(Once again we use the fact that Ø is an empty union of members of B and so

Ø ∈ τ .)
However,
so

τ is not a topology since the set {b} = {a, b} ∩ {b, c} is not in τ and

τ does not have property (iii) of Definitions 1.1.1. This is a contradiction, and

so our supposition is false. Thus B is not a basis for any topology on X .



Thus we are led to ask: if B is a collection of subsets of X , under what conditions
is B a basis for a topology? This question is answered by Proposition 2.2.8.

2.2. BASIS FOR A TOPOLOGY

2.2.8

59

Let X be a non-empty set and let B be a collection of

subsets of X . Then B is a basis for a topology on X if and only if B has the
following properties:

S

(a) X =

B , and

B∈B
(b) for any B1 , B2 ∈ B , the set B1 ∩ B2 is a union of members of B.
Proof.

If B is a basis for a topology

τ then τ must have the properties (i),

(ii), and (iii) of Definitions 1.1.1. In particular X must be an open set and the
intersection of any two open sets must be an open set. As the open sets are just
the unions of members of B , this implies that (a) and (b) above are true.

τ be the collection
of all subsets of X which are unions of members of B . We shall show that τ is
a topology on X . (If so then B is obviously a basis for this topology τ and the
Conversely, assume that B has properties (a) and (b) and let

proposition is true.)
By (a), X =

S

of B and so Ø ∈

τ

τ

B∈B B and so X ∈ . Note that Ø is an empty union of members
. So we see that
does have property (i) of Definitions 1.1.1.

τ . Then each Tj is a union of members
of B . Hence the union of all the Tj is also a union of members of B and so is in τ .

You should verify that the two expressions for C ∩ D are indeed equal!

By our assumption (b), each Bk ∩ Bj is a union of members of B and so C ∩ D
is a union of members of B . Thus C ∩ D ∈

τ is indeed a topology, and B is a basis for this topology, as required.

CHAPTER 2. THE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY

Proposition 2.2.8 is a very useful result. It allows us to define topologies by
simply writing down a basis. This is often easier than trying to describe all of the
open sets.
We shall now use this Proposition to define a topology on the plane.

This

topology is known as the “euclidean topology”.
2.2.9

Example.

Let B be the collection of all “open rectangles”

{hx, yi : hx, yi ∈ R2 , a < x < b, c < y < d} in the plane which have each side
parallel to the X - or Y -axis.

Then B is a basis for a topology on the plane. This topology is called the euclidean
topology.
Whenever we use the symbol R2 we mean the plane, and if we refer to R2 as a
topological space without explicitly saying what the topology is, we mean the plane
with the euclidean topology.
To see that B is indeed a basis for a topology, observe that (i) the plane is the
union of all of the open rectangles, and (ii) the intersection of any two rectangles is
a rectangle. [By “rectangle” we mean one with sides parallel to the axes.] So the
conditions of Proposition 2.2.8 are satisfied and hence B is a basis for a topology.

2.2.10

Remark.

By generalizing Example 2.2.9 we see how to put a topology

Rn = {hx1 , x2 , . . . , xn i : xi ∈ R, i = 1, . . . , n}, for each integer n > 2. We
let B be the collection of all subsets {hx1 , x2 , . . . , xn i ∈ Rn : ai < xi < bi , i =
1, 2, . . . , n} of Rn with sides parallel to the axes. This collection B is a basis for
the euclidean topology on Rn .

2.3

Basis for a Given Topology

Proposition 2.2.8 told us under what conditions a collection B of subsets of a set X
is a basis for some topology on X . However sometimes we are given a topology

τ on X and we want to know whether B is a basis for this specific topology τ .
To verify that B is a basis for τ we could simply apply Definition 2.2.2 and show
that every member of τ is a union of members of B . However, Proposition 2.3.2
provides us with an alternative method.
But first we present an example which shows that there is a difference between
saying that a collection B of subsets of X is a basis for some topology, and saying
that it is a basis for a given topology.

2.3.1

Example.

Let B be the collection of all half-open intervals of the form

(a, b], a < b, where (a, b] = {x : x ∈ R, a < x ⩽ b}. Then B is a basis for a topology
on R, since R is the union of all members of B and the intersection of any two
half-open intervals is a half-open interval.

τ 1 which has B as its basis, is not the euclidean topology
on R. We can see this by observing that (a, b] is an open set in R with topology τ 1 ,
However, the topology

while (a, b] is not an open set in R with the euclidean topology. (See Exercises 2.1
#1.) So B is a basis for some topology but not a basis for the euclidean topology
on R.

2.3.2

Proposition.

Let (X,

subsets of X is a basis for

τ ) be a topological space. A family B of open

τ if and only if for any point x belonging to any open

set U , there is a B ∈ B such that x ∈ B ⊆ U.

Proof.

We are required to prove that
(i) if B is a basis for

τ and x ∈ U ∈ τ , then there exists a B ∈ B such that

x ∈ B ⊆ U,
and

τ and x ∈ U there exists a B ∈ B such that x ∈ B ⊆ U ,
then B is a basis for τ .
(ii) if for each U ∈

Assume B is a basis for

τ and x ∈ U ∈ τS. As B is a basis for τ , the open set

U is a union of members of B ; that is, U = j∈J Bj , where Bj ∈ B , for each j in
some index set J . But x ∈ U implies x ∈ Bj , for some j ∈ J . Thus x ∈ Bj ⊆ U ,
as required.
Conversely, assume that for each U ∈

τ and each x ∈ U , there exists a B ∈ B

with x ∈ B ⊆ U . We have to show that every open set is a union of members of

B . So let V be any open set. Then for each x ∈ V , there is a Bx ∈ B such that
S
x ∈ Bx ⊆ V . Clearly V = x∈V Bx . (Check this!) Thus V is a union of members
of B .


2.3.3

Proposition.

Let B be a basis for a topology

τ on a set X . Then

a subset U of X is open if and only if for each x ∈ U there exists a B ∈ B such
that x ∈ B ⊆ U .

Proof.

Let U be any subset of X . Assume that for each x ∈ U , there exists a

Bx ∈ B such that x ∈ Bx ⊆ U . Clearly U =

S

x∈U Bx . So U is a union of open sets
and hence is open, as required. The converse statement follows from Proposition
2.3.2.



2.3. BASIS FOR A GIVEN TOPOLOGY

65

Observe that the basis property described in Proposition 2.3.3 is precisely what
we used in defining the euclidean topology on R. We said that a subset U of R is
open if and only if for each x ∈ U , there exist a and b in R with a < b, such that

x ∈ (a, b) ⊆ U.
Warning.

Make sure that you understand the difference between Proposition 2.2.8

and Proposition 2.3.2. Proposition 2.2.8 gives conditions for a family B of subsets
of a set X to be a basis for some topology on X . However, Proposition 2.3.2 gives
conditions for a family B of subsets of a topological space (X,
the given topology

τ ) to be a basis for

τ.

We have seen that a topology can have many different bases.

The next

proposition tells us when two bases B1 and B2 on the set X define the same topology.
2.3.4

Proposition.

Let B1 and B2 be bases for topologies

respectively, on a non-empty set X . Then

τ 1 and τ 2,

τ 1 = τ 2 if and only if

(i) for each B ∈ B1 and each x ∈ B , there exists a B

∈ B2 such that

x ∈ B ⊆ B , and
(ii) for each B ∈ B2 and each x ∈ B , there exists a B

0

∈ B1 such that

x ∈ B ⊆ B.
Proof.
We are required to show that B1 and B2 are bases for the same topology
if and only if (i) and (ii) are true.
Firstly we assume that they are bases for the same topology, that is

τ 1 = τ 2, and show that conditions (i) and (ii) hold.
Next we assume that (i) and (ii) hold and show that
Firstly, assume that

τ 1 = τ 2.

τ 1 = τ 2. Then (i) and (ii) are immediate consequences of

Proposition 2.3.2.
Conversely, assume that B1 and B2 satisfy the conditions (i) and (ii).

By

τ 2); that is, B1 ⊆ τ 2.
As every member of τ 1 is a union of members of τ 2 this implies τ 1 ⊆ τ 2 . Similarly
(ii) implies τ 2 ⊆ τ 1 . Hence τ 1 = τ 2 , as required.

Proposition 2.3.2, (i) implies that each B ∈ B1 is open in (X,

Outline Proof.

(We give here only a pictorial argument. It is left to you to write

a detailed proof.)

We are required to show that B is a basis for the euclidean topology.
We shall apply Proposition 2.3.4, but first we need to show that B is a
basis for some topology on R2 .
To do this we show that B satisfies the conditions of Proposition 2.2.8.

The first thing we observe is that B is a basis for some topology because it
satisfies the conditions of Proposition 2.2.8. (To see that B satisfies Proposition
2.2.8, observe that R2 equals the union of all open equilateral triangles with base
parallel to the X-axis, and that the intersection of two such triangles is another such
triangle.)
Next we shall show that the conditions (i) and (ii) of Proposition 2.3.4 are
satisfied.
Firstly we verify condition (i). Let R be an open rectangle with sides parallel to
the axes and any x any point in R. We have to show that there is an open equilateral
triangle T with base parallel to the X -axis such that x ∈ T ⊆ R. Pictorially this is
easy to see.

Finally we verify condition (ii) of Proposition 2.3.4. Let T 0 be an open equilateral
triangle with base parallel to the X -axis and let y be any point in T 0 . Then there
exists an open rectangle R0 such that y ∈ R0 ⊆ T 0 . Pictorially, this is again easy to
see.

So the conditions of Proposition 2.3.4 are satisfied. Thus B is indeed a basis
for the euclidean topology on R2 .

In Example 2.2.9 we defined a basis for the euclidean topology to be the
collection of all “open rectangles” (with sides parallel to the axes). Example 2.3.5
shows that “open rectangles” can be replaced by “open equilateral triangles” (with
base parallel to the X -axis) without changing the topology. In Exercises 2.3 #1
we see that the conditions above in brackets can be dropped without changing the
topology. Also “open rectangles” can be replaced by “open discs”2 .

In fact, most books describe the euclidean topology on R2 in terms of open discs.

CHAPTER 2. THE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY

2.4

Postscript

In this chapter we have defined a very important topological space – R, the set
of all real numbers with the euclidean topology, and spent some time analyzing it.
We observed that, in this topology, open intervals are indeed open sets (and closed
intervals are closed sets). However, not all open sets are open intervals. Nevertheless,
every open set in R is a union of open intervals. This led us to introduce the notion
of “basis for a topology” and to establish that the collection of all open intervals is
a basis for the euclidean topology on R.
In the introduction to Chapter 1 we described a mathematical proof as a
watertight argument and underlined the importance of writing proofs. In this chapter
we were introduced to proof by contradiction in Remarks 2.1.2 (v) with another
example in Example 2.2.7. Proving “necessary and sufficient” conditions, that is, “if
and only if ” conditions, was explained in Proposition 2.2.1, with further examples in
Propositions 2.2.8, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, and 2.3.4.
Bases for topologies is a significant topic in its own right. We saw, for example,
that the collection of all singletons is a basis for the discrete topology. Proposition
2.2.8 gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a collection of subsets of a set X
to be a basis for some topology on X . This was contrasted with Proposition 2.3.2
which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a collection of subsets of X to
be a basis for the given topology on X . It was noted that two different collections

B1 and B2 can be bases for the same topology. Necessary and sufficient conditions
for this are given by Proposition 2.3.4.
We defined the euclidean topology on Rn , for n any positive integer. We saw
that the family of all open discs is a basis for R2 , as is the family of all open squares,
or the family of all open rectangles.
The exercises introduced three interesting ideas. Exercises 2.1 #8 covered the
notions of Fσ -set and Gδ -set which are important in measure theory.

Exercises

2.3 #4 introduced the space of continuous real-valued functions. Such spaces are
called function spaces which are the central objects of study in functional analysis.
Functional analysis is a blend of (classical) analysis and topology, and was for some
time called modern analysis, cf. Simmons [362]. Finally, Exercises 2.3 #5–12 dealt
with the notion of subbasis.

Limit Points

Introduction

On the real number line we have a notion of “closeness”. For example each point
in the sequence .1, .01, .001, .0001, .00001, . . . is closer to 0 than the previous one.
Indeed, in some sense, 0 is a limit point of this sequence. So the interval (0, 1] is not
closed, as it does not contain the limit point 0. In a general topological space we do
not have a “distance function”, so we must proceed differently. We shall define the
notion of limit point without resorting to distances. Even with our new definition
of limit point, the point 0 will still be a limit point of (0, 1] . The introduction of
the notion of limit point will lead us to a much better understanding of the notion
of closed set.
Another very important topological concept we shall introduce in this chapter is
that of connectedness. Consider the topological space R. While the sets [0, 1]∪[2, 3]
and [4, 6] could both be described as having length 2, it is clear that they are different
types of sets . . . the first consists of two disjoint pieces and the second of just one
piece. The difference between the two is “topological” and will be exposed using
the notion of connectedness.

Limit Points and Closure

If (X,

τ ) is a topological space then it is usual to refer to the elements of the set

X as points.
3.1.1

Definition.

Let A be a subset of a topological space (X,

τ ). A point

x ∈ X is said to be a limit point (or accumulation point or cluster point) of
A if every open set, U , containing x contains a point of A different from x.

74

CHAPTER 3. LIMIT POINTS

3.1.2

Example.

Consider the topological space (X,

τ ) where the set X =

{a, b, c, d, e}, the topology τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e}}, and A =
{a, b, c}. Then b, d, and e are limit points of A but a and c are not limit points of
A.
Proof.
The point a is a limit point of A if and only if every open set containing a
contains another point of the set A.
So to show that a is not a limit point of A, it suffices to find even one
open set which contains a but contains no other point of A.
The set {a} is open and contains no other point of A. So a is not a limit point
of A.
The set {c, d} is an open set containing c but no other point of A. So c is not
a limit point of A.
To show that b is a limit point of A, we have to show that every open set
containing b contains a point of A other than b.
We shall show this is the case by writing down all of the open sets
containing b and verifying that each contains a point of A other than b.
The only open sets containing b are X and {b, c, d, e} and both contain another
element of A, namely c. So b is a limit point of A.
The point d is a limit point of A, even though it is not in A. This is so since
every open set containing d contains a point of A. Similarly e is a limit point of A
even though it is not in A.

has no limit points, since for each x ∈ X, {x} is an open set containing no point of

A different from x.

3.1.4

Example.



Consider the subset A = [a, b) of R. Then it is easily verified

that every element in [a, b) is a limit point of A. The point b is also a limit point of

A.



3.1.5

Example.

Let (X,

τ ) be an indiscrete space and A a subset of X with

at least two elements. Then it is readily seen that every point of X is a limit point
of A. (Why did we insist that A have at least two points?)



The next proposition provides a useful way of testing whether a set is closed or
not.

CHAPTER 3. LIMIT POINTS

3.1.6

Proposition.

Let A be a subset of a topological space (X,

τ ). Then

A is closed in (X, τ ) if and only if A contains all of its limit points.

Proof.

We are required to prove that A is closed in (X,

τ ) if and only if A contains

all of its limit points; that is, we have to show that
(i) if A is a closed set, then it contains all of its limit points, and
(ii) if A contains all of its limit points, then it is a closed set.

Assume that A is closed in (X,

τ ). Suppose that p is a limit point of A which

belongs to X \ A. Then X \ A is an open set containing the limit point p of A.
Therefore X \ A contains an element of A. This is clearly false and so we have a
contradiction to our supposition. Therefore every limit point of A must belong to

A.
Conversely, assume that A contains all of its limit points. For each z ∈ X \ A,
our assumption implies that there exists an open set Uz 3 z such that Uz ∩ A = Ø;
that is, Uz ⊆ X \ A. Therefore X \ A =

S

z∈X\A Uz . (Check this!) So X \ A is a
union of open sets and hence is open. Consequently its complement, A, is closed.

3.1.7

Example.

As applications of Proposition 3.1.6 we have the following:

(i) the set [a, b) is not closed in R, since b is a limit point and b ∈
/ [a, b);
(ii) the set [a, b] is closed in R, since all the limit points of [a, b] (namely all the
elements of [a, b]) are in [a, b];
(iii) (a, b) is not a closed subset of R, since it does not contain the limit point a;
(iv) [a, ∞) is a closed subset of R.

From Proposition 3.1.6 it suffices to show that the set A ∪ A0 contains
all of its limit points or equivalently that no element of X \ (A ∪ A0 ) is a limit point

Proof.

of A ∪ A0 .
Let p ∈ X \ (A ∪ A0 ). As p ∈
/ A0 , there exists an open set U containing p with
U ∩ A = {p} or Ø. But p ∈
/ A, so U ∩ A = Ø. We claim also that U ∩ A0 = Ø. For
if x ∈ U then as U is an open set and U ∩ A = Ø, x ∈
/ A0 . Thus U ∩ A0 = Ø. That
is, U ∩ (A ∪ A0 ) = Ø, and p ∈ U. This implies p is not a limit point of A ∪ A0 and
so A ∪ A0 is a closed set.



τ

Definition.
Let A be a subset of a topological space (X, ). Then
the set A ∪ A0 consisting of A and all its limit points is called the closure of A

3.1.9

and is denoted by A.

3.1.10

Remark.

It is clear from Proposition 3.1.8 that A is a closed set. By

Proposition 3.1.6 and Exercises 3.1 #5 (i), every closed set containing A must also
contain the set A0 . So A ∪ A0 = A is the smallest closed set containing A. This
implies that A is the intersection of all closed sets containing A.

CHAPTER 3. LIMIT POINTS

3.1.11

Example.

Let X = {a, b, c, d, e} and

τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e}}.
Show that {b} = {b, e}, {a, c} = X , and {b, d} = {b, c, d, e}.
Proof.

To find the closure of a particular set, we shall find all the closed sets
containing that set and then select the smallest. We therefore begin by
writing down all of the closed sets – these are simply the complements of
all the open sets.

The closed sets are Ø, X, {b, c, d, e}, {a, b, e}, {b, e} and {a}. So the smallest
closed set containing {b} is {b, e}; that is, {b} = {b, e}. Similarly {a, c} = X , and

{b, d} = {b, c, d, e}.

3.1.12

Example.



Let Q be the subset of R consisting of all the rational

numbers. Prove that Q = R.
Proof.

Suppose Q 6= R. Then there exists an x ∈ R \ Q. As R\Q is open in

R, there exist a, b with a < b such that x ∈ (a, b) ⊆ R \ Q. But in every interval
(a, b) there is a rational number q ; that is, q ∈ (a, b). So q ∈ R \ Q which implies
q ∈ R \ Q. This is a contradiction, as q ∈ Q. Hence Q = R.

3.1.13

Definition.

Let A be a subset of a topological space (X,

A is said to be dense in X or everywhere dense in X if A = X.

τ ). Then

3.1. LIMIT POINTS AND CLOSURE

3.1.14

Example.

Let (X,

79

τ ) be a discrete space. Then every subset of X is

closed (since its complement is open). Therefore the only dense subset of X is X
itself, since each subset of X is its own closure.

3.1.15

Proposition.

Let A be a subset of a topological space (X,



τ ). Then

A is dense in X if and only if every non-empty open subset of X intersects A
non-trivially (that is, if U ∈ τ and U 6= Ø then A ∩ U 6= Ø.)
Proof.

Assume, firstly that every non-empty open set intersects A non-trivially.

If A = X , then clearly A is dense in X . If A 6= X , let x ∈ X \ A. If U ∈

τ and

x ∈ U then U ∩ A 6= Ø. So x is a limit point of A. As x is an arbitrary point in
X \ A, every point of X \ A is a limit point of A. So A0 ⊇ X \ A and then, by
Definition 3.1.9, A = A0 ∪ A = X ; that is, A is dense in X .
Conversely, assume A is dense in X . Let U be any non-empty open subset of

X . Suppose U ∩ A = Ø. Then if x ∈ U , x ∈
/ A and x is not a limit point of A,
since U is an open set containing x which does not contain any element of A. This
is a contradiction since, as A is dense in X , every element of X \ A is a limit point
of A. So our supposition is false and U ∩ A 6= Ø, as required.

p a point in N . Then N is said to be a neighbourhood of the point p if there
exists an open set U such that p ∈ U ⊆ N.

3.2.4

Example.

If (X,

τ ) is any topological space and U ∈ τ , then from

Definition 3.2.1, it follows that U is a neighbourhood of every point p ∈ U. So, for
example, every open interval (a, b) in R is a neighbourhood of every point that it



contains.

Example.

Let (X,

the set A is closed if and only if for each x ∈ X \ A there is a neighbourhood

N of x such that N ⊆ X \ A.

U ∈ τ if and only if for each x ∈ U there exists a neighbourhood N of x such
that N ⊆ U.

3.2.9

Corollary.

Let U be a subset of a topological space (X,

τ ). Then

U ∈ τ if and only if for each x ∈ U there exists a V ∈ τ such that x ∈ V ⊆ U.
Corollary 3.2.9 provides a useful test of whether a set is open or not. It says
that a set is open if and only if it contains an open set about each of its points.

3.3. CONNECTEDNESS

85

3.3

Connectedness

3.3.1

Remark.

We record here some definitions and facts you should already

know. Let S be any set of real numbers. If there is an element b in S such that

x ⩽ b, for all x ∈ S , then b is said to be the greatest element of S . Similarly if
S contains an element a such that a ⩽ x, for all x ∈ S , then a is called the least
element of S . A set S of real numbers is said to be bounded above if there exists
a real number c such that x ⩽ c, for all x ∈ S , and c is called an upper bound for
S . Similarly the terms “bounded below” and “lower bound” are defined. A set
which is bounded above and bounded below is said to be bounded.

Least Upper Bound Axiom:

Let S be a non-empty set of real numbers. If

S is bounded above, then it has a least upper bound.



The least upper bound, also called the supremum of S , denoted by sup(S),
may or may not belong to the set S . Indeed, the supremum of S is an element of

S if and only if S has a greatest element. For example, the supremum of the open
interval S = (1, 2) is 2 but 2 ∈
/ (1, 2), while the supremum of [3, 4] is 4 which does lie
in [3, 4] and 4 is the greatest element of [3, 4]. Any set S of real numbers which is
bounded below has a greatest lower bound which is also called the infimum and
is denoted by inf (S).

3.3.2

Lemma.

Let S be a subset of R which is bounded above and let p

be the supremum of S . If S is a closed subset of R, then p ∈ S .

Proof.

Suppose p ∈ R \ S . As R \ S is open there exist real numbers a and b

with a < b such that p ∈ (a, b) ⊆ R \ S . As p is the least upper bound for S and

a < p, it is clear that there exists an x ∈ S such that a < x. Also x < p < b, and so
x ∈ (a, b) ⊆ R \ S. But this is a contradiction, since x ∈ S. Hence our supposition is
false and p ∈ S.


86

CHAPTER 3. LIMIT POINTS

3.3.3

Proposition.

Let T be a clopen subset of R. Then either T = R or

T = Ø.

Suppose T 6= R and T 6= Ø. Then there exists an element x ∈ T and an

Proof.

element z ∈ R \ T . Without loss of generality, assume x < z . Put S = T ∩ [x, z].
Then S , being the intersection of two closed sets, is closed. It is also bounded
above, since z is obviously an upper bound. Let p be the supremum of S . By
Lemma 3.3.2, p ∈ S . Since p ∈ [x, z], p ⩽ z . As z ∈ R \ S , p 6= z and so p < z .
Now T is also an open set and p ∈ T . So there exist a and b in R with a < b
such that p ∈ (a, b) ⊆ T . Let t be such that p < t < min(b, z), where min(b, z)
denotes the smaller of b and z . So t ∈ T and t ∈ [p, z]. Thus t ∈ T ∩[x, z] = S . This
is a contradiction since t > p and p is the supremum of S . Hence our supposition is
false and consequently T = R or T = Ø.

3.3.4

Let (X,

Definition.



τ ) be a topological space. Then it is said to be

connected if the only clopen subsets of X are X and Ø.

So restating Proposition 3.3.3 we obtain:

then (X,

3.3.7

The topological space R is connected.

If (X,

τ ) is any discrete space with more than one element,

τ ) is not connected as each singleton set is clopen.

If (X,

τ ) is any indiscrete space, then it is connected as the

only clopen sets are X and Ø. (Indeed the only open sets are X and Ø.)

87

If X = {a, b, c, d, e} and

Example.

τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e}},
then (X,

3.3.9

τ ) is not connected as {b, c, d, e} is a clopen subset.

Remark.

From Definition 3.3.4 it follows that a topological space (X,



τ)

is not connected (that is, it is disconnected) if and only if there are non-empty open
sets A and B such that A ∩ B = Ø and A ∪ B = X .1 (See Exercises 3.3 #3.)
We conclude this section by recording that R2 (and indeed, Rn , for each n ⩾ 1)
is a connected space. However the proof is delayed to Chapter 5.
Connectedness is a very important property about which we shall say a lot more.

Exercises 3.3

1. Let S be a set of real numbers and T = {x : −x ∈ S}.
(a) Prove that the real number a is the infimum of S if and only if −a is the
supremum of T .
(b) Using (a) and the Least Upper Bound Axiom prove that every non-empty
set of real numbers which is bounded below has a greatest lower bound.
2. For each of the following sets S of real numbers find the greatest element and
the least upper bound, if they exist.
(i) S = R.

Postscript

In this chapter we have introduced the notion of limit point and shown that a set
is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points. Proposition 3.1.8 then tells us
that any set A has a smallest closed set A which contains it. The set A is called
the closure of A.
A subset A of a topological space (X,

τ ) is said to be dense in X if A = X . We

saw that Q is dense in R and the set I of all irrational numbers is also dense in R.
We introduced the notion of neighbourhood of a point and the notion of connected
topological space. We proved an important result, namely that R is connected. We
shall have much more to say about connectedness later.
In the exercises we introduced the notion of interior of a set, this concept being
complementary to that of closure of a set.

Chapter 4

Homeomorphisms
Introduction
In each branch of mathematics it is essential to recognize when two structures are
equivalent. For example two sets are equivalent, as far as set theory is concerned,
if there exists a bijective function which maps one set onto the other. Two groups
are equivalent, known as isomorphic, if there exists a a homomorphism of one to the
other which is one-to-one and onto. Two topological spaces are equivalent, known
as homeomorphic, if there exists a homeomorphism of one onto the other.

Subspaces

4.1.1

Definition.

Let Y be a non-empty subset of a topological space

(X, τ ). The collection τ Y = {O ∩ Y : O ∈ τ } of subsets of Y is a topology
on Y called the subspace topology (or the relative topology or the induced
topology or the topology induced on Y by τ ). The topological space (Y, τ Y )
is said to be a subspace of (X, τ ).
Of course you should check1 that TY is indeed a topology on Y .
4.1.2

Let X = {a, b, c, d, e, f },

Example.

τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e, f }},
and Y = {b, c, e}. Then the subspace topology on Y is

τ Y = {Y, Ø, {c}}.
4.1.3



Let X = {a, b, c, d, e},

Example.

τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e}},
and Y = {a, d, e}. Then the induced topology on Y is

4.1.4

Example.

τ Y = {Y, Ø, {a}, {d}, {a, d}, {d, e}}.



Let B be a basis for the topology

τ on X and let Y

be a non-empty subset of X .

Then it is not hard to show that the collection

BY = {B ∩ Y : B ∈ B} is a basis for the subspace topology τ Y on Y . [Exercise:
verify this.]
So let us consider the subset (1, 2) of R. A basis for the induced topology on

(1, 2) is the collection {(a, b) ∩ (1, 2) : a, b ∈ R, a < b}; that is, {(a, b) : a, b ∈ R, 1 ⩽
a < b ⩽ 2} is a basis for the induced topology on (1, 2).

1

As first observed by Bruce Blackadar and Stanislav Jabuka, Blackadar [44], this is not quite as
straightforward as one might think: given an infinite number of sets Ui : Ui ∈ Y one needs to prove
that their union is in
, such that Oi ∩ Y = Ui . As
Y . So for each Ui , one must select an Oi ∈
this selection of Oi is to be made for each i ∈ I, it may involve us in making an infinite number
of arbitrary choices which requires use of the Axiom of Choice. However, one can avoid using the
Axiom of Choice by selecting instead a special Oi , namely the union of all the open sets in
whose
intersection with Y is Ui .

But here we see some surprising things happening; e.g. [1, 1 21 ) is certainly not
an open set in R, but [1, 1 12 ) = (0, 1 21 ) ∩ [1, 2], is an open set in the subspace [1, 2].
Also (1, 2] is not open in R but is open in [1, 2]. Even [1, 2] is not open in R,
but is an open set in [1, 2].
So whenever we speak of a set being open we must make perfectly clear in what
space or what topology it is an open set.

4.1.6

Example.



Let Z be the subset of R consisting of all the integers. Prove

that the topology induced on Z by the euclidean topology on R is the discrete
topology.
Proof.

To prove that the induced topology, τ Z , on Z is discrete, it suffices, by
Proposition 1.1.9, to show that every singleton set in Z is open in τ Z ; that
is, if n ∈ Z then {n} ∈ τ Z .

Let n ∈ Z. Then {n} = (n − 1, n + 1) ∩ Z. But (n − 1, n + 1) is open in R and
therefore {n} is open in the induced topology on Z. Thus every singleton set in Z
is open in the induced topology on Z. So the induced topology is discrete.

Whenever we refer to

topology induced as a subspace of R. (Sometimes we shall refer to the induced
topology on these sets as the “usual topology”.)

Homeomorphisms

We now turn to the notion of equivalent topological spaces. We begin by considering
an example:

X = {a, b, c, d, e},

Y = {g, h, i, j, k},

τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e}},
and

τ 1 = {Y, Ø, {g}, {i, j}, {g, i, j}, {h, i, j, k}}.
It is clear that in an intuitive sense (X, τ ) is “equivalent” to (Y, τ 1 ). The function
f : X → Y defined by f (a) = g, f (b) = h, f (c) = i, f (d) = j, and f (e) = k,
provides the equivalence. We now formalize this.

4.2.1

Definition.

Let (X,

τ ) and (Y, τ 1) be topological spaces. Then

they are said to be homeomorphic if there exists a function f : X → Y which
has the following properties:
(i) f is one-to-one (that is f (x1 ) = f (x2 ) implies x1 = x2 ),
(ii) f is onto (that is, for any y ∈ Y there exists an x ∈ X such that f (x) = y ),

τ 1, f −1(U ) ∈ τ , and
(iv) for each V ∈ τ , f (V ) ∈ τ 1 .
(iii) for each U ∈

Further, the map f is said to be a homeomorphism between (X,

τ ) and (Y, τ 1).


We shall show that “∼
=” is an equivalence relation and use this to show that
all open intervals (a, b) are homeomorphic to each other. Example 4.2.2 is the first
step, as it shows that “∼
=” is a transitive relation.

4.2.2

Proof.
We are given that (X, τ ) ∼
= (Y, τ 1 ); that is, there exists a homeomorphism

f : (X, τ ) → (Y, τ 1 ). We are also given that (Y, τ 1 ) ∼
= (Z, τ 2 ); that is,
there exists a homeomorphism g : (Y, τ 1 ) → (Z, τ 2 ).
We are required to prove that (X, τ ) ∼
= (Z, τ 2 ); that is, we need to find
a homeomorphism h : (X, τ ) → (Z, τ 2 ). We will prove that the composite
map g ◦ f : X → Z is the required homeomorphism.

As (X,

g ◦ f : X → Z . [Thus g ◦ f (x) = g(f (x)), for all x ∈ X.] It is a routine task
to verify that g ◦ f is one-to-one and onto. Now let U ∈ τ 2 . Then, as g is a
homeomorphism g −1 (U ) ∈ τ 1 . Using the fact that f is a homeomorphism we obtain
that f −1 (g −1 (U )) ∈ τ . But f −1 (g −1 (U )) = (g ◦ f )−1 (U ). So g ◦ f has property
(iii) of Definition 4.2.1. Next let V ∈ τ . Then f (V ) ∈ τ 1 and so g(f (V )) ∈ τ 2 ;
that is g ◦ f (V ) ∈ τ 2 and we see that g ◦ f has property (iv) of Definition 4.2.1.
Hence g ◦ f is a homeomorphism.

The next three examples show that all open intervals in R are homeomorphic.
Length is certainly not a topological property. In particular, an open interval of finite
length, such as (0, 1), is homeomorphic to one of infinite length, such as (−∞, 1).
Indeed all open intervals are homeomorphic to R.

98

CHAPTER 4. HOMEOMORPHISMS

4.2.4

Example.

Prove that every two non-empty open intervals (a, b) and (c, d)

are homeomorphic.
Outline Proof.
By Remark 4.2.3 it suffices to show that (a, b) is homeomorphic to (0, 1) and

(c, d) is homeomorphic to (0, 1). But as a and b are arbitrary (except that
a < b), if (a, b) is homeomorphic to (0, 1) then (c, d) is also homeomorphic
to (0, 1). To prove that (a, b) is homeomorphic to (0, 1) it suffices to find a
homeomorphism f : (0, 1) → (a, b).
Let a, b ∈ R with a < b and consider the function f : (0, 1) → (a, b) given by

f (x) = a(1 − x) + bx.

Clearly f : (0, 1) → (a, b) is one-to-one and onto. It is also clear from the diagram
that the image under f of any open interval in (0, 1) is an open interval in (a, b);
that is,

f (open interval in (0, 1)) = an open interval in (a, b).
But every open set in (0, 1) is a union of open intervals in (0, 1) and so

f (open set in (0, 1)) = f (union of open intervals in (0, 1))
=

union of open intervals in (a, b)

=

open set in (a, b).

So condition (iv) of Definition 4.2.1 is satisfied. Similarly, we see that f −1 (open
set in (a, b)) is an open set in (0, 1). So condition (iii) of Definition 4.2.1 is also
satisfied.

4.2. HOMEOMORPHISMS

[Exercise:

99

write out the above proof carefully.]

Hence f is a homeomorphism and (0, 1) ∼
= (a, b), for all a, b ∈ R with a < b.
From the above it immediately follows that (a, b) ∼
= (c, d), as required.

4.2.5

Example.

Prove that the space R is homeomorphic to the open interval

(−1, 1) with the usual topology.
Outline Proof.

Define f : (−1, 1) → R by

f (x) =

.
1− | x |

It is readily verified that f is one-to-one and onto, and a diagrammatic argument
like that in Example 4.2.2 indicates that f is a homeomorphism.

4.3

Non-Homeomorphic Spaces

To prove two topological spaces are homeomorphic we have to find a homeomorphism
between them.
But, to prove that two topological spaces are not homeomorphic is often much
harder as we have to show that no homeomorphism exists. The following example
gives us a clue as to how we might go about showing this.

102

CHAPTER 4. HOMEOMORPHISMS

4.3.1

Prove that [0, 2] is not homeomorphic to the subspace

Example.

[0, 1] ∪ [2, 3] of R.
Proof.

Let (X,

τ ) = [0, 2] and (Y, τ 1) = [0, 1] ∪ [2, 3]. Then
[0, 1] = [0, 1] ∩ Y ⇒ [0, 1] is closed in (Y, τ 1 )
1

[0, 1] = (−1, 1 ) ∩ Y ⇒ [0, 1] is open in (Y, τ 1 ).

and

2

Thus Y is not connected, as it has [0, 1] as a proper non-empty clopen subset.
Suppose that (X, ) ∼
= (Y, 1 ). Then there exists a homeomorphism f : (X, ) →
(Y, 1 ). So f −1 ([0, 1]) is a proper non-empty clopen subset of X , and hence X is
not connected. This is false as [0, 2] = X is connected. (See Exercises 4.1 #15.)

τ

τ

τ

τ

So we have a contradiction and thus (X,

τ) ∼
6= (Y, τ 1 ).



What do we learn from this?

4.3.2

Proposition.

Any topological space homeomorphic to a connected

space is connected.



Proposition 4.3.2 gives us one way to try to show two topological spaces are
not homeomorphic . . . by finding a property “preserved by homeomorphisms” which
one space has and the other does not.

4.3. NON-HOMEOMORPHIC SPACES

103

We have met many properties “preserved by homeomorphisms” amongst the
exercises:
(i) T0 -space;
(ii) T1 -space;
(iii) T2 -space or Hausdorff space;
(iv) regular space;
(v) T3 -space;
(vi) satisfying the second axiom of countability;
(vii) separable space. [See Exercises 4.2 #7.]

There are also others:
(viii) discrete space;
(ix) indiscrete space;
(x) finite-closed topology;
(xi) countable-closed topology.
So together with connectedness we know twelve properties which are preserved
by homeomorphisms. Also two spaces (X,

τ ) and (Y, τ 1) cannot be homeomorphic

if X and Y have different cardinalities (e.g. X is countable and Y is uncountable)
or if

τ and τ 1 have different cardinalities.

Nevertheless when faced with a specific problem we may not have the one we
need. For example, show that (0, 1) is not homeomorphic to [0, 1] or show that R
is not homeomorphic to R2 . We shall see how to show that these spaces are not
homeomorphic shortly.

104

CHAPTER 4. HOMEOMORPHISMS

Before moving on to this let us settle the following question: which subspaces
of R are connected?
4.3.3

Definition.

A subset S of R is said to be an interval if it has the

following property: if x ∈ S , z ∈ S , and y ∈ R are such that x < y < z , then

y ∈ S.
4.3.4

Remarks.

Note the following:

(i) Each singleton set {x} is an interval.
(ii) Every interval has one of the following forms: {a}, [a, b], (a, b), [a, b), (a, b],

(−∞, a), (−∞, a], (a, ∞), [a, ∞), (−∞, ∞).
(iii) It follows from Example 4.2.6, Remark 4.2.7, and Exercises 4.2 #1, that every
interval is homeomorphic to (0, 1), [0, 1], [0, 1), or {0}. In Exercises 4.3 #1 we
are able to make an even stronger statement.
4.3.5

Proposition.

A subspace S of R is connected if and only if it is an

interval.
Proof.

That all intervals are connected can be proved in a similar fashion to

Proposition 3.3.3 by replacing R everywhere in the proof by the interval we are
trying to prove connected.
Conversely, let S be connected. Suppose x ∈ S, z ∈ S , x < y < z , and y ∈
/ S.
Then (−∞, y) ∩ S = (−∞, y] ∩ S is an open and closed subset of S . So S has
a clopen subset, namely (−∞, y) ∩ S . To show that S is not connected we have
to verify only that this clopen set is proper and non-empty. It is non-empty as it
contains x. It is proper as z ∈ S but z ∈
/ (−∞, y) ∩ S . So S is not connected. This
is a contradiction. Therefore S is an interval.



We now see a reason for the name “connected”. Subspaces of R such as [a, b],

(a, b), etc. are connected, while subspaces like X = [0, 1] ∪ [2, 3] ∪ [5, 6], which is a
union of “disconnected” pieces, are not connected.
Now let us turn to the problem of showing that (0, 1) ∼
6= [0, 1]. Firstly, we present
a seemingly trivial observation.

4.3. NON-HOMEOMORPHIC SPACES

105

τ ) → (Y, τ 1) be a homeomorphism. Let a ∈ X , so
that X \ {a} is a subspace of X and has induced topology τ 2 . Also Y \ {f (a)} is a
subspace of Y and has induced topology τ 3 . Then (X \ {a}, τ 2 ) is homeomorphic
to (Y \ {f (a)}, τ 3 ).
4.3.6

Let f : (X,

Remark.

Outline Proof.

Define g : X \{a} → Y \{f (a)} by g(x) = f (x), for all x ∈ X \{a}.

Then it is easily verified that g is a homeomorphism. (Write down a proof of this.)
As an immediate consequence of this we have:

4.3.7

If a, b, c, and d are real numbers with a < b and c < d,

Corollary.

then
(i) (a, b) ∼
6= [c, d),
(ii) (a, b) ∼
6= [c, d], and
(iii) [a, b) ∼
6= [c, d].

Proof. (i)

Let (X,

τ ) = [c, d) and (Y, τ 1) = (a, b).

Suppose that (X,

τ) ∼
=

(Y, τ 1 ). Then X \ {c} ∼
= Y \ {y}, for some y ∈ Y . But, X \ {c} = (c, d) is an
interval, and so is connected, while no matter which point we remove from (a, b)
the resultant space is disconnected. Hence by Proposition 4.3.2,

X \ {c} ∼
6= Y \ {y}, for each y ∈ Y.
This is a contradiction. So [c, d) ∼
6= (a, b).

[c, d] \ {c} is connected, while (a, b) \ {y} is disconnected for all y ∈ (a, b).
Thus (a, b) ∼
6= [c, d].
(iii)
Suppose that [a, b) ∼
= [c, d]. Then [c, d] \ {c} ∼
= [a, b) \ {y} for some
y ∈ [a, b). Therefore ([c, d] \ {c}) \ {d} ∼
= ([a, b) \ {y}) \ {z}, for some z ∈ [a, b) \ {y};
that is, (c, d) ∼
= [a, b) \ {y, z}, for some distinct y and z in [a, b). But (c, d) is
(ii)

connected, while [a, b) \ {y, z}, for any two distinct points y and z in [a, b), is
disconnected. So we have a contradiction. Therefore [a, b) ∼
6= [c, d].

local homeomorphism if each point x ∈ X has an open neighbourhood U such
that the restriction of f to U maps U homeomorphically onto an open subspace

V of (Y, τ 1 ); that is, if the topology induced on U by τ is τ 2 and the topology
induced on V = f (U ) by τ 1 is τ 3 , then f is a homeomorphism of (U, τ 2 ) onto
(V, τ 3 ). The topological space (X, τ ) is said to be locally homeomorphic to
(Y, τ 1 ) if there exists a local homeomorphism of (X, τ ) into (Y, τ 1 ).

4.4. POSTSCRIPT

Postscript

There are three important ways of creating new topological spaces from old ones:
forming subspaces, products, and quotient spaces. We examine all three in due
course. Forming subspaces was studied in this chapter. This allowed us to introduce
the important spaces Q, [a, b], (a, b), etc.
We defined the central notion of homeomorphism. We noted that “∼
=” is an
equivalence relation.

A property is said to be topological if it is preserved by

homeomorphisms; that is, if (X,

τ) ∼
= (Y, τ 1 ) and (X, τ ) has the property then

(Y, τ 1 ) must also have the property. Connectedness was shown to be a topological
property.

So any space homeomorphic to a connected space is connected.

(A

number of other topological properties were also identified.) We formally defined the
notion of an interval in R, and showed that the intervals are precisely the connected
subspaces of R.
Given two topological spaces (X,

τ ) and (Y, τ 1) it is an interesting task to

show whether they are homeomorphic or not. We proved that every interval in R
is homeomorphic to one and only one of [0, 1], (0, 1), [0, 1), and {0}. In the next
section we show that R is not homeomorphic to R2 . A tougher problem is to show
that R2 is not homeomorphic to R3 . This will be done later via the Jordan curve
theorem. Still the crème de la crème is the fact that Rn ∼
= Rm if and only if n = m.
This is best approached via algebraic topology, which is only touched upon in this
book.
Exercises 4.2 #6 introduced the notion of group of homeomorphisms, which is
an interesting and important topic in its own right.

Chapter 5

Continuous Mappings
Introduction
In most branches of pure mathematics we study what in category theory are called
“objects” and “arrows”.

In linear algebra the objects are vector spaces and the

arrows are linear transformations. In group theory the objects are groups and the
arrows are homomorphisms, while in set theory the objects are sets and the arrows
are functions. In topology the objects are the topological spaces. We now introduce
the arrows . . . the continuous mappings.

5.1

Continuous Mappings

Of course we are already familiar1 with the notion of a continuous function from R
into R.
A function f : R → R is said to be continuous if for each a ∈ R and each
positive real number ε, there exists a positive real number δ such that | x − a |< δ
implies | f (x) − f (a) |< ε.
It is not at all obvious how to generalize this definition to general topological
spaces where we do not have “absolute value” or “subtraction”. So we shall seek
another (equivalent) definition of continuity which lends itself more to generalization.
1

The early part of this section assumes that you have some knowledge of real analysis and, in
particular, the ε–δ definition of continuity. If this is not the case, then proceed directly to Definition
5.1.3. If you would like to refresh your knowledge in this area, you might like to look at the classic
book “A course of pure mathematics” by G.H. Hardy, which is available to download at no cost from

5.1. CONTINUOUS MAPPINGS

111

It is easily seen that f : R → R is continuous if and only if for each a ∈ R
and each interval (f (a) − ε, f (a) + ε), for ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such
that f (x) ∈ (f (a) − ε , f (a) + ε) for all x ∈ (a − δ , a + δ).
This definition is an improvement since it does not involve the concept “absolute
value” but it still involves “subtraction”.

The next lemma shows how to avoid

subtraction.

5.1.1

Lemma.

Let f be a function mapping R into itself.

Then f is

continuous if and only if for each a ∈ R and each open set U containing f (a),
there exists an open set V containing a such that f (V ) ⊆ U .

Proof.

Assume that f is continuous. Let a ∈ R and let U be any open set

containing f (a). Then there exist real numbers c and d such that f (a) ∈ (c, d) ⊆ U .
Put ε equal to the smaller of the two numbers d − f (a) and f (a) − c, so that

(f (a) − ε , f (a) + ε) ⊆ U.
As the mapping f is continuous there exists a δ > 0 such that f (x) ∈ (f (a) −

ε , f (a) + ε) for all x ∈ (a − δ , a + δ). Let V be the open set (a − δ , a + δ). Then
a ∈ V and f (V ) ⊆ U , as required.
Conversely assume that for each a ∈ R and each open set U containing f (a)
there exists an open set V containing a such that f (V ) ⊆ U .

We have to

show that f is continuous. Let a ∈ R and ε be any positive real number. Put

U = (f (a) − ε , f (a) + ε). So U is an open set containing f (a). Therefore there
exists an open set V containing a such that f (V ) ⊆ U . As V is an open set
containing a, there exist real numbers c and d such that a ∈ (c, d) ⊆ V . Put δ equal
to the smaller of the two numbers d − a and a − c, so that (a − δ , a + δ) ⊆ V . Then
for all x ∈ (a − δ , a + δ), f (x) ∈ f (V ) ⊆ U , as required. So f is continuous.


We could use the property described in Lemma 5.1.1 to define continuity,
however the following lemma allows us to make a more elegant definition.

Let f be a mapping of a topological space (X, ) into a
topological space (Y, 0 ). Then the following two conditions are equivalent:

τ such that a ∈ V ⊆ f −1(U ). By Corollary 3.2.9

Therefore there exists a V ∈
a ∈ f −1 (U ) there exists a V ∈
this implies that f −1 (U ) ∈

τ . So condition (i) is satisfied.



Putting together Lemmas 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 we see that f : R → R is continuous
if and only if for each open subset U of R, f −1 (U ) is an open set.
This leads us to define the notion of a continuous function between two
topological spaces as follows:

τ ) and (Y, τ 1) be topological spaces and f a
function from X into Y . Then f : (X, τ ) → (Y, τ 1 ) is said to be a continuous
mapping if for each U ∈ τ 1 , f −1 (U ) ∈ τ .
5.1.3

Definition.

Let (X,

From the above remarks we see that this definition of continuity coincides with
the usual definition when (X,

τ ) = (Y, τ 1) = R.

5.1. CONTINUOUS MAPPINGS

113

Let us go through a few easy examples to see how nice this definition of
continuity is to apply in practice.
Consider f : R → R given by f (x) = x, for all x ∈ R; that
is, f is the identity function. Then for any open set U in R, f −1 (U ) = U and so is

5.1.4

Example.

open. Hence f is continuous.



Let f : R → R be given by f (x) = c, for c a constant, and all
x ∈ R. Then let U be any open set in R. Clearly f −1 (U ) = R if c ∈ U and Ø if
c 6∈ U . In both cases, f −1 (U ) is open. So f is continuous.

Recall that a mapping is continuous if and only if the inverse image of every
open set is an open set.
Therefore, to show f is not continuous we have to find only one set U
such that f −1 (U ) is not open.

Then f −1 ((1, 3)) = (2, 3], which is not an open set.

Therefore f is not

a space (Y, 0 ). Then f is continuous if and only if for each x ∈ X and each

If f : (X, τ ) → (Y, τ 1 ) and g : (Y, τ 1 ) → (Z, τ 2 ) are continuous mappings,
then the composite function g ◦ f : (X, τ ) → (Z, τ 2 ) is continuous.

5.1.8

Let (X,

Proposition.

Proof.
To prove that the composite function g ◦ f : (X, τ ) → (Z, τ 2 ) is continuous,
we have to show that if U ∈ τ 2 , then (g ◦ f )−1 (U ) ∈ τ .
But (g ◦ f )−1 (U ) = f −1 (g −1 (U )).

τ 2). Since g is continuous, g−1(U ) is open in τ 1. Then
τ as f is continuous. But f −1(g−1(U )) = (g ◦ f )−1(U ).

Let U be open in (Z,
f −1 (g −1 (U )) is open in
Thus g ◦ f is continuous.



The next result shows that continuity can be described in terms of closed sets
instead of open sets if we wish.

5.1.9

Proposition.

Let (X,

τ ) and (Y, τ 1) be topological spaces. Then

f : (X, τ ) → (Y, τ 1 ) is continuous if and only if for every closed subset S of Y,
f −1 (S) is a closed subset of X .

Proof.

This result follows immediately once you recognize that

f −1 (complement of S) = complement of f −1 (S).

If you have not read Lemma 5.1.2 and its proof you should do so now.

5.1. CONTINUOUS MAPPINGS

5.1.10

Remark.

115

Of course here is a relationship between continuous maps

and homeomorphisms: if f : (X,

τ ) → (Y, τ 1) is a homeomorphism then it is a

continuous map. Of course not every continuous map is a homeomorphism.
However the following proposition, whose proof follows from the definitions of
“continuous” and “homeomorphism” tells the full story.

5.1.11

Proposition.

Let (X,

τ ) and (Y, τ 0) be topological spaces and f

a function from X into Y . Then f is a homeomorphism if and only if
(i) f is continuous,
(ii) f is one-to-one and onto; that is, the inverse function f −1 : Y → X exists,
and
(iii) f −1 is continuous.

A useful result is the following proposition which tells us that the restriction of
a continuous map is a continuous map. Its routine proof is left to the reader – see
also Exercises 5.1 #8.

Intermediate Value Theorem

τ ) and (Y, τ 1) be topological spaces and

(Y, τ 1 ) is connected.

5.2.1

Proposition.

Proof.

Suppose (Y,

Let (X,

τ 1) is not connected. Then it has a clopen subset U such

that U 6= Ø and U 6= Y . Then f −1 (U ) is an open set, since f is continuous, and
also a closed set, by Proposition 5.1.9; that is, f −1 (U ) is a clopen subset of X .
Now f −1 (U ) 6= Ø as f is surjective and U 6= Ø. Also f −1 (U ) 6= X , since if it were

U would equal Y , by the surjectivity of f . Thus (X, τ ) is not connected. This is a
contradiction. Therefore (Y, τ 1 ) is connected.

The above proposition would be false if the condition

connected (i.e. disconnected) then there exists no mapping of (X, τ ) onto

(iii) Proposition 5.2.1 tells us that if (X,

mappings of R onto Q (or onto Z), none of them are continuous. Indeed in
Exercises 5.2 # 10 we observe that the only continuous mappings of R into Q



(or into Z) are the constant mappings.

The following strengthened version of the notion of connectedness is often
useful.
5.2.3

A topological space (X,

Definition.

τ ) is said to be path-connected

(or pathwise connected) if for each pair of (distinct) points a and b of X
there exists a continuous mapping f : [0, 1] → (X,

τ ), such that f (0) = a and

f (1) = b. The mapping f is said to be a path joining a to b.

5.2.4

Example.

It is readily seen that every interval is path-connected.



5.2.5

Example.

For each n ⩾ 1, Rn is path-connected.



5.2.6

Proof.

Proposition.

Let (X,

Every path-connected space is connected.

τ ) be a path-connected space and suppose that it is not

connected.
Then it has a proper non-empty clopen subset U . So there exist a and b such
that a ∈ U and b ∈ X \ U . As (X,

τ ) is path-connected there exists a continuous

τ

function f : [0, 1] → (X, ) such that f (0) = a and f (1) = b.
However, f −1 (U ) is a clopen subset of [0, 1]. As a ∈ U, 0 ∈ f −1 (U ) and so

f −1 (U ) 6= Ø. As b 6∈ U, 1 6∈ f −1 (U ) and thus f −1 (U ) 6= [0, 1]. Hence f −1 (U ) is
a proper non-empty clopen subset of [0, 1], which contradicts the connectedness of
[0, 1].
Consequently (X,

τ ) is connected.



5.2. INTERMEDIATE VALUE THEOREM

5.2.7

Remark.

119

The converse of Proposition 5.2.6 is false; that is, not every

connected space is path-connected. An example of such a space is the following
subspace of R2 :

X = {hx, yi : y = sin(1/x), 0 < x ⩽ 1} ∪ {h0, yi : −1 ⩽ y ⩽ 1}.
[Exercises 5.2 #6 shows that X is connected. That X is not path-connected can
be seen by showing that there is no path joining h0, 0i to, say, the point h1/π, 0i.
Draw a picture and try to convince yourself of this.]



We can now show that R ∼
6 = R2 .
5.2.8

Example.

Clearly R2 \{h0, 0i} is path-connected and hence, by Proposition

However, by Proposition 4.3.5, R \ {a}, for any a ∈ R, is
disconnected. Hence R ∼
6 = R2 .


5.2.6, is connected.

We now present the Weierstrass Intermediate Value Theorem which is a beautiful
application of topology to the theory of functions of a real variable. The topological
concept crucial to the result is that of connectedness.

5.2.9

Theorem.

(Weierstrass Intermediate Value Theorem)

Let f : [a, b] → R be continuous and let f (a) 6= f (b). Then for every number p
between f (a) and f (b) there is a point c ∈ [a, b] such that f (c) = p.

Proof.

As [a, b] is connected and f is continuous, Proposition 5.2.1 says that

f ([a, b]) is connected. By Proposition 4.3.5 this implies that f ([a, b]) is an interval.
Now f (a) and f (b) are in f ([a, b]). So if p is between f (a) and f (b), p ∈ f ([a, b]),
that is, p = f (c), for some c ∈ [a, b].


5.2.10

Corollary.

If f : [a, b] → R is continuous and such that f (a) > 0

and f (b) < 0, then there exists an x ∈ [a, b] such that f (x) = 0.

CHAPTER 5. CONTINUOUS MAPPINGS

5.2.11

Corollary.

(Fixed Point Theorem)

Let f be a continuous

mapping of [0, 1] into [0, 1]. Then there exists a z ∈ [0, 1] such that f (z) = z .
(The point z is called a fixed point.)

Proof.

If f (0) = 0 or f (1) = 1, the result is obviously true. Thus it suffices to

consider the case when f (0) > 0 and f (1) < 1.
Let g : [0, 1] → R be defined by g(x) = x − f (x). Clearly g is continuous,

g(0) = −f (0) < 0, and g(1) = 1 − f (1) > 0. Consequently, by Corollary 5.2.10,

Corollary 5.2.11 is a special case of a very important theorem

called the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem which says that if you map an ndimensional cube continuously into itself then there is a fixed point. [There
are many proofs of this theorem, but most depend on methods of algebraic topology.
An unsophisticated proof is given in Kuratowski [249] on pp. 238–239.]

Postscript

In this chapter we said that a mapping3 between topological spaces is called
“continuous” if it has the property that the inverse image of every open set is
an open set. This is an elegant definition and easy to understand. It contrasts
with the one we meet in real analysis which was mentioned at the beginning of
this section. We have generalized the real analysis definition, not for the sake of
generalization, but rather to see what is really going on.
The Weierstrass Intermediate Value Theorem seems intuitively obvious, but we
now see it follows from the fact that R is connected and that any continuous image
of a connected space is connected.
We introduced a stronger property than connected, namely path-connected.
In many cases it is not sufficient to insist that a space be connected, it must be
path-connected. This property plays an important role in algebraic topology.
We shall return to the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem in due course. It is a
powerful theorem. Fixed point theorems play important roles in various branches
of mathematics including topology, functional analysis, and differential equations.
They are still a topic of research activity today.
In Exercises 5.2 #9 and #10 we met the notions of “component” and “totally
disconnected”. Both of these are important for an understanding of connectedness.

Metric Spaces
Introduction
The most important class of topological spaces is the class of metric spaces. Metric
spaces provide a rich source of examples in topology. But more than this, most of
the applications of topology to analysis are via metric spaces.
The notion of metric space was introduced in 1906 by Maurice Fréchet and
developed and named by Felix Hausdorff in 1914 (Hausdorff [173]).

6.1

Metric Spaces

6.1.1

Definition.

Let X be a non-empty set and d a real-valued function

defined on X × X such that for a, b ∈ X :
(i) d(a, b) ⩾ 0 and d(a, b) = 0 if and only if a = b;
(ii) d(a, b) = d(b, a); and
(iii) d(a, c) ⩽ d(a, b) + d(b, c), [the triangle inequality] for all a, b and c in X .
Then d is said to be a metric on X , (X, d) is called a metric space and d(a, b)
is referred to as the distance between a and b.

124

6.1. METRIC SPACES

6.1.2

Example.

125

The function d : R × R → R given by

d(a, b) = |a − b|,

a, b ∈ R

is a metric on the set R since
(i) |a − b| ⩾ 0, for all a and b in R, and |a − b| = 0 if and only if a = b,
(ii) |a − b| = |b − a|, and
(iii) |a − c| ⩽ |a − b| + |b − c|. (Deduce this from |x + y| ⩽ |x| + |y|.)
We call d the euclidean metric on R.

6.1.3

Example.



The function d : R2 × R2 → R given by

d(ha1 , a2 i, hb1 , b2 i) =

q

(a1 − b1 )2 + (a2 − b2 )2

is a metric on R2 called the euclidean metric on R2 .

into R defined by

d(a, b) =

if a = b
if a 6= b.

Then d is a metric on X and is called the discrete metric.

CHAPTER 6. METRIC SPACES

Many important examples of metric spaces are “function spaces". For these the
set X on which we put a metric is a set of functions.
6.1.5

Example.

Let C[0, 1] denote the set of continuous functions from [0, 1]

into R. A metric is defined on this set by

Z 1

d(f, g) =

|f (x) − g(x)| dx

0
where f and g are in C[0, 1].
A moment’s thought should tell you that d(f, g) is precisely the area of the
region which lies between the graphs of the functions and the lines x = 0 and x = 1,
as illustrated below.



6.1. METRIC SPACES

6.1.6

Example.

127

Again let C[0, 1] be the set of all continuous functions from

[0, 1] into R. Another metric is defined on C[0, 1] as follows:
d∗ (f, g) = sup{|f (x) − g(x)| : x ∈ [0, 1]}.
Clearly d∗ (f, g) is just the largest vertical gap between the graphs of the functions

f and g .



6.1.7

Example.

We can define another metric on R2 by putting

d∗ (ha1 , a2 i, hb1 , b2 i) = max{|a1 − b1 |, |a2 − b2 |}
where max{x, y} equals the larger of the two numbers x and y .

6.1.8

Example.



Yet another metric on R2 is given by

d1 (ha1 , a2 i, hb1 , b2 i) = |a1 − b1 | + |a2 − b2 |.



128

CHAPTER 6. METRIC SPACES

A rich source of examples of metric spaces is the family of normed vector spaces.

6.1.9

Let V be a vector space over the field of real or complex

Example.

numbers. A norm k k on V is a map : V → R such that for all a, b ∈ V and λ in
the field
(i) k a k ⩾ 0 and k a k= 0 if and only if a = 0,
(ii) k a + b k ⩽ k a k + k b k, and
(iii) k λa k= |λ| k a k.
A normed vector space (V, k k) is a vector space V with a norm k k.
Let (V, k k) be any normed vector space. Then there is a corresponding metric,

d, on the set V given by d(a, b) =k a − b k, for a and b in V .
It is easily checked that d is indeed a metric. So every normed vector space
is also a metric space in a natural way.
For example, R3 is a normed vector space if we put

q
k hx1 , x2 , x3 i k= x21 + x22 + x23 ,

for x1 , x2 , and x3 in R.

So R3 becomes a metric space if we put

d(ha1 , b1 , c1 i, ha2 , b2 , c2 i) = k (a1 − a2 , b1 − b2 , c1 − c2 ) k
q
=
(a1 − a2 )2 + (b1 − b2 )2 + (c1 − c2 )2 .
Indeed Rn , for any positive integer n, is a normed vector space if we put

q
k hx1 , x2 , . . . , xn i k= x21 + x22 + · · · + x2n .
So Rn becomes a metric space if we put

d(ha1 , a2 , . . . , an i, hb1 , b2 , . . . , bn i) = k ha1 − b1 , a2 − b2 , . . . , an − bn i k
q
=
(a1 − b1 )2 + (a2 − b2 )2 + · · · + (an − bn )2 .

In a normed vector space (N, k k) the open ball with centre a and radius r
is defined to be the set

Br (a) = {x : x ∈ N and k x − a k< r}.
This suggests the following definition for metric spaces:

Let (X, d) be a metric space and r any positive

Then the open ball about a ∈ X of radius r is the set

Br (a) = {x : x ∈ X and d(a, x) < r}.

The proof of the following Lemma is quite easy (especially if you draw a diagram)
and so is left for you to supply.

6.1.15

Lemma.

Let (X, d) be a metric space and a and b points of X .

Further, let δ1 and δ2 be positive real numbers. If c ∈ Bδ1 (a) ∩ Bδ2 (b), then
there exists a δ > 0 such that Bδ (c) ⊆ Bδ1 (a) ∩ Bδ2 (b).

The next Corollary follows in a now routine way from Lemma 6.1.15.

6.1.16

Let (X, d) be a metric space and B1 and B2 open balls

Corollary.

in (X, d). Then B1 ∩ B2 is a union of open balls in (X, d).



Finally we are able to link metric spaces with topological spaces.

6.1.17

Proposition.

Let (X, d) be a metric space. Then the collection of

open balls in (X, d) is a basis for a topology

[The topology

τ on X .

τ is referred to as the topology induced by the metric d, and

(X, τ ) is called the induced topological space or the corresponding topological
space or the associated topological space.]
Proof.

This follows from Proposition 2.2.8 and Corollary 6.1.16.

6.1.18

Example.



If d is the euclidean metric on R then a basis for the topology

τ induced by the metric d is the set of all open balls. But Bδ (a) = (a − δ , a + δ).
From this it is readily seen that τ is the euclidean topology on R. So the euclidean
metric on R induces the euclidean topology on R.



132

CHAPTER 6. METRIC SPACES

6.1.19

Example.

From Exercises 2.3 #1 (ii) and Example 6.1.12, it follows
that the euclidean metric on the set R2 induces the euclidean topology on R2 . 

6.1.20

Example.
From Exercises 2.3 #1 (i) and Example 6.1.13 it follows
that the metric d∗ also induces the euclidean topology on the set R2 .

It is left as an exercise for you to prove that the metric d1 of Example 6.1.14
also induces the euclidean topology on R2 .
6.1.21

Example.

If d is the discrete metric on a set X then for each

x ∈ X, B 1 (x) = {x}. So all the singleton sets are open in the topology τ induced
2
on X by d. Consequently, τ is the discrete topology.

We saw in Examples 6.1.19, 6.1.20, and 6.1.14 three different metrics on the
same set which induce the same topology.
6.1.22

Definition.

Metrics on a set X are said to be equivalent if they

induce the same topology on X .
So the metrics d, d∗ , and d1 , of Examples 6.1.3, 6.1.13, and 6.1.14 on R2 are
equivalent.

τ the topology
induced on X by the metric d. Then a subset U of X is open in (X, τ ) if and

6.1.23

Proposition.

Let (X, d) be a metric space and

only if for each a ∈ U there exists an ε > 0 such that the open ball Bε (a) ⊆ U .

Proof.

Assume that U ∈

τ . Then, by Propositions 2.3.2 and 6.1.17, for any

a ∈ U there exists a point b ∈ X and a δ > 0 such that a ∈ Bδ (b) ⊆ U.
Let ε = δ − d(a, b). Then it is readily seen that

a ∈ Bε (a) ⊆ U.
Conversely, assume that U is a subset of X with the property that for each a ∈ U
there exists an εa > 0 such that Bεa (a) ⊆ U . Then, by Propositions 2.3.3 and
6.1.17, U is an open set.



6.1. METRIC SPACES

133

We have seen that every metric on a set X induces a topology on the set X .
However, we shall now show that not every topology on a set is induced by a metric.
First, a definition which you have already met in the exercises. (See Exercises 4.1
#13. )

6.1.24

Definition.

A topological space (X,

τ ) is said to be a Hausdorff

space (or a T2 -space) if for each pair of distinct points a and b in X , there
exist open sets U and V such that a ∈ U, b ∈ V , and U ∩ V = Ø.
Of course R, R2 and all discrete spaces are examples of Hausdorff spaces, while
any set with at least 2 elements and which has the indiscrete topology is not a
Hausdorff space. With a little thought we see that Z with the finite-closed topology
is also not a Hausdorff space. (Convince yourself of all of these facts.)

6.1.25

Proposition.

Let (X, d) be any metric space and

induced on X by d. Then (X,

Proof.

τ the topology

τ ) is a Hausdorff space.

Let a and b be any points of X , with a 6= b. Then d(a, b) > 0. Put

ε = d(a, b). Consider the open balls Bε/2 (a) and Bε/2 (b). Then these are open sets
in (X, τ ) with a ∈ Bε/2 (a) and b ∈ Bε/2 (b). So to show τ is Hausdorff we have to
prove only that Bε/2 (a) ∩ Bε/2 (b) = Ø.
Suppose x ∈ Bε/2 (a) ∩ Bε/2 (b). Then d(x, a) < 2ε and d(x, b) < 2ε . Hence

d(a, b) ⩽ d(a, x) + d(x, b)
ε ε
<
+ = ε.
2 2
This says d(a, b) < ε, which is false. Consequently there exists no x in Bε/2 (a) ∩

Bε/2 (b); that is, Bε/2 (a) ∩ Bε/2 (b) = Ø, as required.

6.1.26

Remark.



Putting Proposition 6.1.25 together with the comments which

preceded it, we see that an indiscrete space with at least two points has a topology
which is not induced by any metric. Also Z with the finite-closed topology

τ is not induced by any metric on Z.

a metric d on the set X with the property that τ is the topology induced by d.

So, for example, the set Z with the finite-closed topology is not a metrizable
space.
Warning.

One should not be misled by Proposition 6.1.25 into thinking that every

Hausdorff space is metrizable. Later on we shall be able to produce (using infinite
products) examples of Hausdorff spaces which are not metrizable. [Metrizability of
topological spaces is quite a technical topic. For necessary and sufficient conditions
for metrizability see Theorem 9.1, page 195, of the book Dugundji [113].]

Locally Euclidean Spaces and Topological Manifolds
15. A topological space (X,

τ ) is said to be locally euclidean if there exists a

positive integer n such that each point x ∈ X has an open neighbourhood
homeomorphic to an open ball about 0 in Rn with the euclidean metric. A
Hausdorff locally euclidean space is said to be a topological manifold.1
(i)

Prove that every non-trivial interval (a, b), a, b ∈ R, is locally euclidean.

(ii)

Let S1 be the subspace of R2 consisting of all x ∈ R2 such that d(x, 0) = 1,
where d is the Euclidean metric. Show that the space S1 is locally euclidean.

(iii)

Show that every topological space locally homeomorphic to Rn , for any
positive integer n, is locally euclidean. (See Exercises 4.3 #9.)

(iv)* Find an example of a locally euclidean space which is not a topological
manifold.

1

There are different definitions of topological manifold in the literature (cf. Kunen and Vaughan
[248]; Lee [254]). In particular some definitions require the space to be connected – what we call a
connected manifold – and older definitions require the space to be metrizable. A Hausdorff space in
which each point has an open neighbourhood homeomorphic either to Rn or to the closed half-space
{< x1 , x2 , . . . , xn >: xi ⩾ 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , n} of Rn , for some positive integer n, is said to be a topological
manifold with boundary. There is a large literature on manifolds with more structure, especially
differentiable manifolds (Gadea and Masque [147]; Barden and Thomas [33]), smooth manifolds
(Lee [255]) and Riemannian manifolds or Cauchy-Riemann manifolds or CR-manifolds.

Convergence of Sequences

You are familiar with the notion of a convergent sequence of real numbers.

It

is defined as follows. The sequence x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . . of real numbers is said to
converge to the real number x if given any ε > 0 there exists an integer n0 such
that for all n ⩾ n0 , |xn − x| < ε.
It is obvious how this definition can be extended from R with the euclidean
metric to any metric space.

6.2.1

Definitions.

Let (X, d) be a metric space and x1 , . . . , xn , . . . a

sequence of points in X . Then the sequence is said to converge to x ∈ X if
given any ε > 0 there exists an integer n0 such that for all n ⩾ n0 , d(x, xn ) < ε.
This is denoted by xn → x.
The sequence y1 , y2 , . . . , yn , . . . of points in (X, d) is said to be convergent if
there exists a point y ∈ X such that yn → y .

The next Proposition is easily proved, so its proof is left as an exercise.

6.2.2

Proposition.

Let x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . . be a sequence of points in a

metric space (X, d). Further, let x and y be points in (X, d) such that xn → x
and xn → y . Then x = y .



For convenience we say that a subset A of a metric space (X, d) is closed
(respectively, open) in the metric space (X, d) if it is closed (respectively, open) in
the topology

τ induced on X by the metric d.

142

CHAPTER 6. METRIC SPACES

The following proposition tells us the surprising fact that the topology of a
metric space can be described entirely in terms of its convergent sequences.

6.2.3

Proposition.

Let (X, d) be a metric space. A subset A of X is closed

in (X, d) if and only if every convergent sequence of points in A converges to a
point in A. (In other words, A is closed in (X, d) if and only if an → x, where

x ∈ X and an ∈ A for all n, implies x ∈ A.)

Proof.

Assume that A is closed in (X, d) and let an → x, where an ∈ A for

all positive integers n. Suppose that x ∈ X \ A. Then, as X \ A is an open set
containing x, there exists an open ball Bε (x) such that x ∈ Bε (x) ⊆ X \ A. Noting
that each an ∈ A, this implies that d(x, an ) > ε for each n. Hence the sequence

a1 , a2 , . . . , an , . . . does not converge to x. This is a contradiction. So x ∈ A, as
required.
Conversely, assume that every convergent sequence of points in A converges to
a point of A. Suppose that X \ A is not open. Then there exists a point y ∈ X \ A
such that for each ε > 0, Bε (y) ∩ A 6= Ø. For each positive integer n, let xn be any
point in B1/n (y) ∩ A. Then we claim that xn → y . To see this let ε be any positive
real number, and n0 any integer greater than 1/ε. Then for each n ⩾ n0 ,

xn ∈ B1/n (y) ⊆ B1/n0 (y) ⊆ Bε (y).
So xn → y and, by our assumption, y ∈
/ A. This is a contradiction and so X \ A is
open and thus A is closed in (X, d).



6.2. CONVERGENCE OF SEQUENCES

143

Having seen that the topology of a metric space can be described in terms of
convergent sequences, we should not be surprised that continuous functions can also
be so described.

6.2.4

Proposition.

Let (X, d) and (Y, d1 ) be metric spaces and f a

τ and τ 1 be the topologies determined by d
and d1 , respectively. Then f : (X, τ ) → (Y, τ 1 ) is continuous if and only if
mapping of X into Y .

Let

xn → x ⇒ f (xn ) → f (x); that is, if x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . . is a sequence of points in
(X, d) converging to x, then the sequence of points f (x1 ), f (x2 ), . . . , f (xn ), . . .
in (Y, d1 ) converges to f (x).

Proof.

Assume that xn → x ⇒ f (xn ) → f (x). To verify that f is continuous

it suffices to show that the inverse image of every closed set in (Y,
in (X,

τ 1) is closed

τ ). So let A be closed in (Y, τ 1). Let x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . be a sequence of

points in f −1 (A) convergent to a point x ∈ X . As xn → x, f (xn ) → f (x). But
since each f (xn ) ∈ A and A is closed, Proposition 6.2.3 then implies that f (x) ∈ A.
Thus x ∈ f −1 (A). So we have shown that every convergent sequence of points
from f −1 (A) converges to a point of f −1 (A). Thus f −1 (A) is closed, and hence f
is continuous.
Conversely, let f be continuous and xn → x.

Let ε be any positive real

τ

number. Then the open ball Bε (f (x)) is an open set in (Y, 1 ). As f is continuous,
f −1 (Bε (f (x)) is an open set in (X, ) and it contains x. Therefore there exists a
δ > 0 such that
x ∈ Bδ (x) ⊆ f −1 (Bε (f (x))).

τ

As xn → x, there exists a positive integer n0 such that for all n ⩾ n0 , xn ∈ Bδ (x).
Therefore

f (xn ) ∈ f (Bδ (x)) ⊆ Bε (f (x)), for all n ⩾ n0 .
Thus f (xn ) → f (x).

The Corollary below is easily deduced from Proposition 6.2.4.

CHAPTER 6. METRIC SPACES

6.2.5

Corollary.

Let (X, d) and (Y, d1 ) be metric spaces, f a mapping of X

τ and τ 1 the topologies determined by d and d1, respectively. Then
f : (X, τ ) → (Y, τ 1 ) is continuous if and only if for each x0 ∈ X and ε > 0,
into Y , and

there exists a δ > 0 such that x ∈ X and d(x, x0 ) < δ ⇒ d1 (f (x), f (x0 )) < ε. 

sequences in metric spaces. You might ask why we have
not previously discussed the convergence of sequences

Completeness

6.3.1

Definition.

A sequence x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . . of points in a metric space

(X, d) is said to be a Cauchy sequence if given any real number ε > 0, there
exists a positive integer n0 , such that for all integers m ⩾ n0 and n ⩾ n0 ,
d(xm , xn ) < ε.

6.3. COMPLETENESS

6.3.2

149

Proposition.

Let (X, d) be a metric space and x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . .

a sequence of points in (X, d). If there exists a point a ∈ X , such that the
sequence converges to a, that is, xn → a, then the sequence is a Cauchy
sequence.

Proof.

Let ε be any positive real number. Put δ = ε/2. As xn → a, there exists

a positive integer n0 , such that for all n > n0 , d(xn , a) < δ .
So let m > n0 and n > n0 . Then d(xn , a) < δ and d(xm , a) < δ .
By the triangle inequality for metrics,

d(xm , xn ) ⩽ d(xm , a) + d(xn , a)
<δ+δ
=ε
and so the sequence is indeed a Cauchy sequence.



This naturally leads us to think about the converse statement and to ask if every
Cauchy sequence is a convergent sequence. The following example shows that this
is not true.
6.3.3

Example.

Consider the open interval (0, 1) with the euclidean metric d.

It is clear that the sequence 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, . . . is a Cauchy sequence but it
does not converge to any point in (0, 1).

6.3.4

Definition.



A metric space (X, d) is said to be complete if every

Cauchy sequence in (X, d) converges to a point in (X, d).

We immediately see from Example 6.3.3 that the unit interval (0,1) with the
euclidean metric is not a complete metric space. On the other hand, if X is any
finite set and d is the discrete metric on X , then obviously (X, d) is a complete
metric space.

150

CHAPTER 6. METRIC SPACES

We shall show that R with the euclidean metric is a complete metric space.
First we need to do some preparation.
As a shorthand, we shall denote the sequence x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . . , by {xn }.
6.3.5

Definition.

If {xn } is any sequence, then the sequence xn1 , xn2 , . . .

is said to be a subsequence if n1 < n2 < n3 < . . . .

6.3.6

Let {xn } be a sequence in R. Then it is said to be an

Definitions.

increasing sequence if xn ⩽ xn+1 , for all n ∈ N. It is said to be a decreasing
sequence if xn ⩾ xn+1 , for all n ∈ N. A sequence which is either increasing or
decreasing is said to be monotonic.
Most sequences are of course neither increasing nor decreasing.

6.3.7

Definition.

Let {xn } be a sequence in R. Then n0 ∈ N is said to

be a peak point if xn ⩽ xn0 , for every n ⩾ n0 .

6.3.8

Lemma.

Let {xn } be any sequence in R.

Then {xn } has a

monotonic subsequence.

Proof.

Assume firstly that the sequence {xn } has an infinite number of peak

points. Then choose a subsequence {xnk }, where each nk is a peak point. This
implies, in particular, that xnk ⩾ xnk+1 , for each k ∈ N; that is, {xnk } is a decreasing
subsequence of {xn }; so it is a monotonic subsequence.
Assume then that there are only a finite number of peak points. So there exists
an integer N , such that there are no peak points n > N . Choose any n1 > N . Then

n1 is not a peak point. So there is an n2 > n1 with xn2 > xn1 . Now n2 > N and so
it too is not a peak point. Hence there is an n3 > n2 , with xn3 > xn2 . Continuing
in this way (by mathematical induction), we produce a subsequence {xnk } of {xn }
with xnk < xnk+1 , for all k ∈ N; that is, {xnk } is an increasing subsequence of {xn }.
This completes the proof of the Lemma.


6.3. COMPLETENESS

6.3.9

Proposition.

151

Let {xn } be a monotonic sequence in R with the

euclidean metric. Then {xn } converges to a point in R if and only if {xn } is
bounded.

Proof.

Recall that “bounded” was defined in Remark 3.3.1.

Clearly if {xn } is unbounded, then it does not converge.
Assume then that {xn } is an increasing sequence which is bounded. By the
Least Upper Bound Axiom, there is a least upper bound L of the set {xn : n ∈ N}.
If ε is any positive real number, then there exists a positive integer N such that

d(xN , L) < ε; indeed, xN > L − ε.
But as {xn } is an increasing sequence and L is an upper bound, we have

L − ε < xn < L,

for all n > N .

That is xn → L.
The case that {xn } is a decreasing sequence which is bounded is proved in an



analogous fashion, which completes the proof.

As a corollary to Lemma 6.3.8 and Proposition 6.3.9, we obtain immediately
the following:

6.3.10

Theorem.

(Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem)

Every bounded

sequence in R with the euclidean metric has a convergent subsequence.



At long last we are able to prove that R with the euclidean metric is a complete
metric space.

152

CHAPTER 6. METRIC SPACES

6.3.11

Corollary.

The metric space R with the euclidean metric is a

complete metric space.

Proof.

Let {xn } be any Cauchy sequence in (R, d).

If we show that this arbitrary Cauchy sequence converges in R, we shall
have shown that the metric space is complete. The first step will be to
show that this sequence is bounded.

As {xn } is a Cauchy sequence, there exists a positive integer N , such that
for any n ⩾ N and m ⩾ N , d(xn , xm ) < 1; that is, |xn − xm | < 1. Put
M = |x1 | + |x2 | + · · · + |xN | + 1. Then |xn | < M, for all n ∈ N; that is, the
sequence {xn } is bounded.
So by the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem 6.3.10, this sequence has a convergent
subsequence; that is, there is an a ∈ R and a subsequence {xnk } with xnk → a.
We shall show that not only does the subsequence converge to a, but also
that the sequence {xn } itself converges to a.

Let ε be any positive real number. As {xn } is a Cauchy sequence, there exists
a positive integer N0 such that

|xn − xm | <

ε
,
2

for all m ⩾ N0 and n ⩾ N0 .

Since xnk → a, there exists a positive integer N1 , such that

|xnk − a| <

ε
,
2

for all nk ⩾ N1 .

So if we choose N2 = max{N0 , N1 }, combining the above two inequalities yields

|xn − a| ⩽ |xn − xnk | + |xnk − a|
ε ε
< + , for n > N2 and nk > N2
2 2
= ε.

6.3. COMPLETENESS

153

Hence xn → a, which completes the proof of the Corollary.

6.3.12

For each positive integer m, the metric space Rm with

the euclidean metric is a complete metric space.

Proof.

Let (X, d) be a metric space, Y a subset of X , and

d1 the metric induced on Y by d.
(i) If (X, d) is a complete metric space and Y is a closed subspace of (X, d),
then (Y, d1 ) is a complete metric space.
(ii) If (Y, d1 ) is a complete metric space, then Y is a closed subspace of (X, d).
.
Proof.

See Exercises 6.3 #5.

6.3.14

Remark.



Note that Example 6.3.3 showed that (0, 1) with the euclidean

metric is not a complete metric space. However, Corollary 6.3.11 showed that R with
the euclidean metric is a complete metric space. And we know that the topological
spaces (0, 1) and R are homeomorphic. So completeness is not preserved by
homeomorphism and so is not a topological property.

τ ) is said to be completely
metrizable if there exists a metric d on X such that τ is the topology on X

6.3.15

Definition.

A topological space (X,

determined by d and (X, d) is a complete metric space.

6.3.16

Remark.

Note that being completely metrizable is indeed a topological

property. Further, it is easy to verify (see Exercises 6.3 #7) that every discrete
space and every interval of R with the induced topology is completely metrizable.
So for a, b ∈ R with a < b, the topological spaces R, [a, b], (a, b), [a, b), (a, b],

(−∞, a), (−∞, a], (a, ∞), [a, ∞), and {a} with their induced topologies are all

154

CHAPTER 6. METRIC SPACES

completely metrizable. Somewhat surprisingly we shall see later that even the space

P of all irrational numbers with its induced topology is completely metrizable. Also
as (0, 1) is a completely metrizable subspace of R which is not a closed subset, we
see that Proposition 6.3.13(ii) would not be true if complete metric were replaced



by completely metrizable.

τ ) is said to be a Polish space

if it is separable and completely metrizable.
It is clear that R is a Polish space. By Exercises 6.3 #6, Rn is a Polish space,
for each positive integer n.

6.3.19

Definition.

A topological space (X,

τ ) is said to be a Souslin

space (or Suslin space) if it is Hausdorff and a continuous image of a Polish
space. If A is a subset of a topological space (Y,

τ 1) such that with the induced

τ 2, the space (A, τ 2) is a Souslin space, then A is said to be an
analytic set in (Y, τ 1 ).
topology

Obviously every Polish space is a Souslin 2 space. Exercises 6.1 #12 and #11
show that the converse is false as a Souslin space need not be metrizable. However,
we shall see that even a metrizable Souslin space is not necessarily a Polish space.
To see this we note that every countable topological space is a Souslin space
as it is a continuous image of the discrete space N; one such space is the metrizable
space Q which we shall see in Example 6.5.8 is not a Polish space.

Souslin is sometimes transliterated from Russian as Suslin. Andrei Suslin (1950– ) proved Serre’s
“conjecture” on algebraic vector bundles, as did Daniel Quillen (1940–2011). Jean-Pierre Serre
(1926– ) mentioned this problem in a paper in 1955.

6.3. COMPLETENESS

We know that two topological spaces are equivalent if they are homeomorphic.
It is natural to ask when are two metric spaces equivalent (as metric spaces)? The
relevant concept was introduced in Exercises 6.1 #10, namely that of isometric.

6.3.20

Definition.

Let (X, d) and (Y, d1 ) be metric spaces. Then (X, d)

is said to be isometric to (Y, d1 ) if there exists a surjective mapping f : X → Y
such that for all x1 and x2 in X , d(x1 , x2 ) = d1 (f (x1 ), f (x2 )). Such a mapping

f is said to be an isometry.
Let d be any metric on R and a any positive real number. If d1 is defined by

d1 (x, y) = a.d(x, y), for all x, y ∈ R, then it is easily shown that (R, d1 ) is a metric
space isometric to (R, d).
It is also easy to verify that any two isometric metric spaces have their associated
topological spaces homeomorphic and every isometry is also a homeomorphism of
the associated topological spaces.
6.3.21

Definition.

Let (X, d) and (Y, d1 ) be metric spaces and f a mapping

of X into Y . Let Z = f (X), and d2 be the metric induced on Z by d1 . If

f : (X, d) → (Z, d2 ) is an isometry, then f is said to be an isometric embedding
of (X, d) in (Y, d1 ).
Of course the natural embedding of Q with the euclidean metric in R with the
euclidean metric is an isometric embedding. It is also the case that N with the
euclidean metric has a natural isometric embedding into both R and Q with the
euclidean metric.
6.3.22

Definition.

Let (X, d) and (Y, d1 ) be metric spaces and f a mapping

of X into Y . If (Y, d1 ) is a complete metric space, f : (X, d) → (Y, d1 ) is
an isometric embedding and f (X) is a dense subset of Y in the associated
topological space, then (Y, d1 ) is said to be a completion of (X, d).
Clearly R with the euclidean metric is a completion of Q, the set of rationals
with the euclidean metric. Also R with the euclidean metric is a completion of I,

156

CHAPTER 6. METRIC SPACES

the set of irrationals with the euclidean metric. Two questions immediately jump to
mind: (1) Does every metric space have a completion? (2) Is the completion of a
metric space unique in some sense? We shall see that the answer to both questions
is “yes”.

Proposition.

If (X, d) is a metric space, then it has a completion.

Outline Proof. We begin by saying that two Cauchy sequences {yn } and {zn } in
(X, d) are equivalent if d(yn , zn ) → 0 in R. This is indeed an equivalence relation;

e be the set of all

Let ỹ and z̃ be any two points in X
{zn } ∈ z̃ . Now the sequence {d(yn , zn )} is a Cauchy sequence in R. (See Exercises
6.3 #8.) As R is a complete metric space, this Cauchy sequence in R converges to
some number, which we shall denote by d1 (ỹ, z̃). It is straightforward to show that
d1 (ỹ, z̃) is not dependent on the choice of the sequence {yn } in ỹ and {zn } in z̃ .
For each x ∈ X , the constant sequence x, x, . . . , x, . . . is a Cauchy sequence in
(X, d) converging to x. Let x̃ denote the equivalence class of all Cauchy sequences

e to be {x̃ : x ∈ X}. If d2 is

6.3.24

Proposition.

Let (A, d1 ) and (B, d2 ) be complete metric spaces.

Let X be a subset of (A, d1 ) with induced metric d3 , and Y a subset of (B, d2 )
with induced metric d4 . Further, let X be dense in (A, d1 ) and Y dense in

(B, d2 ). If there is an isometry f : (X, d3 ) → (Y, d4 ), then there exists an
isometry g : (A, d1 ) → (B, d2 ), such that g(x) = f (x), for all x ∈ X .
Let a ∈ A. As X is dense in (A, d1 ), there exists a sequence

Outline Proof.

xn → a, where each xn ∈ X . So {xn } is a Cauchy sequence. As f is an isometry,
{f (xn )} is a Cauchy sequence in (Y, d4 ) and hence also a Cauchy sequence in (B, d2 ).
Since (B, d2 ) is a complete metric space, there exists a b ∈ B , such that f (xn ) → b.
So we define g(a) = b.
To show that g is a well-defined map of A into B , it is necessary to verify that if

{zn } is any other sequence in X converging to a, then f (zn ) → b. This follows from
the fact that d1 (xn , zn ) → 0 and thus d2 (f (xn ), f (zn )) = d4 (f (xn ), f (zn )) → 0.
Next we need to show that g : A → B is one-to-one and onto. This is left as
an exercise as it is routine.
Finally, let a1 , a2 ∈ A and a1n → a1 and a2n → a2 , where each a1n and each

a2n is in X . Then
d1 (a1 , a2 ) = lim d3 (a1n , a2n ) = lim d4 (f (a1n ), f (a2n )) = d2 (g(a1 ), g(a2 ))
n→∞

n→∞

and so g is indeed an isometry, as required.



Proposition 6.3.24 says that, up to isometry, the completion of a metric spaces
is unique.
We conclude this section with another concept. Recall that in Example 6.1.9 we
introduced the concept of a normed vector space. We now define a very important
class of normed vector spaces.

6.3.25

Definition.

Let (N, || ||) be a normed vector space and d the

associated metric on the set N . Then (N, || ||) is said to be a Banach space
if (N, d) is a complete metric space.

6.3. COMPLETENESS

6.3.26

Example.

159

In Exercises 6.1 #7 and #8 we introduced the metric spaces

(`1 , d1 ), (`2 , d2 ), (`∞ , d∞ ), and (c0 , d0 ) and recorded that each can be made into
a normed vector space in a natural way. We use the notation `1 , `∞ , `2 and c0 to
denote these normed spaces. Indeed each of these is a Banach space, and `1 , `2 ,
and c0 are separable Banach spaces. (See Exercises 6.3 #11.)
From Proposition 6.3.23 we know that every normed vector space has a
completion. However, the rather pleasant feature is that this completion is in fact
also a normed vector space and so is a Banach space. (See Exercises 6.3 #12.)

Deduce from Exercise 14 above that if (X, d) is a separable metric space, and

d1 is the metric induced on a subset Y of X by d, then (Y, d1 ) is separable; in
other words every subspace of a separable metric space is separable. (It
should be noted that it is not necessarily true that a subspace of a separable
topological space is separable.)

6.4

Contraction Mappings

In Chapter 5 we had our first glimpse of a fixed point theorem. In this section we shall
meet another type of fixed point theorem. This section is very much part of metric
space theory rather than general topology. Nevertheless the topic is important for
applications.

6.4.1

Definition.

Let f be a mapping of a set X into itself. Then a point

x ∈ X is said to be a fixed point of f if f (x) = x.

6.4.2

Definition.

Let (X, d) be a metric space and f a mapping of X into

itself. Then f is said to be a contraction mapping if there exists an r ∈ (0, 1),
such that

d(f (x1 ), f (x2 )) ⩽ r.d(x1 , x2 ),

for all x1 , x2 ∈ X .

Let f be a contraction mapping of the metric space

(X, d). Then f is a continuous mapping.

Proof.

See Exercises 6.4 #1.

162

CHAPTER 6. METRIC SPACES

6.4.4

Theorem.

(Contraction Mapping Theorem or Banach Fixed

Point Theorem)

Let (X, d) be a complete metric space and f a contraction

mapping of (X, d) into itself. Then f has precisely one fixed point.

Proof.

Let x be any point in X and consider the sequence

x, f (x), f 2 (x) = f (f (x)), f 3 (x) = f (f (f (x))), . . . , f n (x), . . . .
We shall show this is a Cauchy sequence. Put a = d(x, f (x)). As f is a contraction
mapping, there exists r ∈ (0, 1), such that d(f (x1 ), f (x2 )) ⩽ r.d(x1 , x2 ),

for all x1 , x2 ∈ X .

Clearly d(f (x), f 2 (x)) ⩽ r.d(x, f (x)) = r.a, d(f 2 (x), f 3 (x)) ⩽ r 2 .d(x, f (x)) =
r2 .a, and by induction we obtain that, for each k ∈ N, d(f k (x), f k+1 (x)) ⩽

rk .d(x, f (x)) = rk .a.
Let m and n be any positive integers, with n > m. Then

d(f m (x), f n (x)) = d(f m (x), f m (f n−m (x)))
⩽ rm .d(x, f n−m (x))
⩽ rm .[d(x, f (x)) + d(f (x), f 2 (x)) + · · · + d(f n−m−1 (x), f n−m (x))]
⩽ rm .d(x, f (x))[1 + r + r2 + · · · + rn−m−1 ]
rm .a

⩽
1−r
As r < 1, it is clear that {f n (x)} is a Cauchy sequence. Since (X, d) is complete,
there is a z ∈ X , such that f n (x) → z .
By Proposition 6.4.3, f is continuous and so

f (z) = f

lim f n (x)

(6.1)

and so z is indeed a fixed point of f .
Finally, let t be any fixed point of f . Then

d(t, z) = d(f (t), f (z)) ⩽ r.d(t, z).

(6.2)

As r < 1, this implies d(t, z) = 0 and thus t = z and f has only one fixed point. 

6.4. CONTRACTION MAPPINGS

163

It is worth mentioning that the Contraction Mapping Theorem provides not only
an existence proof of a fixed point but also a construction for finding it; namely,
let x be any point in X and find the limit of the sequence {f n (x)}. This method
allows us to write a computer program to approximate the limit point to any desired
accuracy.

Exercises 6.4
1. Prove Proposition 6.4.3.
2. Extend the Contraction Mapping Theorem 6.4.4 by showing that if f is a
mapping of a complete metric space (X, d) into itself and f N is a contraction
mapping for some positive integer N , then f has precisely one fixed point.
Mean Value Theorem
3. The Mean Value Theorem says: Let f be a real-valued function on a closed
unit interval [a, b] which is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b).
Then there exists a point c ∈ [a, b] such that f (b) − f (a) = f 0 (c)(b − a).
(Recall that f is said to be differentiable at a point s if lim
x→s
exists.)

f (x)−f (s)
= f 0 (s)
x−s

Using the Mean Value Theorem prove the following:
Let f : [a, b] → [a, b] be differentiable. Then f is a contraction if and only if
there exists r ∈ (0, 1) such that |f 0 (x)| ⩽ r , for all x ∈ [a, b].
4. Using Exercises 3 and 2 above, show that while f : R → R given by

f (x) = cos x does not satisfy the conditions of the Contraction Mapping
Theorem, it nevertheless has a unique fixed point.

Theorem.

(Baire Category Theorem)

Let (X, d) be a complete

metric space. If X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn , . . . is a sequence of open dense subsets of X ,
T
then the set ∞
n=1 Xn is also dense in X .

Proof.
It suffices to show that if U is any non-empty open subset of (X, d), then
T∞
U ∩ n=1 Xn 6= Ø.
As X1 is open and dense in X , the set U ∩ X1 is a non-empty open subset of

(X, d). Let U1 be an open ball of radius at most 1, such that U1 ⊂ U ∩ X1 .
Inductively define for each positive integer n > 1, an open ball Un of radius at
most 1/n such that Un ⊂ Un−1 ∩ Xn .
For each positive integer n, let xn be any point in Un . Clearly the sequence

{xn } is a Cauchy sequence. As (X, d) is a complete metric space, this sequence
converges to a point x ∈ X .
Observe that for every positive integer m and each n > m, the point xn is in
the closed set U m , and so the limit point x is also in the set U m .

Then x ∈ Un , for all n ∈ N. Thus x ∈ ∞

But as U ∩ n=1 Xn ⊃ n=1 Un 3 x, this implies that U ∩ ∞

In Exercises 3.2 #5 we introduced the notion of interior of a subset of a
topological space. We now formally define that term as well as exterior and boundary.

6.5.2

Definitions.

Let (X,

τ ) be any topological space and A any subset

of X . The largest open set contained in A is called the interior of A and is
denoted by Int(A). Each point x ∈ Int(A) is called an interior point of A.
The set Int(X \ A), that is the interior of the complement of A, is denoted by
Ext(A), and is called the exterior of A and each point in Ext(A) is called an
exterior point of A. The set A \ Int(A) is called the boundary of A. Each
point in the boundary of A is called a boundary point of A.

6.5. BAIRE SPACES

165

In Definitions 6.5.2, the set X is the union of the interior of A, the exterior of

A, and the boundary of A, and each of these three sets is disjoint from each of the
other two sets.

6.5.3

Definition.

A subset A of a topological space (X,

τ ) is said to be

nowhere dense if the set A has empty interior.

These definitions allow us to rephrase Theorem 6.5.1.

(Baire Category Theorem)

Let (X, d) be a complete

metric space. If X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn , . . . is a sequence of subsets of X such that

n=1 Xn , then for at least one n ∈ N, the set Xn has non-empty interior;
that is, Xn is not nowhere dense.

It is important to note that Corollary 6.5.6 is a result in

Note also that there are Baire spaces which are not completely metrizable. (See
Exercises 6.5 #6(iv).)

166

CHAPTER 6. METRIC SPACES

6.5.8

Example.

The topological space Q is not a Baire space and so is not

completely metrizable. To see this, note that the set of rational numbers is countable
and let

Q = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . . }. Each of the sets Xn = Q \ {xn } is open and dense in Q,
T
however ∞

n=1 Xn = Ø. Thus Q does not have the Baire space property.

6.5.9

Remark.

You should note that (once we had the Baire Category Theorem

6.5.4) it was harder to prove that Q is not completely metrizable than the more
general result that Q is not a Baire space.
It is a surprising and important feature not only of topology, but of mathematics
generally, that a more general result is sometimes easier to prove.

6.5.10

Definitions.

Let Y be a subset of a topological space (X,



τ ). If

Y is a union of a countable number of nowhere dense subsets of X , then Y is
said to be a set of the first category or meager in (X, τ ). If Y is not first
category, it is said to be a set of the second category in (X, τ ).
The Baire Category Theorem 6.5.4 has many applications in analysis, but these
lie outside our study of Topology. However, we shall conclude this section with an
important theorem in Banach space theory, namely the Open Mapping Theorem.
This theorem is a consequence of the Baire Category Theorem 6.5.4.

union of nowhere dense sets.

Let S be a subset of a real vector space V . The set S

Clearly every subspace of a vector space is convex. Also in any normed vector

Clearly B =

n=1
As B1 is a Banach space, by Corollary 6.5.4 of the Baire Category Theorem,
there is an N ∈ N, such that L(BN (0)) has non-empty interior.
So there is a z ∈ B1 and t > 0, such that Bt (z)) ⊆ L(BN (0)).
By Exercises 6.5 #3 there is no loss of generality in assuming that z ∈ L(BN (0)).
But Bt (z) = Bt (0) + z , and so

Bt (0) ⊆ L(BN (0)) − z = L(BN (0)) − z ⊆ L(BN (0)) − L(BN (0)) ⊆ L(B2N (0)).
which, by the linearity of L, implies that Bt/2 (0) ⊆ L(BN (0)).
We shall show that this implies that Bt/4 (0) ⊆ L(BN (0)).
Let w ∈ Bt/2 (0). Then there is an x1 ∈ BN (0), such that ||w − L(x1 )||1 < 4t .
Note that by linearity of the mapping L, for each integer k > 0

Bt/2 (0) ⊆ L(BN (0)) =⇒ Bt/(2k) (0) ⊆ L(BN/k (0)).
So there is an x2 ∈ BN/2 (0), such that

t

Continuing in this way, we obtain by induction a sequence {xm } such that
N and
||xm || < 2m−1
t
||w − L(x1 + x2 + · · · + xm )||1 = ||w − L(x1 ) − L(x2 ) − · · · − L(xm )||1 < m .

P∞
Since B is complete, the series
m=1 xm converges to a limit a.
||(w − L(x1 )) − L(x2 )||1 = ||w − L(x1 ) − L(x2 )||1 <

Clearly ||a|| < 2N and by continuity of L, we have w = L(a) ∈ L(B2N (0)).
So Bt/2 (0) ⊆ L(B2N (0)) and thus Bt/4 (0) ⊆ L(BN (0)) which completes the
proof.

Metric space theory is an important topic in its own right. As well, metric spaces
hold an important position in the study of topology. Indeed many books on topology
begin with metric spaces, and motivate the study of topology via them.
We saw that different metrics on the same set can give rise to the same topology.
Such metrics are called equivalent metrics. We were introduced to the study of
function spaces, and in particular, C[0, 1]. En route we met normed vector spaces,
a central topic in functional analysis.
Not all topological spaces arise from metric spaces. We saw this by observing
that topologies induced by metrics are Hausdorff.
We saw that the topology of a metric space can be described entirely in terms
of its convergent sequences and that continuous functions between metric spaces
can also be so described.
Exercises 6.2 #9 introduced the interesting concept of distance between sets in
a metric space.

174

CHAPTER 6. METRIC SPACES

We met the concepts of Cauchy sequence, complete metric space, completely
metrizable space, Banach space, Polish space, and Souslin space. Completeness is
an important topic in metric space theory because of the central role it plays in
applications in analysis. Banach spaces are complete normed vector spaces and are
used in many contexts in analysis and have a rich structure theory. We saw that
every metric space has a completion, that is can be embedded isometrically in a
complete metric space. For example every normed vector space has a completion
which is a Banach space.
Contraction mappings were introduced in the concept of fixed points and we
saw the proof of the Contraction Mapping Theorem 6.4.4 which is also known as
the Banach Fixed Point Theorem 6.4.4. This is a very useful theorem in applications
for example in the proof of existence of solutions of differential equations.
Another powerful theorem proved in this chapter was the Baire Category
Theorem 6.5.1. We introduced the topological notion of a Baire space and saw
that every completely metrizable space is a Baire space. En route the notion of
first category or meager was introduced. And then we proved the Open Mapping
Theorem 6.5.15 which says that a continuous linear map from a Banach space onto
another Banach space must be an open mapping.

Chapter 7

Compactness
Introduction
The most important topological property is compactness.

It plays a key role in

many branches of mathematics. It would be fair to say that until you understand
compactness you do not understand topology!
So what is compactness? It could be described as the topologists generalization
of finiteness.

The formal definition says that a topological space is compact if

whenever it is a subset of a union of an infinite number of open sets then it is also a
subset of a union of a finite number of these open sets. Obviously every finite subset
of a topological space is compact. And we quickly see that in a discrete space a set
is compact if and only if it is finite. When we move to topological spaces with richer
topological structures, such as R, we discover that infinite sets can be compact.
Indeed all closed intervals [a, b] in R are compact. But intervals of this type are the
only ones which are compact.
So we are led to ask: precisely which subsets of R are compact? The HeineBorel Theorem 7.2.9 will tell us that the compact subsets of R are precisely the sets
which are both closed and bounded.
As we go farther into our study of topology, we shall see that compactness plays
a crucial role. This is especially so of applications of topology to analysis.

CHAPTER 7. COMPACTNESS

7.1

Compact Spaces

7.1.1

Let A be a subset of a topological space (X,

Definition.

τ ). Then

A is said to be compact if for every set I and every family of open sets, Oi ,
S
i ∈ I , such that A ⊆ i∈I Oi there exists a finite subfamily Oi1 , Oi2 . . . . , Oin
such that A ⊆ Oi1 ∪ Oi2 ∪ · · · ∪ Oin .

7.1.2

Example.

If (X,

τ ) = R and A = (0, ∞), then A is not compact.

For each positive integer i, let Oi be the open interval (0, i).
S
clearly, A ⊆ ∞
i=1 Oi .
Proof.

Then,

But there do not exist i1 , i2 , . . . in such that A ⊆ (0, i1 ) ∪ (0, i2 ) ∪ · · · ∪ (0, in ).
Therefore A is not compact.



Let (X,

τ ) be any topological space and A = {x1, x2, . . . , xn}

7.1.3

Example.

any finite subset of (X,

τ ). Then A is compact.

Let Oi , i ∈ I , be any family of open sets such that A ⊆

S

i∈I Oi . Then for
each xj ∈ A, there exists an Oij , such that xj ∈ Oij . Thus A ⊆ Oi1 ∪Oi2 ∪· · ·∪Oin .

Proof.

So A is compact.

7.1.4

Remark.


So we see from Example 7.1.3 that every finite set (in a

topological space) is compact.

Indeed “compactness” can be thought of as a



topological generalization of “finiteness”.

7.1.5

Example.

A subset A of a discrete space (X,

τ ) is compact if and only

if it is finite.
Proof.

If A is finite then Example 7.1.3 shows that it is compact.

Conversely, let A be compact. Then the family of singleton sets Ox = {x}, x ∈ A
is such that each Ox is open and A ⊆

S

x∈A Ox . As A is compact, there exist
Ox1 , Ox2 , . . . , Oxn such that A ⊆ Ox1 ∪ Ox2 ∪ · · · ∪ Oxn ; that is, A ⊆ {x1 , . . . , xn }.
Hence A is a finite set.



7.1. COMPACT SPACES

177

Of course if all compact sets were finite then the study of “compactness” would
not be interesting. However we shall see shortly that, for example, every closed
interval [a, b] is compact. Firstly, we introduce a little terminology.

7.1.6

Definitions.

Let I be a set and Oi , i ∈ I , a family of subset of

X . Let A be a subset of X . Then Oi , i ∈ I , is said to be a covering (or
S
a cover) of X if A ⊆ i∈I Oi . If each Oi , i ∈ I , is an open set in (X, τ ),
S
then Oi , i ∈ I is saisd to be an open covering of A if A ⊆ i∈I Oi . A finite
subfamily, Oi1 , Oi2 , . . . , Oin , of Oi , i ∈ I , is called a finite subcovering (of A)
if A ⊆ Oi1 ∪ Oi2 ∪ · · · ∪ Oin .
So we can rephrase the definition of compactness as follows:

7.1.7

Definitions.

A subset A of a topological space (X,

τ ) is said to be

compact if every open covering of A has a finite subcovering. If the compact
subset A equals X , then (X,

7.1.8

Remark.

τ ) is said to be a compact space.

We leave as an exercise the verification of the following

statement:

τ ) and τ 1 the topology induced on A by τ . Then
A is a compact subset of (X, τ ) if and only if (A, τ 1 ) is a compact space.

Let A be a subset of (X,

[This statement is not as trivial as it may appear at first sight.]



CHAPTER 7. COMPACTNESS

7.1.9

Proof.

The closed interval [0, 1] is compact.

Proposition.

Let Oi , i ∈ I be any open covering of [0, 1]. Then for each x ∈ [0, 1],

there is an Oi such that x ∈ Oi . As Oi is open about x, there exists an interval Ux ,
open in [0, 1] such that x ∈ Ux ⊆ Oi .
Now define a subset S of [0, 1] as follows:

S = {z : [0, z] can be covered by a finite number of the sets Ux }.
[So z ∈ S ⇒ [0, z] ⊆ Ux1 ∪ Ux2 ∪ · · · ∪ Uxn , for some x1 , x2 , . . . , xn .]
Now let x ∈ S and y ∈ Ux . Then as Ux is an interval containing x and y ,

[x, y] ⊆ Ux . (Here we are assuming, without loss of generality that x ⩽ y.) So
[0, y] ⊆ Ux1 ∪ Ux2 ∪ · · · ∪ Uxn ∪ Ux
and hence y ∈ S .
So for each x ∈ [0, 1], Ux ∩ S = Ux or Ø.
This implies that

S=

[

Ux

x∈S
and

[0, 1] \ S =

[

Ux .

x∈S
/
Thus we have that S is open in [0, 1] and S is closed in [0, 1]. But [0, 1] is connected.
Therefore S = [0, 1] or Ø.
However 0 ∈ S and so S = [0, 1]; that is, [0, 1] can be covered by a finite number
of Ux . So [0, 1] ⊆ Ux1 ∪ Ux2 ∪ . . . Uxm . But each Uxi is contained in an Oi , i ∈ I .
Hence [0, 1] ⊆ Oi1 ∪ Oi2 ∪ · · · ∪ Oim and we have shown that [0, 1] is compact.

Then f −1 (Y ) ⊆ f −1 ( i∈I Oi ); that is, X ⊆ i∈I f −1 (Oi ).
So f −1 (Oi ), i ∈ I , is an open covering of X .

Proof.

S

i∈I Oi .

As X is compact, there exist i1 , i2 , . . . , in in I such that

X ⊆ f −1 (Oi1 ) ∪ f −1 (Oi2 ) ∪ · · · ∪ f −1 (Oin ).
So

Y = f (X)
⊆ f (f −1 (Oi1 ) ∪ f −1 (Oi2 ) ∪ · · · ∪ f −1 (Oin ))
= f (f −1 (Oi1 ) ∪ f (f −1 (Oi2 )) ∪ · · · ∪ f (f −1 (Oin ))

= Oi1 ∪ Oi2 ∪ · · · ∪ Oin , since f is surjective.

is not compact.

Proof.

The space [a, b] is homeomorphic to the compact space [0, 1] and so, by

Proposition 7.2.1, is compact.
The space (a, b) is homeomorphic to (0, ∞). If (a, b) were compact, then (0, ∞)
would be compact, but we saw in Example 7.1.2 that (0, ∞) is not compact. Hence

(a, b) is not compact.

7.2.4

Proof.



Proposition.

Every closed subset of a compact space is compact.

Let A be a closed subset of a compact space (X,

τ ). Let Ui ∈ τ , i ∈ I ,

be any open covering of A. Then

X⊆(

[

Ui ) ∪ (X \ A);

i∈I
that is, Ui , i ∈ I , together with the open set X \ A is an open covering of X .
Therefore there exists a finite subcovering Ui1 , Ui2 , . . . , Uik , X \ A. [If X \ A is not
in the finite subcovering then we can include it and still have a finite subcovering of

X .]
So

X ⊆ Ui1 ∪ Ui2 ∪ · · · ∪ Uik ∪ (X \ A).
Therefore,

A ⊆ Ui1 ∪ Ui2 ∪ · · · ∪ Uik ∪ (X \ A)
which clearly implies

A ⊆ Ui1 ∪ Ui2 ∪ · · · ∪ Uik
since A ∩ (X \ A) = Ø. Hence A has a finite subcovering and so is compact.

CHAPTER 7. COMPACTNESS

7.2.5

Proposition.

A compact subset of a Hausdorff topological space is

closed.

Proof.

Let A be a compact subset of the Hausdorff space (X,

τ ). We shall show

that A contains all its limit points and hence is closed. Let p ∈ X \A. Then for each

a ∈ A, there exist open sets Ua and Va such that a ∈ Ua , p ∈ Va and Ua ∩ Va = Ø.
S
Then A ⊆ a∈A Ua . As A is compact, there exist a1 , a2 , . . . , an in A such that
A ⊆ Ua1 ∪ Ua2 ∪ · · · ∪ Uan .
S
· · · Uan and V = Va1 ∩ Va2 ∩ · · · ∩ Van . Then p ∈ V and
Va ∩ Ua = Ø implies V ∩ U = Ø which in turn implies V ∩ A = Ø. So p is not a
limit point of A, and V is an open set containing p which does not intersect A.

Put U = Ua1

S

U a2

S

Hence A contains all of its limit points and is therefore closed.

7.2.6

7.2.7

Corollary.

Example.

A compact subset of a metrizable space is closed.



For a and b in R with a < b, the intervals [a, b) and (a, b] are

not compact as they are not closed subsets of the metrizable space R.

7.2.8



Proposition.



A compact subset of R is bounded.

Let A ⊆ R be unbounded. Then A ⊆

S∞

n=1 (−n, n), but {(−n, n) : n =
1, 2, 3, . . . } does not have any finite subcovering of A as A is unbounded. Therefore

Proof.

A is not compact. Hence all compact subsets of R are bounded.
7.2.9

Theorem.

(Heine-Borel Theorem)



Every closed bounded subset

of R is compact.
Proof.

If A is a closed bounded subset of R, then A ⊆ [a, b], for some a and b in

R. As [a, b] is compact and A is a closed subset, A is compact.

7.2. THE HEINE-BOREL THEOREM

The Heine-Borel Theorem 7.2.9 is an important result. The proof above is short
only because we extracted and proved Proposition 7.1.9 first.

7.2.10

Proposition.

Every

compact subset of R is closed and bounded.

Proof.

This follows immediately from Propositions 7.2.8 and 7.2.5.

7.2.11



A subset A of a metric space (X, d) is said to be

bounded if there exists a real number r such that d(a1 , a2 ) ⩽ r , for all a1 and

a2 in A.

7.2.12

Proposition.

Let A be a compact subset of a metric space (X, d).

Then A is closed and bounded.

Proof.

By Corollary 7.2.6, A is a closed set. Now fix x0 ∈ X and define the

mapping f : (A,

τ ) → R by
f (a) = d(a, x0 ), for every a ∈ A,

where

τ is the induced topology on A. Then f is continuous and so, by Proposition

7.2.1, f (A) is compact. Thus, by Proposition 7.2.10, f (A) is bounded; that is,
there exists a real number M such that

f (a) ⩽ M, for all a ∈ A.
Thus d(a, x0 ) ⩽ M , for all a ∈ A. Putting r = 2M , we see by the triangle inequality
that d(a1 , a2 ) ⩽ r , for all a1 and a2 in A.

Recalling that Rn denotes the n-dimensional euclidean space with the topology

As f is continuous, f (X) is compact. Therefore f (X) is a closed bounded

subset of R. As f (X) is bounded, it has a supremum. Since f (X) is closed, Lemma

Proposition.

Let a and b be in R and f a continuous function from

[a, b] into R. Then f ([a, b]) = [c, d], for some c and d in R.

Proof.

As [a, b] is connected, f ([a, b]) is a connected subset of R and hence is an

interval. As [a, b] is compact, f ([a, b]) is compact. So f ([a, b]) is a closed bounded
interval. Hence

f ([a, b]) = [c, d]
for some c and d in R.

Convergent Sequences
18. In Definitions 6.2.1 we defined the notion of a convergent sequence in a metric
space. We now generalize this to a convergent sequence in a topological space.
Let (X,

τ ) be a topological space and x1, x2, . . . xn . . . be a sequence of points

in X . Then the sequence is said to converge to x if, for each open set U
in (X,

τ ), there exists an N ∈ N such that xn ∈ U , for every n ⩾ N ; this is

denoted by xn → x. The sequence y1 , y2 , . . . , yn , . . . of points in X is said to
be convergent if there exists a pont y ∈ Y such that yn → y .

CHAPTER 7. COMPACTNESS

7.3

Postscript

Compactness plays a key role in applications of topology to all branches of analysis.
As noted in Remark 7.1.4 it can be thought as a topological generalization of
finiteness.
The Generalized Heine-Borel Theorem 7.2.13 characterizes the compact subsets
of Rn as those which are closed and bounded.
Compactness is a topological property.

Indeed any continuous image of a

compact space is compact.
Closed subsets of compact spaces are compact and compact subspaces of
Hausdorff spaces are closed.
Exercises 7.2 #5 introduces the notions of open mappings and closed mappings.
Exercises 7.2 #10 notes that a compact Hausdorff space is a normal space (indeed a
T4 -space). That the closed unit ball in each Rn is compact contrasts with Exercises
7.2 #9. This exercise points out that the closed unit ball in the metric space
(C[0, 1], d∗ ) is not compact. Though we shall not prove it here, it can be shown
that a normed vector space is finite-dimensional if and only if its closed unit ball is
compact.
In Exercise 7.2 #17, 19 and 20 the concepts of countably compact, sequentially
compact and pseudocompact are introduced and in Exercise 7.2 #22 they are shown
to be equivalent to the concept of compact for metrizable spaces.
Warning.

It is unfortunate that “compact” is defined in different ways in different

books and some of these are not equivalent to the definition presented here. Firstly
some books include Hausdorff in the definition of compact and use quasicompact
to denote what we have called compact. Some books, particularly older ones, use
“compact” to mean sequentially compact. Finally the term “bikompakt” is often
used to mean compact or compact Hausdorff in our sense. So one needs to be
careful to see what the author actually means.

Chapter 8

Finite Products
Introduction
There are three important ways of creating new topological spaces from old ones.
They are by forming “subspaces”, “quotient spaces”, and “product spaces”. The
next three chapters are devoted to the study of product spaces. Quotient spaces are
dealt with in Chapter 11. In this chapter we investigate finite products and prove
Tychonoff ’s Theorem. This seemingly innocuous theorem says that any product of
compact spaces is compact. So we are led to ask: precisely which subsets of Rn ,

n ∈ N, are compact? The Generalized Heine-Borel Theorem 8.3.3 will tell us that
the compact subsets of Rn are precisely the sets which are both closed and bounded.
As we go farther into our study of topology, we shall see that compactness plays
a crucial role. This is especially so of applications of topology to analysis.

CHAPTER 8. FINITE PRODUCTS

8.1

The Product Topology

If X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn are sets then the product X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn is the set consisting
of all the ordered n-tuples hx1 , x2 . . . , xn i, where xi ∈ Xi , i = 1, . . . , n.
The problem we now discuss is:

τ

τ

τ

Given topological spaces (X1 , 1 ), (X2 , 2 ), . . . , (Xn , n ) how do we define a
reasonable topology
on the product set X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn ?

τ

An obvious (but incorrect!) candidate for

τ is the set of all sets O1 × O2 × · · · × On,

τ i, i = 1, . . . , n. Unfortunately this is not a topology.
For example, if n = 2 and (X, T1 ) = (X, τ 2 ) = R then τ would contain the
where Oi ∈

rectangles (0, 1) × (0, 1) and (2, 3) × (2, 3) but not the set [(0, 1) × (0, 1)] ∪ [(2, 3) ×

(2, 3)], since this is not O1 × O2 for any choice of O1 and O2 .
[If it were O1 × O2 for some O1 and O2 , then 21 ∈ (0, 1) ⊆ O1 and 2 12 ∈ (2, 3) ⊆ O2
and so the ordered pair h 12 , 2 12 i ∈ O1 ×O2 but h 21 , 2 12 i ∈
/ [(0, 1)×(0, 1)]∪[(2, 3)×(2, 3)].]
Thus
is not closed under unions and so is not a topology.

τ

However we have already seen how to put a topology (the euclidean topology)
on R2 = R × R. This was done in Example 2.2.9. Indeed this example suggests how
to define the product topology in general.

τ 1), (X2, τ 2), . . . , (Xn, τ n) be topological
spaces. Then the product topology τ on the set X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn is the
topology having the family {O1 × O2 × · · · × On , Oi ∈ τ i , i = 1, . . . , n} as
a basis. The set X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn with the topology τ is said to be the
product of the spaces (X1 , τ 1 ), (X2 , τ 2 ), . . . , (Xn , τ n ) and is denoted by
(X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn , τ ) or (X1 , τ 1 ) × (X2 , τ 2 ) × · · · × (Xn , τ n ).
8.1.1

Definitions.

Let (X1 ,

Of course it must be verified that
the family {O1 × O2 × · · · × On : Oi ∈

τ i, i = 1, . . . , n} is a basis for a topology;

that is, it satisfies the conditions of Proposition 2.2.8. (This is left as an exercise.)

Let B1 , B2 , . . . , Bn be bases for the topological spaces

(X1 , τ 1 ), (X2 , τ 2 ), . . . , (Xn , τ n ), respectively. Then the family of sets
{O1 × O2 × · · · × On : Oi ∈ Bi , i = 1, . . . , n} is a basis for the product topology
on X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn .
The proof of Proposition 8.1.2 is straightforward and is also left as an exercise
for you.
We now see that the euclidean topology on Rn , n ⩾ 2,
is just the product topology on the set R × R × · · · × R = Rn . (See Example 2.2.9
8.1.3

Observations

and Remark 2.2.10.)
(ii)

It is clear from Definitions 8.1.1 that any product of open sets is an open

set or more precisely: if O1 , O2 , . . . , On are open subsets of topological spaces

(X1 , τ 1 ), (X2 , τ 2 ), . . . , (Xn , τ n ), respectively, then O1 × O2 × · · · × On is an open
subset of (X1 , τ 1 ) × (X2 , τ 2 ) × · · · × (Xn , τ n ). The next proposition says that any
product of closed sets is a closed set.

Let C1 , C2 , . . . , Cn be closed subsets of the topological

· · · ∪ [X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn−1 × (Xn \ Cn )]
which is a union of open sets (as a product of open sets is open) and so is an open set
in (X1 ,

τ 1)×(X2, τ 2)×· · ·×(Xn, τ n). Therefore its complement, C1 ×C2 ×· · ·×Cn,

is a closed set, as required.

than τ 1 ) if τ 1 ⊇ τ 2 .

hx1 , x2 , . . . , xi , . . . , xn i ∈ X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn . Then

For each i

(i) each pi is a continuous surjective open mapping, and
(ii)

τ is the coarsest topology on the set X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn such that each
pi is continuous.

Proof.
Clearly each pi is surjective. To see that each pi is continuous, let U be
any open set in (Xi , i ). Then

which is a product of open sets and so is open in (X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn ,

each pi is continuous.
To show that pi is an open mapping it suffices to verify that for each basic open set

U1 × U2 × · · · × Un , where Uj is open in (Xj , τ j ), for j = 1, . . . , n, the set
pi (U1 × U2 × · · · × Un ) is open in (Xi , τ i ). But pi (U1 × U2 × · · · × Un ) = Ui
which is, of course, open in (Xi , τ i ). So each pi is an open mapping. We have now
verified part (i) of the proposition.
Now let 0 be any topology on the set X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn such that each
projection mapping pi : (X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn , 0 ) → (Xi , i ) is continuous. We have
to show that 0 ⊇ T .

CHAPTER 8. FINITE PRODUCTS

Remark.

Proposition 8.2.5 (ii) gives us another way of defining the

product topology. Given topological spaces (X1 ,

τ 1), (X2, τ 2), . . . , (Xn, τ n)

the product topology can be defined as the coarsest topology on X1 × X2 × · · · × X
such that each projection pi : X1 × X2 × . . . Xn → Xi is continuous. This
observation will be of greater significance in the next section when we proceed to a
discussion of products of an infinite number of topological spaces.

Proposition.

Let (X1 ,

201

τ 1), (X2, τ 2), . . . , (Xn, Tn) be topological

spaces

and

(X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn , τ ) the product space.
Then each (Xi , τ i ) is
homeomorphic to a subspace of (X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn , τ ).
Proof.

For each j , let aj be any (fixed) element in Xj . For each i, define a

mapping

fi : (Xi , τ i ) → (X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn , τ ) by
fi (x) = ha1 , a2 , . . . , ai−1 , x, ai+1 , . . . , an i.

τ i) → (fi(Xi), τ 0) is a homeomorphism, where τ 0 is the
topology induced on fi (Xi ) by τ . Clearly this mapping is one-to-one and onto. Let
U ∈ τ i . Then

We claim that fi : (Xi ,

fi (U ) = {a1 } × {a2 } × · · · × {ai−1 } × U × {ai+1 } × · · · × {an }
= (X1 × X2 × · · · × Xi−1 × U × Xi+1 × · · · × Xn ) ∩
({a1 } × {a2 } × · · · × {ai−1 } × Xi × {ai+1 } × · · · × {an })
= (X1 × X2 × · · · × Xi−1 × U × Xi+1 × · · · × Xn ) ∩ fi (Xi )
∈ τ0
since X1 × X2 × · · · × Xi−1 × U × Xi+1 × · · · × Xn ∈ τ . So U ∈ τ i implies that
fi (U ) ∈ τ 0 .
Finally, observe that the family

{(U1 × U2 × · · · × Un ) ∩ fi (Xi ) : Ui ∈ Ti , i = 1, . . . , n}

τ

is a basis for 0 , so to prove that fi is continuous it suffices to verify that the
inverse image under fi of every member of this family is open in (Xi , i ). But

As Ui ∩ Xi = Ui ∈

Tychonoff ’s Theorem for Finite Products

8.3.1

Theorem.

(X1 , τ 1 ), (X2 , τ

(Tychonoff ’s Theorem for Finite Products) If
Qn
2 ), . . . , (Xn , n ) are compact spaces, then
i=1 (Xi , i ) is a

τ

τ

compact space.
Proof.

Consider first the product of two compact spaces (X,

τ 1) and (Y, τ 2).

Let Ui , i ∈ I be any open covering of X ×Y . Then for each x ∈ X and y ∈ Y , there
exists an i ∈ I such that hx, yi ∈ Ui . So there is a basic open set V (x, y) × W (x, y),
such that V hx, yi ∈

τ 1, W (x, y) ∈ τ 2 and hx, yi ∈ V (x, y) × W (x, y) ⊆ Ui.

As hx, yi ranges over all points of X × Y we obtain an open covering V (x, y) ×

W (x, y), x ∈ X, y ∈ Y , of X × Y such that each V (x, y) × W (x, y) is a subset of
some Ui , i ∈ I . Thus to prove (X, τ 1 ) × (Y, τ 2 ) is compact it suffices to find a
finite subcovering of the open covering V (x, y) × W (x, y), x ∈ X , y ∈ Y .
Now fix x0 ∈ X and consider the subspace {x0 } × Y of X × Y . As seen in
Proposition 8.2.8 this subspace is homeomorphic to (Y,

τ 2) and so is compact.

As V (x0 , y) × W (x0 , y), y ∈ Y , is an open covering of {x0 } × Y it has a finite
subcovering:

V (x0 , y1 ) × W (x0 , y1 ), V (x0 , y2 ) × W (x0 , y2 ), . . . , V (x0 , ym ) × W (x0 , ym ).
Put V (x0 ) = V (x0 , y1 ) ∩ V (x0 , y2 ) ∩ · · · ∩ V (x0 , ym ). Then we see that the
set V (x0 ) × Y is contained in the union of a finite number of sets of the form

V (x0 , y) × W (x0 , y), y ∈ Y.
Thus to prove X × Y is compact it suffices to show that X × Y is contained in
a finite union of sets of the form V (x) × Y . As each V (x) is an open set containing

x ∈ X , the family V (x), x ∈ X , is an open covering of the compact space (X, τ 1 ).
Therefore there exist x1 , x2 , . . . , xk such that X ⊆ V (x1 ) ∪ V (x2 ) ∪ . . . V (xk ). Thus
X × Y ⊆ (V (x1 ) × Y ) ∪ (V (x2 ) × Y ) ∪ · · · ∪ (V (xk ) × Y ), as required. Hence
(X, τ 1 ) × (Y, τ 2 ) is compact.
The proof is completed by induction. Assume that the product of any N compact
spaces is compact. Consider the product (X1 , τ 1 ) × (X2 , τ 2 ) × · · · × (XN +1 , τ N +1 )
of compact spaces (Xi , τ i ), i = 1, . . . , N + 1. Then
(X1 , τ 1 ) × (X2 , τ 2 ) × · · · × (XN + 1, τ N + 1)

(γ) p(x + y) ⩽ p(x) + p(y), for all x, y ∈ V .
Obviously if p(x) = 0 implies x = 0, then p is a norm. Verify each of the

(c) Let {pα : α ∈ I}, for some index set I , be any set of seminorms on

V . Let τ be the coarsest topology on V such that each pα : V → R

Conversely, if (V, τ ) is a locally convex space and {pα : α ∈ I}, for
some index set I , is the set of all seminorms on V such that each

(d) Let (V, τ ) a locally convex space and {pα : α ∈ I}, for some index set I ,

Definition.

Let (X,

in X . The component in X of x, CX (x), is defined to be the union of all
connected subsets of X which contain x.

8.4.2

Proposition.

Let x be any point in a topological space (X,

τ ). Then

CX (x) is connected.

Proof.

Let {Ci : i ∈ I} be the family of all connected subsets of (X,

contain x. (Observe that {x} ∈ {Ci : i ∈ I}.) Then CX (x) =

S

τ ) which

i∈I Ci .

Let O be a subset of CX (x) which is clopen in the topology induced on CX (x)
by

τ . Then O ∩ Ci is clopen in the induced topology on Ci, for each i.
But as each Ci is connected, O ∩ Ci = Ci or Ø, for each i. If O ∩ Cj = Cj for

some j ∈ I , then x ∈ O . So, in this case, O ∩ Ci 6= Ø, for all i ∈ I as each Ci
contains x. Therefore O ∩ Ci = Ci , for all i ∈ I or O ∩ Ci = Ø, for all i ∈ I ; that
is, O = CX (x) or O = Ø.
So CX (x) has no proper non-empty clopen subset and hence is connected.

there exists a connected set C containing both a and b then CX (a) = CX (b).

Proof.

By Definition 8.4.1, CX (a) ⊇ C and CX (b) ⊇ C . Therefore a ∈ CX (b).

By Proposition 8.4.2, CX (b) is connected and so is a connected set containing

a. Thus, by Definition 8.4.1, CX (a) ⊇ CX (b).
Similarly CX (b) ⊇ CX (a), and we have shown that CX (a) = CX (b).

To show that the product of a finite number of connected spaces is

τ ) and (Y, τ 1) be connected spaces and hx0, y0i any point in the
product space (X × Y, τ 2 ). Let hx1 , y1 i be any other point in X × Y . Then the
subspace {x0 } × Y of (X × Y, τ ) is homeomorphic to the connected space (Y, τ 1 )
So let (X,

and so is connected.
Similarly the subspace X × {y1 } is connected.

Furthermore, hx0 , y1 i lies in

the connected space {x0 } × Y , so CX×Y (hx0 , y1 i) ⊇ {x0 } × Y 3 hx0 , y0 i, while

hx0 , y1 i ∈ X × {y1 }, and so CX×Y ((x0 , y1 )) ⊇ X × {y1 } 3 (x1 , y1 ).
Thus hx0 , y0 i and hx1 , y1 i lie in the connected set CX×Y (hx0 , y1 i), and so
by Lemma 8.4.4, CX×Y (hx0 , y0 i) = CX×Y (hx1 , y1 i). In particular, hx1 , y1 i ∈
CX×Y (hx0 , y0 i). As hx1 , y1 i was an arbitrary point in X × Y , we have that

CX×Y (hx0 , y0 i) = X × Y. Hence (X × Y, τ 2 ) is connected.

Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

In this section we give an application of topology to another branch of mathematics.
We show how to use compactness and the Generalized Heine-Borel Theorem 8.3.3
to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. (See also Section 13.2.)

8.5.1

Theorem.

(The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra) Every
polynomial f (z) = an z n + an−1 z n−1 + · · · + a1 z + a0 , where each ai is a complex
number, an 6= 0, and n ⩾ 1, has a root; that is, there exists a complex number

z0 such that f (z0 ) = 0.
Proof.

(1)

If we put p0 =|f (0)| = |a0 | then, by inequality (1), there exists a T > 0 such that

|f (z)| > p0 ,

for all |z| > T

(2)

Consider the set D = {z : z ∈ complex plane and |z| ⩽ T }. This is a closed
bounded subset of the complex plane C = R2 and so, by the Generalized Heine-Borel
Theorem, is compact. Therefore, by Proposition 7.2.14, the continuous function

|f | : D → R has a least value at some point z0 . So
|f (z0 )| ⩽ |f (z)|, for all z ∈ D.
By (2), for all z ∈
/ D, |f (z)| > p0 = |f (0)| ⩾ |f (z0 )|. Therefore

|f (z0 )| ⩽ |f (z)|, for all z ∈ C
(3)
So we are required to prove that f (z0 ) = 0. To do this it is convenient to perform
a ‘translation’. Put P (z) = f (z + z0 ). Then, by (2),
|P (0)| ⩽ |P (z)|,

for all z ∈ C

(4)

218

CHAPTER 8. FINITE PRODUCTS

The problem of showing that f (z0 ) = 0 is now converted to the equivalent one of
proving that P (0) = 0.
Now P (z) = bn z n + bn−1 z n−1 · · · + b0 ,
b0 = 0.
Suppose b0 6= 0. Then

bi ∈ C. So P (0) = b0 . We shall show that

P (z) = b0 + bk z k + z k+1 Q(z),

(5)

where Q(z) is a polynomial and k is the smallest i > 0 with bi 6= 0.
e.g. if P (z) = 10z 7 + 6z 5 + 3z 4 + 4z 3 + 2z 2 + 1, then b0 = 1, bk = 2, (b1 = 0),
and
Q(z)

}|

P (z) = 1 + 2z + z (4 + 3z + 6z + 10z ) .

Let w ∈ C be a k th root of the number −b0 /bk ; that is, w k = −b0 /bk .
As Q(z) is a polynomial, for t a real number,

t |Q(tw)| → 0,
This implies that t |w k+1 Q(tw)| → 0

as t → 0

as t → 0.

So there exists a real number t0 with 0 < t0 < 1 such that

t0 |wk+1 Q(t0 w)| < |b0 |
So, by (5),

(6)

P (t0 w) = b0 + bk (t0 w)k + (t0 w)k+1 Q(t0 w)

 
−b
0
= b0 + bk t0 k
+ (t0 w)k+1 Q(t0 w)
bk
= b0 (1 − t0 k ) + (t0 w)k+1 Q(t0 w)

Therefore

|P (t0 w)| ⩽ (1 − t0 k )|b0 | + t0 k+1 |wk+1 Q(t0 w)|
< (1 − t0 k ) |b0 | + t0 k |b0 |,
= |b0 |
= |P (0)|

by (6)

(7)

But (7) contradicts (4). Therefore the supposition that b0 6= 0 is false; that is,

P (0) = 0, as required.

8.6. POSTSCRIPT

219

Postscript

As mentioned in the Introduction, this is one of three chapters devoted to product
spaces. The easiest case is that of finite products. In the next chapter we study
countably infinite products and in Chapter 10, the general case. The most important
result proved in this section is Tychonoff ’s Theorem 8.3.11 . In Chapter 10 this is
generalized to arbitrary sized products.
The second result we called a theorem here is the Generalized Heine-Borel
Theorem 8.3.3 which characterizes the compact subsets of Rn as those which are
closed and bounded.
Exercises 8.3 #1 introduced the notion of locally compact topological space.
Such spaces play a central role in topological group theory. (See Appendix 5.)
Our study of connectedness has been furthered in this section by defining the
component of a point.

This allows us to partition any topological space into
connected sets. In a connected space like Rn the component of any point is the whole
space. At the other end of the scale, the components in any totally disconnected
space, for example, Q, are all singleton sets.
As mentioned above, compactness has a local version. So too does connectedness.
Exercises 8.4 #5 defined locally connected. However, while every compact space
is locally compact, not every connected space is locally connected. Indeed many
properties P have local versions called locally P , and P usually does not imply
locally P and locally P usually does not imply P .
Towards the end of the chapter we gave a topological proof of the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra 8.5.1. The fact that a theorem in one branch of mathematics
can be proved using methods from another branch is but one indication of why
mathematics should not be compartmentalized.

While you may have separate

courses on algebra, complex analysis, and number theory these topics are, in fact,
interrelated.
In Appendix 5 we introduce the notion of a topological group, that is a set with
the structure of both a topological space and a group, and with the two structures
related in an appropriate manner. Topological group theory is a rich and interesting

You should have noticed how sparingly we use the word “theorem”, so when we do use that term
it is because the result is important.

branch of mathematics. Appendix 5 can be studied using the prerequisite knowledge
in this chapter.
For those who know some category theory, we observe that the category of
topological spaces and continuous mappings has both products and coproducts.
The products in the category are indeed the products of the topological spaces.
You may care to identify the coproducts.

Chapter 9

Countable Products
Introduction
Intuition tells us that a curve has zero area. Thus you should be astonished to learn
of the existence of space-filling curves. We attack this topic using the curious space
known as the Cantor Space. It is surprising that an examination of this space leads
us to a better understanding of the properties of the unit interval [0, 1].
Previously we have studied finite products of topological spaces. In this chapter
we extend our study to countably infinite products of topological spaces. This leads
us into wonderfully rich territory of which space-filling curves is but one example.

The Cantor Set

9.1.1

Remark.

We now construct a very curious (but useful) set known as

the Cantor Set. Consider the closed unit interval [0,1] and delete from it the open
interval ( 13 , 32 ), which is the middle third, and denote the remaining closed set by
G1 . So

G1 = [0, 13 ] ∪ [ 23 , 1].
Next, delete from G1 the open intervals ( 19 , 29 ) and ( 97 , 89 ) which are the middle
third of its two pieces and denote the remaining closed set by G2 . So

G2 = [0, 19 ] ∪ [ 29 , 13 ] ∪ [ 23 , 79 ] ∪ [ 89 , 1].

If we continue in this way, at each stage deleting the open middle third of each
closed interval remaining from the previous stage we obtain a descending sequence
of closed sets

The Cantor Set, G, is defined by

G=

n=1
and, being the intersection of closed sets, is a closed subset of [0,1]. As [0,1] is
compact, the Cantor Space, (G,

τ ), (that is, G with the subspace topology) is

compact. [The Cantor Set is named after the famous set theorist, Georg Cantor
(1845–1918).]

9.1. THE CANTOR SET

223

It is useful to represent the Cantor Set in terms of real numbers written to base
3; that is, ternaries. You are familiar with the decimal expansion of real numbers
which uses base 10. Today one cannot avoid computers which use base 2. But for
the Cantor Set, base 3 is what is best.
5 would be written as 2211·0012, since this represents
In the ternary system, 76 81
2.33 + 2.32 + 1.31 + 1.30 + 0.3−1 + 0.3−2 + 1.3−3 + 2.3−4 .
So a number x in [0, 1] is represented by the base 3 number ·a1 a2 a3 . . . an . . . , where

3
(Of course another ternary expression for 31 is 0·10000 . . . and another for 1 is
1·0000 . . . .)
Turning again to the Cantor Set, G, it should be clear that an element of [0, 1]
is in G if and only if it can be written in ternary form with an 6= 1, for every n ∈ N.
5 ∈
So 12 ∈

Thus we have a function f from the Cantor Set into the set of all sequences
of the form ha1 , a2 , a3 , . . . , an , . . . i, where each ai ∈ {0, 2} and f is one-to-one and
onto. Later on we shall make use of this function f .

point if x ∈ X \ X 0 ; that is, x is not a limit point of X . The space (X, ) is

said to be perfect if it has no isolated points. Prove that the Cantor Space is
a compact totally disconnected perfect space.
[It can be shown that any non-empty compact totally disconnected metrizable
perfect space is homeomorphic to the Cantor Space. See, for example, Exercise
6.2A(c) of Engelking [130].

xi ∈ Xi for all i. (The infinite sequence hx1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . . i is sometimes

τ is called the product topology.

So a basic open set is of the form

O1 × O2 × · · · × On × Xn+1 × Xn+2 × . . . .

It should be obvious that a product of open sets need not be open

in the product topology

each Oi ∈

9.2.2

Remark.

Why do we choose to define the product topology as in

Definition 9.2.1?

The answer is that only with this definition do we obtain

Tychonoff ’s Theorem (for infinite products), which says that any product of compact
spaces is compact. And this result is extremely important for applications.

Another justification for our choice of definition of the product topology is the

From Proposition 9.3.11 we see that a countably infinite

product of discrete spaces is completely metrizable. The most interesting example
of this is Nℵ0 , that is a countably infinite product of topological spaces each
homeomorphic to the discrete space N. What is much more surprising is the fact,
as mentioned in Chapter 6, that N∞ is homeomorphic to P, the topological
space of all irrational numbers with the euclidean topology. See Engelking

Remark.

Another important example of a completely metrizable

countable product is R . This is the countably infinite product of topological
spaces each homeomorphic to R. Corollary 4.3.25 of Engelking [130] shows that:
a separable metrizable space is completely metrizable if and only if it is
homeomorphic to a closed subspace of R∞ . In particular we see that every
separable Banach space is homeomorphic to a closed subspace of R∞ .

Banach space is homeomorphic to R∞ , see Bessaga and Pelczynski [41].

CHAPTER 9. COUNTABLE PRODUCTS

9.4.11

Theorem.

(Urysohn’s Theorem)

Every separable metric space

(X, d) is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Hilbert cube.

Proof.

By Corollary 9.4.10 this result will follow if we can find a countably infinite

family of mappings fi : (X, d) −→ [0, 1], which are (i) continuous, and (ii) separate
points and closed sets.
Without loss of generality we can assume that d(a, b) ⩽ 1, for all a and b in X ,
since every metric is equivalent to such a metric.
As (X, d) is separable, there exists a countable dense subset Y = {yi , i ∈ N}.
For each i ∈ N, define fi : X −→ [0, 1] by fi (x) = d(x, yi ). It is clear that each
mapping fi is continuous.
To see that the mappings {fi : i ∈ N} separate points and closed sets, let x ∈ X
and A be any closed set not containing x. Now X \ A is an open set about x and
so contains an open ball B of radius ε and centre x, for some ε > 0.
Further, as Y is dense in X , there exists a yn such that d(x, yn ) < 2ε . Thus
d(yn , a) ⩾ 2ε , for all a ∈ A.
So [0, 2ε ) is an open set in [0, 1] which contains fn (x), but fn (a) 6∈ [0, 2ε ), for
all a ∈ A. This implies fn (A) ⊆ [ 2ε , 1]. As the set [ 2ε , 1] is closed, this implies
fn (A) ⊆ [ 2ε , 1].
Hence fn (x) ∈
/ fn (A) and thus the family {fi : i ∈ N} separates points and
closed sets.

Our next task is to verify the converse of Urysohn’s Theorem. To do this we
introduce a new concept. (See Exercises 2.2 #4.)

A topological space (X,

Proof.

Let (X,

i ∈ N}. Let B consist of all the open balls (in the metric d) with centre yi , for some
i, and radius n1 , for some positive integer n. Clearly B is countable and we shall
show that it is a basis for

v , for some n. As Y is dense in X , there exists a ym ∈ Y , such that d(ym , v) < 2n
1 . Then the triangle inequality
Let B 0 be the open ball with centre ym and radius 2n
implies B 0 ⊆ B ⊆ V . Also B 0 ∈ B . Hence B is a basis for τ . So (X, τ ) is second
countable.

242

CHAPTER 9. COUNTABLE PRODUCTS

Conversely let (X,

τ ) be second countable, having a countable basis B1 = {Bi :

i ∈ N}. For each Bi 6= Ø, let bi be any element of Bi , and put Z equal to the set
of all such bi . Then Z is a countable set. Further, if V ∈ τ , then V ⊇ Bi , for some
i, and so bi ∈ V. Thus V ∩ Z 6= Ø. Hence Z is dense in X . Consequently (X, τ ) is
separable.


9.4.18

Remark.

The above proof shows that every second countable space

is separable, even without the assumption of metrizability. However, it is not true,
in general, that a separable space is second countable. (See Exercises 9.4 #11.)

Conversely, let (X, ) be homeomorphic to the subspace (Y, 1 ) of the Hilbert

It is also easily verified (Exercises 6.1 #6) that any subspace of a

metrizable space is metrizable.

As the Hilbert cube is metrizable, by Corollary

τ 1) is metrizable. So (Y, τ 1) is metrizable and satisfies
the second axiom of countability. Therefore it is separable. Hence (X, τ ) is also

In the proof of Theorem 9.3.8 we showed that the Hilbert cube

this direction.

τ 1) is a
continuous image of a subspace of the Cantor Space (G, τ ). Further, if (X, τ 1 )
is compact, then the subspace can be chosen to be closed in (G, τ ).

9.5.2

Proposition.

Every separable metrizable space (X,

τ ) onto I ∞ shown to exist in the
proof of Theorem 9.3.8. By Urysohn’s Theorem 9.4.19, (X, τ 1 ) is homeomorphic
to a subspace (Y, τ 2 ) of I ∞ . Let the homeomorphism of (Y, τ 2 ) onto (X, τ 1 ) be
Θ. Let Z = ψ −1 (Y ) and τ 3 be the subspace topology on Z . Then Θ ◦ ψ is a
continuous mapping of (Z, τ 3 ) onto (X, τ 1 ). So (X, τ 1 ) is a continuous image of
the subspace (Z, τ 3 ) of (G, τ ).
Further if (X, τ 1 ) is compact, then (Y, τ 2 ) is compact and hence closed in I ∞ .
So Z = ψ −1 (Y ) is a closed subset of (G, τ ), as required.
Proof.

Let φ be the continuous mapping of (G,

τ 1) be a (non-empty) closed subspace of the
Cantor Space (G, τ ). Then there exists a continuous mapping of (G, τ ) onto
(Y, τ 1 ).
9.5.3

Proposition.

Let (Y,

Let (G0 , τ 0 ) be the set of all real numbers which can be written in the
P∞ ai
form
i=1 6i , where each ai = 0 or 5, with the subspace topology induced from R.
The space (G0 , τ 0 ) is called the middle two-thirds Cantor Space. Clearly (G0 , τ 0 )
is homeomorphic to the Cantor Space (G, τ ).
We can regard (Y, τ 1 ) as a closed subspace of (G0 , τ 0 ) and seek a continuous
mapping of (G0 , τ 0 ) onto (Y, τ 1 ). Before proceeding, observe from the construction
g +g
of the middle two thirds Cantor space that if g1 ∈ G0 and g2 ∈ G0 , then 1 2 2 ∈
/ G0 .
The map ψ : (G0 , τ 0 ) −→ (Y, τ 1 ) which we seek is defined as follows: for g ∈ G0 ,
ψ(g) is the unique element of Y which is closest to g in the euclidean metric on R.
Proof.

However we have to prove that such a unique closest element exists.
Fix g ∈ G0 . Then the map dg : (Y, 1 ) −→ R given by dg (y) = |g − y| is
continuous. As (Y, 1 ) is compact, Proposition 7.2.15 implies that dg (Y ) has a

τ

τ

least element. So there exists an element of (Y,

τ 1) which is closest to g. Suppose

there are two such elements y1 and y2 in Y which are equally close to g . Then

g = y1 +y
∈

2 . But y1 ∈ G and y2 ∈ G and so, as observed above, g =
2

9.5. PEANO’S THEOREM

249

which is a contradiction. So there exists a unique element of Y which is closest to

g . Call this element ψ(g).
It is clear that the map ψ : (G0 ,

τ 0) −→ (Y, τ 1) is surjective, since for each

y ∈ Y , ψ(y) = y . To prove continuity of ψ , let g ∈ G0 . Let ε be any given positive
real number. Then it suffices, by Corollary 6.2.4, to find a δ > 0, such that if x ∈ G0
and |g − x| < δ then |ψ(g) − ψ(x)| < ε.
Consider firstly the case when g ∈ Y , so ψ(g) = g . Put δ = 2ε . Then for x ∈ G0
with |g − x| < δ we have
|ψ(g) − ψ(x)| = |g − ψ(x)|
⩽ |x − ψ(x)| + |g − x|
⩽ |x − g| + |g − x|, by definition of ψ since g ∈ Y

= 2|x − g|
< 2δ
= ε, as required.
Now consider the case when g ∈
/ Y , so g 6= ψ(g).
Without loss of generality, assume ψ(g) < g and put a = g − ψ(g).
a
If the set Y ∩ [g, 1] = Ø, then ψ(x) = ψ(g) for all x ∈ (g − a
2 , g + 2 ).
Thus for δ < a
2 , we have |ψ(x) − ψ(g)| = 0 < ε, as required.
If Y ∩ [g, 1] 6= Ø, then as Y ∩ [g, 1] is compact it has a least element y > g .
Indeed by the definition of ψ , if b = y − g , then b > a.
Now put δ = b−a
2 .
So if x ∈ G0 with |g − x| < δ , then either ψ(x) = ψ(g) or ψ(x) = y . Observe that

|x − ψ(g)| ⩽ |x − g| + |g − ψ(g)| < δ + a =
while

|x − y| ⩾ |g − y| − |g − x| ⩾ b −

2 2

So ψ(x) = ψ(g).
Thus |ψ(x) − ψ(g)| = 0 < ε, as required. Hence ψ is continuous.



Thus we obtain from Propositions 9.5.2 and 9.5.3 the following theorem of
Alexandroff and Urysohn:

250

CHAPTER 9. COUNTABLE PRODUCTS

9.5.4

Theorem.

Every compact metrizable space is a continuous image

of the Cantor Space.

9.5.5

Remark.

The converse of Theorem 9.5.4 is false. It is not true that

every continuous image of a Cantor Space is a compact metrizable space. (Find
an example.) However, an analogous statement is true if we look only at Hausdorff
spaces. Indeed we have the following proposition.

9.5.6

Proposition.

Let f be a continuous mapping of a compact metric

space (X, d) onto a Hausdorff space (Y,

τ 1). Then (Y, τ 1) is compact and

metrizable.
Proof.

Since every continuous image of a compact space is compact, the space

(Y, τ 1 ) is certainly compact. As the map f is surjective, we can define a metric d1
on Y as follows: for each y1 , y2 ∈ Y , d1 (y1 , y2 ) equals
inf {d(a1 , b1 ) + · · · + d(an , bn ) : f (a1 ) = y1 , f (bn ) = y2 , bi = ai+1 , i = 1, . . . , n − 1}.

n∈N

We need to show that d1 is indeed a metric; this is left as an exercise. (See
Exercises 9.5 #3.)

τ 2 be the topology induced on Y by d1. We have to show that τ 1 = τ 2.
Firstly, by the definition of d1 , f : (X, τ ) −→ (Y, τ 2 ) is certainly continuous and
so (X, τ 2 ) is compact.
Let

Observe that for a subset C of Y ,

C is a closed subset of (Y, τ 1 )
⇒ f −1 (C) is a closed subset of (X, τ )
⇒ f −1 (C) is a compact subset of (X, τ )
⇒ f (f −1 (C)) is a compact subset of (Y, τ 2 )
⇒ C is a compact subset of (Y, τ 2 )
⇒ C is closed in (Y, τ 2 ).
So

τ 1 ⊆ τ 2. Similarly we can prove τ 2 ⊆ τ 1, and thus τ 1 = τ 2.

9.5. PEANO’S THEOREM

9.5.7

Corollary.

251

Let (X,

τ ) be a Hausdorff space. Then it is a continuous

image of the Cantor Space if and only if it is compact and metrizable.

Finally in this chapter we turn to space-filling curves.
9.5.8

Remark.

Everyone thinks he or she knows what a “curve” is. Formally
we can define a curve in R2 to be the set f [0, 1], where f is a continuous map

f : [0, 1] −→ R2 . It seems intuitively clear that a curve has no breadth and hence
zero area. This is false! In fact there exist space-filling curves; that is, f (I) has nonzero area. Indeed the next theorem shows that there exists a continuous mapping
of [0, 1] onto the product space [0, 1] × [0, 1].

9.5.9

Theorem.

For each positive integer n, there exists a
of [0, 1] onto the n-cube I n .

(Peano)

continuous mapping ψn

By Theorem 9.5.4, there exists a continuous mapping φn of the Cantor
Space (G, ) onto the n-cube I n . As (G, ) is obtained from [0, 1] by successively
Proof.

τ

τ

dropping out middle thirds, we extend φn to a continuous mapping ψn : [0, 1] −→ I n
by defining ψn to be linear on each omitted interval; that is, if (a, b) is one of the
open intervals comprising [0, 1] \ G, then ψn is defined on (a, b) by

ψn (αa + (1 − α) b) = α φn (a) + (1 − α) φn (b),

0 ⩽ α ⩽ 1.

It is easily verified that ψn is continuous.
We conclude this chapter by stating (but not proving) the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz
Theorem which characterizes those Hausdorff spaces which are continuous images
of [0,1]. [For a proof of the theorem see Wilder [424] and p. 221 of Kuratowski
[249].] But first we need a definition.

CHAPTER 9. COUNTABLE PRODUCTS

9.5.10

Definition.

A topological space (X,

τ ) is said to be locally

connected if it has a basis of connected (open) sets.

9.5.11

Remark.

Every discrete space is locally connected as are Rn and Sn , for

all n ⩾ 1. However, not every connected space is locally connected. (See Exercises
8.4 #6.)
Our final theorem in this section is beautiful. It was proved by Hans Hahn (1879–
1934) and Stefan Mazurkiewicz (1888–1945). Its proof can be found in Hocking
and Young [189].

Postscript

In this chapter we have extended the notion of a product of a finite number of
topological spaces to that of the product of a countable number of topological
spaces. While this step is a natural one, it has led us to a rich collection of results,
some of which are very surprising.
We proved that a countable product of topological spaces with property P has
property P , where P is any of the following:
(v) connected

(i) T0 -space

(ii) T1 -space

(vi) totally disconnected

(iii)

Hausdorff

(vii) second

It is also true when P is compact, this result being the Tychonoff

9.6. POSTSCRIPT

255

Theorem for countable products. The proof of the countable Tychonoff Theorem
for metrizable spaces presented here is quite different from the standard one which
appears in the next section. Our proof relies on the Cantor Space.
The Cantor Space was defined to be a certain subspace of [0, 1]. Later it was
shown that it is homeomorphic to a countably infinite product of 2-point discrete
spaces. The Cantor Space appears to be the kind of pathological example pure
mathematicians are fond of producing in order to show that some general statement
is false. But it turns out to be much more than this.
The Alexandroff-Urysohn Theorem 9.5.4 says that every compact metrizable
space is an image of the Cantor Space. In particular [0, 1] and the Hilbert cube (a
countable infinite product of copies of [0, 1]) is a continuous image of the Cantor
Space. This leads us to the existence of space-filling curves – in particular, we show
that there exists a continuous map of [0, 1] onto the cube [0, 1]n , for each positive
integer n. We stated, but did not prove, the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz Theorem 9.5.12:
The Hausdorff space (X,

τ ) is an image of [0, 1] if and only if it is compact connected

locally connected and metrizable.
Next we mention Urysohn’s Theorem 9.4.19, which says that a space is separable
and metrizable if and only if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Hilbert cube.
This shows that [0, 1] is not just a “nice” topological space, but a “generator” of
the important class of separable metrizable spaces via the formation of subspaces
and countable products.
Finally we mention a beautiful and deep theorem related to countably infinite
products which we have not proved in this chapter. For proofs of this theorem and
discussion, see Anderson and Bing [12],Toruǹczyk [396], and Bessaga and Pelczynski
[41]. We include a few related and surprising results from Bessaga and Pelczynski
[41]; for example, the open unit ball, the closed unit ball, the unit sphere, any
non-empty open convex subset, and any closed convex set with non-empty
interior in a separable infinite-dimensional Banach space B are homeomorphic
to each other and to the whole space B .
Note that, within the context of topological vector spaces a Frechet space is
a complete metrizable locally convex topological vector space.

x
O = {x : ||x|| < 1} an open ball in N of radius 1. Observe that x 7→ 1+||x||
is
x
a continuous map of N onto O with continuous inverse x 7→

Remark.

Teachers of topology and authors of books on topology should

give some thought to Corollary 9.6.8. Often when teaching topology some teachers
give many examples of topological spaces drawn from the set of infinite-dimensional
separable Banach spaces. But we now see that these spaces are all homeomorphic,
so as far as topology is concerned they represent the same example over and over
again.

Tychonoff ’s Theorem
Introduction
In Chapter 9 we defined the product of a countably infinite family of topological
spaces. We now proceed to define the product of any family of topological spaces
by replacing the set {1, 2, . . . , n, . . . } by an arbitrary index set I . The central result
will be the general Tychonoff Theorem.
The reader should be aware that this chapter is more sophisticated and
challenging than previous chapters. However, the reward is that you will experience,
and hopefully enjoy, some beautiful mathematics.

The Product Topology For All Products

10.1.1

Definitions.

Let I be a set, and for each i ∈ I , let (Xi ,

τ i)

be a topological space. We write the indexed family of topological spaces as

{(Xi , τ i ) : i ∈ I}. Then the product (or cartesian product) of the family of
Q
sets {Xi : i ∈ I} is denoted by
i∈I Xi , and consists of the set of all functions
S
f : I −→ i∈I Xi such that fi = xi ∈ Xi . We denote the element f of the
Q
th
product by
i∈I xi , and refer to f (i) = xi as the i coordinate.
If I = {1, 2} then

Q

i∈{1,2} Xi is just the set of all functions f : {1, 2} →
X1 ∪ X2 such that f (1) ∈ X1 and f (2) ∈ X2 . A moment’s thought

set “isomorphic to” X1 × X2 . Similarly if
i∈{1,2} Xi is a Q
I = {1, 2, . . . , n, . . . }, then i∈I Xi is “isomorphic to” our previously

defined
i=1 Xi .

Remark.

Although we have defined

yourself that when I is countably infinite or finite the new definition is equivalent to
our previous ones. Once this is realized many results on countable products can be
proved for uncountable products in an analogous fashion. We state them below. It
is left as an exercise for the reader to prove these results for uncountable products.

Zorn’s Lemma

Our next task is to prove the general Tychonoff Theorem which says that any
product of compact spaces is compact. However, to do this we need to use Zorn’s
Lemma which requires a little preparation.
10.2.1

Definitions.

(Davey and Priestley [97]) A partial order on a set

X is a binary relation, denoted by ⩽, which has the properties:
(i) x ⩽ x, for all x ∈ X

(reflexive)

(ii) if x ⩽ y and y ⩽ x, then x = y , for x, y ∈ X
(iii) if x ⩽ y and y ⩽ z , then x ⩽ z , for x, y, z ∈ X

(antisymmetric), and
(transitive)

The set X equipped with the partial order ⩽ is called a partially ordered set or
a poset and is denoted by (X, ⩽). If x ⩽ y and x 6= y , then we write x < y .

10.2.2

Examples.

The prototype of a partially ordered set is the set N of all

natural numbers equipped with the usual ordering of natural numbers.
Similarly the sets Z, Q, and R with their usual orderings form partially ordered
sets.



266

10.2.3

CHAPTER 10. TYCHONOFF’S THEOREM

Example.

Let N be the set of natural numbers and let ⩽ be defined as

follows:

n⩽m

if

n divides m

So 3 ⩽ 6 but 3 6⩽ 5. (It is left as an exercise to verify that with this ordering N is a



partially ordered set.)

10.2.4

Example.

Let X be the class of all subsets of a set U . We can define

a partial ordering on X by putting

A⩽B

if

A is a subset of B

where A and B are in X .
It is easily verified that this is a partial order.



Example.
Let (X, ⩽) be a partially ordered set. We can define a new
∗
partial order ⩽ on X by defining
10.2.5

x ⩽∗ y

if

y ⩽ x.

CHAPTER 10. TYCHONOFF’S THEOREM

10.2.7

Definition.

Two elements x and y of a partially ordered set (X, ⩽)

are said to be comparable if either x ⩽ y or y ⩽ x.

10.2.8

We saw in the order diagram above that the elements d and

Remark.

c are not comparable. Also 1 and e are not comparable.
In N, Q, R, and Z with the usual orderings, every two elements are comparable.
In Example 10.2.4, 3 and 5 are not comparable.


10.2.9

Definitions.

A partially ordered set (X, ⩽) is said to be linearly

ordered (or totally ordered) if every two elements are comparable. The order

⩽ is then said to be a linear order (or a total order.) The linear ordering is
said to be a strict linear ordering (or a strict total ordering) if

a ⩽ b and b ⩽ a =⇒ a = b, for a, b ∈ X.

10.2.10

Examples.

The usual orders on R, Q, N, and Z are linear orders.

The partial order of Example 10.2.4 is not a linear order (if U has at least two



points).

10.2.11

Definition.

Let (X, ⩽) be a partially ordered set. Then an element

s ∈ X is said to be the greatest element of X if x ⩽ s, for all x ∈ X .

10.2.12

Definition.

Let (X, ⩽) be a partially ordered set and Y a subset

of X . An element t ∈ X is said to be an upper bound for Y if y ⩽ t, for all

y ∈Y.
It is important to note that an upper bound for Y need not be in Y .

It is important to distinguish between maximal elements and
Consider the order diagram in Example 10.2.6.

There is no

greatest element! However, j, h, i and f are all maximal elements.

10.2.15

Remark.

We can now state Zorn’s Lemma.



Despite the name

“Lemma”, it is, in fact, an axiom and cannot be proved. It is equivalent to various
other axioms of Set Theory such as the Axiom of Choice and the Well-Ordering
Theorem. [A partially ordered set (S, ⩽) is said to be well-ordered if every nonempty subset of S has a least element.

The Well-Ordering Theorem states

that there exists a well-ordering on every set. See, for example, Halmos [168]
or Wilder [424].]

For a discussion of Zorn’s Lemma, the Axiom of Choice and

Tychonoff ’s Theorem, see Remark A6.1.24. Also see Rubin and Rubin [348]. We
shall take Zorn’s Lemma as one of the axioms of our set theory and so use it
whenever we wish.
10.2.16

Axiom.

(Zorn’s Lemma)

Let (X, ⩽) be a non-empty partially

ordered set in which every subset which is linearly ordered has an upper bound.
Then (X, ⩽) has a maximal element.

10.2.17

Example.

Let us apply Zorn’s Lemma to the lattice diagram of

Example 10.2.6. There are many linearly ordered subsets:

{i, g, b, a}, {g, b, a}, {b, a}, {g, b}, {i, g}, {a}, {b},
{g}, {i}, {i, b, a}, {i, g, a}, {i.a}, {g, a}, {h, g, e},
{h, e}, {g, e}, etc.
Each of these has an upper bound – i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, h, h, h, etc.

Zorn’s

Lemma then says that there is a maximal element. In fact there are 4 maximal
elements, j, h, f and i.

Assume that every family F of closed subsets of X with the finite

T

F ∈F F 6= Ø. Let U be any open covering of X . Put
F equal to the family of complements of members of U . So each F ∈ F is closed
intersection property satisfies

τ ). As U is an open covering of X ,

T

F ∈F F = Ø. By our assumption, then,
F does not have the finite intersection property. So for some F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn in F ,

F1 ∩F2 ∩· · ·∩Fn = Ø. Thus U1 ∪U2 ∪· · ·∪Un = X , where Ui = X \Fi , i = 1, . . . , n.
So U has a finite subcovering. Hence (X, τ ) is compact.
The converse statement is proved similarly.

Let Z be the collection of all families of subsets of X which contain F

and have the finite intersection property. Define a partial order ⩽ on Z as follows:
if F1 and F2 are in Z then put F1 ⩽ F2 if F1 ⊆ F2 . Let Y be any linearly ordered

Proof.
We shall use Proposition 10.3.2 to show that (X, ) =
i∈I (Xi , i ) is
compact, if each (Xi , i ) is compact. Let F be any family T
of closed subsets of X
with the finite intersection property. We have to prove that F ∈F F 6= Ø.
By Lemma 10.3.3 there is a maximal family H of (not necessarily closed) subsets
of (X, ) that contains F and has the finite intersection property. We shall prove
T
T
that H∈H H 6= Ø, from which follows the required result F ∈F F 6= Ø, since each
F ∈ F is closed.
As H is maximal with the property that it contains F and has the finite
intersection property, if H1 , H2 , . . . , Hn ∈ H, for any n ∈ N, then the set H 0 =
H1 ∩H2 ∩· · ·∩Hn ∈ H. Suppose this was not the case. Then the set H0 = H∪{H 0 }
would properly contain H and also have the property that it contains F and has the
finite intersection property. This is a contradiction to H being maximal. So H0 = H
and H 0 = H1 ∩ H2 ∩ · · · ∩ Hn ∈ H.
Let S be any subset of X that intersects non-trivially every member of H. We
0
claim that H∪{S} has the finite intersection property. To see this let H10 , H20 , . . . , Hm
0 6= Ø. By the previous
be members of H. We shall show that S ∩ H10 ∩ H20 ∩ . . . Hm
0 ∈ H. So by assumption S ∩ (H 0 ∩ H 0 ∩ . . . H 0 ) 6= Ø.

Hence H ∪ {S} has the finite intersection property and contains F . Again using
the fact that H is maximal with the property that it contains F and has the finite
intersection property, we see that S ∈ H.

Fix i ∈ I and let pi : i∈I (Xi , i ) → (Xi , i ) be the projection mapping. Then
the family {pi (H) : H ∈ H} has the finite intersection property. Therefore the

That the family {fa : a ∈ X} separates points and closed sets is easily shown (cf. the

(X, d) is homeomorphic to a subspace of the cube I X .

Thus we now have a characterization of the subspaces of cubes.

Putting

together Proposition 10.3.17 and Corollaries 10.3.14 and 10.3.16 we obtain:

Proposition.

A topological space (X,

We now proceed to show that the class of Tychonoff spaces

is quite large and, in particular, includes all compact Hausdorff spaces.

10.3.20

Definitions.

A topological space (X,

space if for each pair of disjoint closed sets A and B , there exist open sets U
and V such that A ⊆ U , B ⊆ V and U ∩ V = Ø. A normal space which is also
Hausdorff is said to be a T4 -space.

10.3.21

Remarks.

In Exercises 6.1 #9 it is noted that every metrizable space

is a normal space. A little later we shall verify that every compact Hausdorff space
is normal. First we shall prove that every normal Hausdorff space is a Tychonoff
space (that is, every T4 -space is a T 1 -space).
32
Putting C = X \ B , and K = X \ V in Definition 10.3.20 of a normal space, we
see that a topological space (X,

closed set A and open set C with A ⊆ C , there exists a closed set K with

A ⊆ Int(K) ⊆ K ⊆ C.

that f (a) = 0 for all a ∈ A, and f (b) = 1 for all b ∈ B .

Assume that for each A and B an f with the property stated above exists.
Then U = f −1 ([0, 21 )) and V = f −1 (( 12 , 1]) are open in (X, ) and satisfy A ⊆ U ,
B ⊆ V , and A ∩ B = Ø. Hence (X, ) is normal.
Proof.

Conversely, assume (X,

a family {Ui : i ∈ D} of


open subsets of X , where the set D is given by D =

k
n
2n : k = 1, 2, . . . , 2 , n ∈ N .

So D is a set of dyadic rational numbers, such that A ⊆ Ui , Ui ∩ B = Ø, and

d1 ⩽ d2 implies Ud1 ⊆ Ud2 . As (X, τ ) is normal, for any pair A, B of disjoint closed
sets, there exist disjoint open sets U 1 and V 1 such that A ⊆ U 1 and B ⊆ V 1 . So we

C = X \ B ).

Now consider the disjoint closed sets A and U 1C . Again, by normality, there exist

disjoint open sets U 1 and V 1 such that A ⊆ U 1 and U 1C ⊆ V 1 . Also as V 1C and B

Let f (x) = y , where y 6= 0, 1 and set W = (y − ε, y + ε), for some ε > 0 (with

0 < y − ε < y + ε < 1). As D is dense in [0, 1], we can choose d0 and d1 such that
y − ε < d0 < y < d1 < y0 + ε. Then, by the definition of f , x ∈ U = Ud1 \ U d0 and
the open set U satisfies f (u) ⊆ W . If y = 1 then we put W = (y − ε, 1], choose d0
such that y − ε < d0 < 1, and set U = X \ U d0 . Again f (U ) ⊆ W . Finally, if y = 0
then put W = [0, y + ε), choose d1 such that 0 < d1 < Y + ε and set U = Ud1 to
again obtain f (U ) ⊆ W . Hence f is continuous.

V = Vb1 ∪ Vb2 ∪ · · · ∪ Vbm and U = Ub1 ∩ Ub2 ∩ · · · ∩ Ubm . Then A ⊆ U , B ⊆ V , and

such that fV U (V ) = 0 and fV U (X \ U ) = 1. Put F equal to the family of functions,

There are some surprises in

CHAPTER 10. TYCHONOFF’S THEOREM

10.3.43

Proposition.

Let (X,

τ ) be a Hausdorff topological space. The

following conditions are equivalent:
(i) (X,

τ ) is normal;

(ii) for every closed subspace (S,

τ 1) of (X, τ ) and each continuous map φ of

(S, τ 1 ) into the closed unit interval [0, 1] with the euclidean topology, there
exists a continuous extension Φ : (X, τ ) → [0, 1] of φ.

Proof.

3 Assume that (ii) is true. Let A and B be disjoint closed subsets of

(X, τ ). Put S = A ∪ B and define φ : S → R by φ(x) = 0, for x ∈ A, and φ(x) = 1,
for x ∈ B . Then clearly φ : (A ∪ B, τ 1 ) → R is continuous, where τ 1 is the
subspace topology of A ∪ B from (X, τ ). By hypothesis, there exists a continuous
map Φ : (X, τ ) → R which extends φ. Let U and V be disjoint open sets in R
containing 0 and 1, respectively. Then Φ−1 (U ) and Φ−1 (V ) are disjoint open sets
containing A and B , respectively. So (X, τ ) is indeed a normal topological space;
that is, (i) is true.
Now assume that (i) is true. Firstly let us consider the case that φ : (S,

τ 1) →

[0, 1]. Define Sr = {x ∈ S : φ(x) ⩽ r}, for r ∈ Q, and Ts = X \ {x ∈ S : φ(x) ⩾
s}, for s ∈ Q ∩ (0, 1). We define the index set P by P = {(r, s) : r, s ∈ Q with 0 ⩽
r < s < 1}. For convenience write P = {(rn , sn ) : n ∈ N}. For brevity we shall
denote the interior, Int(Y ), in (X, τ ) of any subset Y of X by Y 0 .
Our proof will use definition by mathematical induction. Noting that Sr1 is a
closed set, Ts1 is an open set, Sr1 ⊆ Ts1 and (X,
shows that there exists a closed set H1 in (X,

τ ) is normal, Remark 10.3.21

τ ) such that Sr1 ⊆ H10 ⊆ H1 ⊆ Ts1 .

Next, assume that closed sets Hk have been constructed for all k < n ∈ N such that

and

Srk ⊆ Hk0 ⊆ Hk ⊆ Tsk , for k < n,
Hj ⊆ Hk0 , when j, k < n, rj < rk and sj < sk .

Define J = {j : j < n, rj < rn , and sj < sn }
rk , and sn < sk }.

and

(1)
(2)

K = {k : k < n, rn <

The proof here is based on that of Mandelkern [275]. In the literature there are alternative proofs
using uniform continuity.

10.3. TYCHONOFF’S THEOREM

291

Noting the definitions of Sr and Ts and using (1) and (2), we can apply Remark
S
T
10.3.21, with A = Srn ∪
Hj and C = Tsn ∩
Hk0 , to show that there exists a
j∈J
k∈K
closed set Hn in (X, ) such that

Srn ∪

[

Hj ⊆ Hn0 ⊆ Hn ⊆ Tsn ∩

k∈K

From this equation (3) one can verify that

and

Srk ⊆ Hk0 ⊆ Hk ⊆ Tsk , for k < n + 1,
Hj ⊆ Hk0 , when j, k < n + 1, rj < rk and sj < sk .

(10 )
(20 )

Equations (1), (2), (1’) and (2’) complete our inductive definition of the closed sets

Hn .
Now we write Hrs for Hn where r = rn and s = sn . So that we have closed
sets Hrs , for (r, s) ∈ P , with
0 ⊆ H ⊆ T , for (r, s) ∈ P,
Sr ⊆ Hrs
rs

0
and Hrs ⊆ Htu , when r < t and s < u.

Now define Xr as follows: 


s>r

(4)
(5)

r⩾1
r<0
r ∈ Q ∩ [0, 1)

For (r, s) ∈ P , choose t such that r < t < s. Then by (6) and (5),
0 ⊆H ⊆
Xr ⊆ Hrt ⊆ Hts
Hsu = Xs
ts
u>s
From (7) we deduce that
0
Xr ⊆ Xs , for (r, s) ∈ P with r < s.
From the definitions of Sr & Tr , and equations (4) and (6) we have:

\

Sr ⊆ S ∩ Xr = S ∩

\

Hrs ⊆ S ∩

\

Ts = Sr , for r ∈ Q ∩ [0, 1).

(7)
(8)
(9)

s>r
s>r
So by (8) and noting that all the set containments in (9) are actually equality,

τ

we have found closed subsets {Xr : r ∈ Q} of (X, ) with the properties:
for r, s ∈ Q, r < s , Xr ⊆ Xs0 , and Xr ∩ S = Sr .
(10)
Finally define Φ(x) = inf{r : x ∈ Xr }, x ∈ X . By (6), Φ : (X, ) → [0, 1],

τ

and since φ(x) = inf{r : x ∈ Sr }, we have Φ(x) = φ(x), for all x ∈ S ; that is, Φ
is an extension of φ. If a, b ∈ R with a < b, then it follows immediately from the
S
definition of Φ that
Φ−1 ((a, b)) = {Xs0 \ Xr : r, s ∈ Q and a < r < s < b}, and
so Φ is continuous; that is, Φ is a continuous extension of φ, as required.

CHAPTER 10. TYCHONOFF’S THEOREM

10.3.44

Proposition.

Let (X,

τ ) be a Hausdorff topological space. The

following conditions are equivalent:
(i) (X,

τ ) is normal;

(ii) for every closed subspace (S,

τ 1) of (X, τ ) and each continuous map φ of

(S, τ 1 ) into the open unit interval (0, 1) with the euclidean topology, there
exists a continuous extension Φ : (X, τ ) → (0, 1) of φ.

Proof.

That (ii) implies (i) is proved analagously to that in Proposition 10.3.43.

So assume that (i) is true and that φ is a continuous map of (S,

τ 1) into (0, 1).

We want to find a continuous map Γ : X → (0, 1) such that Γ(x) = φ(x), for all

x ∈ S . By Proposition 10.3.43, there exists a continuous map Φ : (X, τ ) → [0, 1],
such that Φ(x) = φ(x), for all x ∈ X .
Let D = {x : x ∈ X, Φ(x) ∈ {0, 1}}. Then S and D are disjoint closed sets. As

(X, τ ) is a normal space, by Urysohn’s Lemma 10.3.22, there exists a continuous
map θ : (X, τ ) → [ 21 , 1] such that θ(x) = 1 for all x ∈ S , and θ(x) = 21 for all x ∈ D .
So if we define Γ : (X, τ ) → (0, 1) by Γ(x) = Φ(x).θ(x).θ(x) + 1 − θ(x), we can
easily verify that Γ is a continuous extension of φ, as required.

Lemma.

Let (S,

τ 1) be a subspace of the topological space

(X, τ ) and (Y, τ 2 ) and (Z, τ 3 ) homeomorphic topological spaces. If every
continuous map φ : (S, τ 1 ) → (Y, τ 2 ) has a continuous extension Φ : (X, τ ) →
(Y, τ 2 ), then every continuous map γ : (S, τ 2 ) → (Z, τ 3 ) also has a continuous

for x ∈ (0, 1].

Then φ is continuous, but there is no extension of φ to a map

CHAPTER 10. TYCHONOFF’S THEOREM

τ 1) be a dense subspace of a topological
space (X, τ ) and φ : (S, τ 1 ) → (K, τ 2 ) a continuous map of (S, τ 1 ) into a
compact Hausdorff space (K, τ 2 ). The following conditions are equivalent:
(i) the map φ has a continuous extension Φ : (X, τ ) → (K, τ 2 );
(ii) for every pair of closed subsets C1 , C2 of (K, τ 2 ), the inverse images
φ−1 (C1 ) and φ−1 (C2 ) have disjoint closures in (X, τ ).

10.3.53

Proposition.

Let (S,

Firstly assume (i) is true, that is the continuous extension Φ exists. By
continuity, Φ−1 (C1 ) and Φ−1 (C2 ) are closed disjoint sets in (X, ). So
Φ−1 (C1 ) ∩ Φ−1 (C2 ) = Φ−1 (C1 ) ∩ Φ−1 (C2 ) = Ø.
Proof.

τ

Hence (ii) is true.
Now assume that (ii) is true. For every x ∈ X , let N (x) be the set of all open
neighbourhoods of x ∈ (X,

τ ). Let

F(x) = {φ(S ∩ N ) : N ∈ N (x)}
Each member of F(x) is obviously a closed subset of (K,

(1)

τ 2).

We shall verify that F(x) has the finite interesection property, for each x ∈ X .
Let N1 , N2 , . . . , Nn ∈ N (x). Then

φ(S ∩ N1 ) ∩ φ(S ∩ N2 ) ∩ · · · ∩ φ(S ∩ Nn ) ⊇ φ(S ∩ N1 ∩ N2 ∩ · · · ∩ Nn )
As S is dense in (X,

(2)

τ ), it intersects the open set N1 ∩ N2 ∩ · · · ∩ Nn non-trivially.

So S ∩ N1 ∩ N2 ∩ · · · ∩ Nn 6= Ø which implies φ(S ∩ N1 ∩ N2 ∩ · · · ∩ Nn ) 6= Ø. Thus

F(x) has the finite intersection property. As (K, τ 2 ) is compact, Proposition 10.3.2
T
implies that
Fi 6= Ø, for each x ∈ X . Define
\
Fi ∈F(x)
Φ(x) =
Fi , for each x ∈ X.
(3)
Fi ∈F(x)
We need to verify that for each x ∈ X , Φ(x) is a single point, and that

Φ : (X, τ ) → (K, τ 2 ) is continuous. If Φ(x) is a single point, then, by the previous
paragraph, Φ(x) = φ(x), for all x ∈ S .
Suppose that y1 , y2 ∈ Φ(x), for some x ∈ X with y1 6= y2 .

10.3. TYCHONOFF’S THEOREM

As (K,

297

τ 2) is compact Hausdorff, by Remark 10.3.28 it is regular and Hausdorff

and so there exist open neighbourhoods U1 , U2 of y1 , y2 , respectively such that
U1 ∩U2 = Ø. By our assumption, φ−1 (U1 )∩φ−1 (U2 ) = Ø. Putting O1 = X\φ−1 (U1 )
and O2 = X \ φ−1 (U2 ), we have X = O1 ∪ O2 . So x ∈ Oj for j = 1 or j = 2. Since

Uj ∩φ(S\φ−1 (Uj ) = Ø and Uj is an open set in (K, τ ), we have Uj ∩φ(S \ φ−1 (Uj ) =
Ø, which implies that yj ∈
/ φ(S \ φ−1 (Uj )) = φ(S ∩ Oj ) ∈ F(x). By (3), then,
yj ∈
/ Φ(x). This is a contradiction and so our supposition was false, and Φ(x) is a
single point for each x ∈ X .
Our final task is to show that Φ : (X,
open neighbourhood of Φ(x) in (K,

{Φ(x)} =

τ ) → (K, τ 2) is continuous. Let U be an

τ 2). By (1) and (3),
\

φ(S ∩ N ) ⊆ U

(4).

N ∈N (x)
This implies that

S

(K \ φ(S ∩ N ) ⊇ K \ U . As K \ U is compact and each

N ∈N (x)

K \ φ(S ∩ N ) is open, there exist N1 , N2 , . . . , Nk ∈ N (x) such that
(K \ φ(S ∩ N1 )) ∪ (K \ φ(S ∩ N2 )) ∪ · · · ∪ (K \ φ(S ∩ Nk )) ⊇ K \ U.
So

Shrinking Lemma for Normal Spaces
27. For an index set I , let {Ui : i ∈ I} be an open covering of the topological space

(X, τ ). The open covering {Vi : i ∈ I} of (X, τ ) is said to be a shrinking of
the cover {Ui : i ∈ I} if Vi ⊆ Vi ⊆ Ui , for every i ∈ I . Prove the following
results leading to the Shrinking Lemma for Normal Spaces.

τ

Let (X, ) be a normal Hausdorff space.
(i) For each x ∈ X and every open neighbourhood U of x, there exists an open
neighbourhood V of x such that x ∈ V ⊆ V ⊆ U .
(ii) If V is a closed set and U is an open set such that V ⊆ U , then there exists
an open set W such that V ⊆ W ⊆ W ⊆ U . (This property characterizes
normality.)
(iii) Let {U, V } be an open covering of X . Then there exists an open set W
such that W ⊆ W ⊆ U and {W, V } is an open covering of X .
(iv) Every finite open covering of (X, ) has a shrinking; that is, for every

τ

open covering {Ui : i = 1, 2, . . . , n} of X , there exists an open covering

{Vi : i = 1, 2, . . . , n} of X , such that Vi ⊆ Vi ⊆ Ui , for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. (This
property characterizes normality.)
(v)* For every locally finite open covering {Ui : i ∈ N} of X , there exists an open
covering {Vi : i ∈ N} of X , such that Vi ⊆ Vi ⊆ Ui , for i ∈ N.
(Without the assumption that the open covering {Ui : i ∈ N} is locally finite,
the Axiom of Choice can be used to prove this result would be false. This
is related to Dowker spaces, named after Clifford Hugh Dowker
(1912–1982). A Dowker space (X,
which the product space

τ ) is a normal space for

(X, τ ) × [0, 1] is not a normal space.

See Rudin [350].)

(vi)* (Shrinking Lemma for Normal Spaces) For I any index set and

{Ui : i ∈ I} a locally finite open covering of X , there exists an open
covering {Vi : i ∈ I} of X , such that Vi ⊆ Vi ⊆ Ui , for i ∈ I . (C.
H. Dowker proved that if (X, τ ) satisfies the Shrinking Lemma for every
open covering, rather than every locally finite open covering, then it is a
paracompact space - a property introduced in Exercise 29 below.)

Let P and Q be posets. The poset Q is said to be Tukey dominated by P ,
denoted by Q ⩽T P , if there exists a function f : P → Q that maps every
confinal subset of P to a cofinal subset of Q. The posets P and Q are said to
be Tukey equivalent if P ⩽T Q and Q ⩽T P .

τ ) is a topological space, for each point x ∈ X the set Nx of all
neighbourhoods in (X, τ ) of x is a poset if we give it the partial order of reverse
If (X,

inclusion; that is, if N1 , N2 ∈ Nx then N2 ⩽ N1 precisely when N1 ⊆ N2 . So

Nx is a directed lower complete poset. (A poset P is said to be directed if for
every a, b ∈ P , there exists a c ∈ P such that a ⩽ c and b ⩽ c.) For x ∈ X , the
poset Nx is Tukey dominated by ω if and only if the topological space (X, τ ) is
first countable at the point x.
Let P be a poset. The topological space (X, τ ) is said to have a neighbourhood
P -base at the point x ∈ X if the poset Nx of all neighbourhoods of x is Tukey
dominated by P . Since Nx is lower complete, this happens if and only if at
each x ∈ X , the space (X, τ ) has a neighbourhood base {Uα [x] : α ∈ P }
such that Uβ [x] ⊆ Uα [x] for all α ⩽ β ∈ P . If a topological space (X, τ )
has a neighbourhood P -base {Uα : α ∈ P } at each x ∈ X , then these
neighbourhood bases can be encoded by the set {Uα : α ∈ P } of the entourages
Uα = {(x, y) ∈ X × X : y ∈ Uα [x]}, α ∈ P . Such a family {Uα : α ∈ P } is
said to be a P -based topological space. A topological space (X, τ ) has a
neighbourhood P -base at each point if and only if it has a P -base.
Banakh [28], Banakh and Leiderman [29], Gabriyelyan and Ka̧kol [144], Leiderman
et al. [257], and Gabriyelyan et al. [145] study topological spaces, topological
groups and topological vector spaces with an ω ω -base. (Note that by ω ω we
mean the uncountable cardinal number of the set NN with co-ordinatewise
partial ordering ⩽, given by f ⩽ g when f (n) ⩽ g(n), for f, g : N → N and

n ∈ N, not the countable ordinal number.) In some literature these are known
as topological spaces with a G-base.
(i) Let P and Q be posets and f : P → Q. Verify that Q is Tukey dominated
by P if and only if f −1 (B) is bounded in P for every bounded subset B of

P.
(ii) Verify that a poset is Tukey dominated by ω if and only if P is a directed
poset of countable cofinality.

Q are Tukey equivalent.
(v) Verify that a topological space (X,

Banach spaces, Dual Spaces, Weak Topologies, and Reflexivity
33. Let N be a normed vector space over K , which is the field R of real numbers
or C of complex numbers, with norm || ||. A linear map from the underlying
vector space of N into K is said to be a linear functional. Denote the set
of all continuous linear functionals from N into K by N ∗ . If φ, φ1 , φ2 ∈ N ∗
and λ ∈ K , define (φ1 + φ2 )(x) = φ1 (x) + φ2 (x) and (λφ)(x) = λ(φ(x)). With
these operations N ∗ is a vector space over K . Define a norm || ||op on N ∗ by
||φ||op = sup{|φ(x)| : x ∈ N , ||x|| ⩽ 1}, for φ ∈ N ∗ . (op is short for operator.)
(i) Verify that N ∗ , with || ||op , is indeed a normed vector space. (The normed
vector space N ∗ is called the dual space of N .)
(ii) Verify that with this norm, N ∗ is in fact a Banach space.
[Hint: Let φn be a Cauchy sequence of members of N ∗ . For each x ∈ N ,
consider the sequence φn (x) in the field K of scalars. Use the fact that K
is a complete metric space.]
(iii)** Verify each of the following:
(a) if N is Rn , n ∈ N, then N ∗ is isometrically isomorohic to Rn ;

(iv) Consider the double dual N ∗∗ of N ; that is, N ∗∗ = (N ∗ )∗ . Verify that
the natural map Γ : N → N ∗∗ given by Γ(x)(φ) = φ(x), for x ∈ N ,

φ ∈ N∗ is one-to-one, linear and norm preserving; that is, ||Γ(x)||op = ||x||,
for all x ∈ N . Deduce that if N is a Banach space, then the Banach
spaces N and Γ(N ) are isomorphic as Banach spaces; that is, the map
Γ : N → Γ(N ) ⊆ N ∗∗ is one-to-one and onto and an isometric isomrphism
of N onto Γ(N ).
(v) A normed vector space is said to be reflexive if in the notation above,
Γ(N ) = N ∗∗ . Deduce that if N is reflexive, then it is a Banach space and

N and N ∗∗ are isometric Banach spaces.
(vi) Let N be a normed vector space over the scalar field K which is R or C,
as usual. Then the norm on N induces a topology on N which is called the
strong topology. Let N ∗ be the dual space of N , which we have seen is
a Banach space. Obviously the strong topology is such that, by definition,
every φ : N → K , where φ ∈ N ∗ , is continuous. However, there may be

CHAPTER 10. TYCHONOFF’S THEOREM

(vii) [Banach-Alaoglu Theorem] (Leonidas Alaoglu (1914–1981) was a Canadian
mathematician who extended Banach’s result from separable spaces to the
general case.) If N is a normed vector space, then the closed unit ball
of N ∗ is weak*-compact; that is, compact in the weak*-topology on

N ∗ . (This result should be contrasted with that in Exercises 8.3 #3 (vi).)
Prove this theorem by verifying each of the following steps.
(a) Let B ∗ = {φ : φ ∈ N ∗ , ||φ||∗ ⩽ 1} be the closed unit ball of N ∗ , where
|| ||∗ is the norm on N ∗ . Then each linear functional φ ∈ B ∗ maps
the closed unit ball B = {x : x ∈ N, ||x|| ⩽ 1} of N into the disc

D = {c : c ∈ K, |c| ⩽ 1}.
(b) So we can identify B ∗ with a subset of the product space D B . the space
(c) We can readily check that the weak*-topology on B ∗ is in fact the
subspace topology from the product topology on D B .
(d) Indeed, B ∗ is a closed subspace of D B .
(e) As D is compact, Tychonoff ’s Theorem 10.3.4 implies that D B is
compact.
(e) So the closed subspace B ∗ of D B is compact; that is, B ∗ is weak*compact.

(viii) Let K be the real number field R or the complex number field C and V, W
vector spaces over K . A linear operator from V to W is a map φ : V → W
such that φ(λx + µy) = λφ(x) + µφ(y), for all x, y ∈ V and all λ, µ ∈ K . If V
and W are normed vector spaces, a linear operator φ : V → W is said to be
bounded if there exists a positive real number M such that ||φ(x)|| ⩽ M ||x||
for every x ∈ V . Prove that a linear operator φ : V → W is bounded if
and only if it is continuous. The smallest such M is called the operator
norm and denoted || ||op , and the set B(V, W ) of all linear operators from

V to W with this norm || ||op is a normed vector space. (Observe that the
norm || ||op depends on the norms on V and W .) The normed vector space
(B(V, W ), || ||op) is called the space of bounded linear operators. Define
bounded linear functional and deduce from what we just proved that a linear
functional φ : V → K is bounded if and only if it is continuous.

considering functions fn : [0, 1] → R such that fn (0) = n but 0 (fn (x))2 = 1,

(x)* (One-dimensional version of the Hahn-Banach Theorem over R The
Hahn-Banach Theorem was proved independently in the 1920s by the
Austrian mathematician Hans Hahn (1879–1934) and the Polish mathematician
Stefan Banach (1892–1945).) Prove the following lemma.
Lemma.

Let B be a normed vector space, E a vector subspace of B , and

f : E → R a bounded linear functional. Then for any x ∈ B \ E , there
exists a linear functional f1 : E1 = span{E, x1 } → R that extends f (that
is, f (x) = f1 (x), for all x ∈ E ) and satisfies ||f ||op = ||f1 ||op . (If X is a
subset of a vector space L, span(L) denotes the smallest vector subspace
of L which contains X .)
[Hint. If ||f ||op = 0, the result is seen trivially to be true. So we can, without
loss of generality, assume ||f ||op = 1. Now if x ∈ E1 , then x = λx1 + y , for

λ ∈ R and y ∈ E . To define f1 as an extension of f it suffices to choose
an appropriate value of f1 (x1 ) – by appropriate we mean a value such that
||f ||op = ||f1 ||op . Let us put f1 (x1 ) = a1 , so that f1 (λx1 + y) = λa1 + f (y).
It therefore suffices to choose a1 such that |f1 (x)| ⩽ ||x||, for all x ∈ E1 ;
that is,

−||λx1 + y|| ⩽ λa1 + f (y) ⩽ ||λx1 + y|| , for all λ ∈ R and y ∈ E.
This holds for λ = 0 by hypothesis on f , so we can assume λ 6= 0. This
allows us to rewrite the above inequality as

Observe that this implies

So we can choose for a1 any value between sup [−||x1 + z1 || − f (z1 )] and

(xi)* [Hahn-Banach Theorem]

Let B be a normed vector space over

a field K , where K is R or C, and E a vector subspace of B .
If f : M → K is a bounded linear functional, then there exists a
bounded linear function f1 : B → K that extends f . Using (x) above
and Zorn’s Lemma, prove the Hahn-Banach Theorem.
[Hint. For convenience we discuss only the case that K = R. We saw in (x)
above how to extend a bounded linear functional from E to a vector space,
one dimension greater. We could extend once more to a vector space of
dimension 2 greater. Indeed we could do such an extension a finite number
of times. But to extend to a space of uncountable dimension greater, it is
necessary to use the Axiom of Choice or its equivalent, Zorn’s Lemma. Let

B consist of all pairs (N, fN ) such that
(a) N is a vector subspace of B that contains E ;
(b) fN is a bounded linear functional on N ;
(c) fN extends f ; that is fN (x) = f (x) for all x ∈ E ;
(d) ||fN ||op = ||f ||op .
Now put a partial order on B as follows:
(N, fN ) ⩽ (N 0 , fN 0 ) if N ⊆ N 0 and fN 0 extends fN on N .
Complete the proof by considering a totally ordered subset of B , observing
that it has an upper bound, deducing by Zorn’s Lemma that the partial
ordering has a maximal element (NM , fM ) and using (x) to show (NM , fM )
cannot be a maximal element unless BM = B .]

319

Using the

Hahn-Banach Theorem show that there exists a bounded linear functional

f1 : B → R with ||f ||op = 1 and f1 (x1 ) = ||x1 ||.
[Hint. Let E be the vector subspace of B spanned by x1 . Define a linear
functional f on E by f (λx1 ) = λ||x1 ||. Show that f is a bounded linear
functional and ||f ||op = 1. Then extend f to all of B using the Hahn-Banach
Theorem.]
(xiii) Let B be a normed vector space and E a proper closed subspace of B .
Then there exists a bounded linear functional f : B → R with ||f ||op = 1
and f (x) = 0, for all x ∈ E . (This result generalizes that in (xii) above.)
(xiv) Prove the following statement: Let E be a normed vector space. If E ∗
is separable, then E is separable.
[Hint. Noting that the unit sphere in E ∗ is separable, let {fn ∈ E ∗ : n ∈ N}
be a countable dense subset of this unit sphere. Verify that for each n ∈ N,
there exists xn ∈ E with ||xn || = 1 such that |fn (xn )| ⩾ 12 . Then let W be
the closed linear span of {xn : n ∈ N}. The aim is to show that W = B .
Suppose to the contrary that W is a proper closed subspace of B . By (xiii)
there exists an f ∈ B ∗ with ||f ||op = 1 and f (x) = 0, for all x ∈ W . So
f (xn ) = 0, for all n ∈ N. Show that this implies that for all n ∈ N

1
⩽ |fn (xn )| = |fn (xn ) − f (xn )| ⩽ ||fn − f ||op ||xn || = ||fn − f ||op .

But this contradicts the assumption that {fn : n ∈ N} is dense in the unit
sphere of B ∗ .]

CHAPTER 10. TYCHONOFF’S THEOREM

(xv) Let (N, || ||N ) be a normed vector space and E a closed vector subspace
of N . We define an equivalence relation ∼ on N by x ∼ y if x − y ∈ E ,

x, y ∈ N and define N/E to be the set of all these equivalence classes. We
define the map g : N → N/E by g(x) is the equivalence class of x. Define
||z||N/E = inf {||x||N : g(x) = z}. Prove the following:

x∈N
(a) Define the natural vector space structure on N/E induced by the vector
space structure on N . Verify that N/E is indeed a vector space;
(b) || ||N/E is a norm on the vector space N/E ;
(c) g is an open continuous linear operator;
(d) if N is a Banach space, then (N/E, || ||N/E ) is a Banach space.

The normed vector space ||(N/E, || ||N/E ) is said to be the quotient space
of N by E .
(See also quotient (topological) space in Definitions 11.1.1 and quotient
(topological) group in Proposition A5.2.16.)
(xvi) Let N be a normed vector space, E a subset of N . Then E ⊥ is defined to
be {f ∈ N ∗ : f (x) = 0, for all x ∈ E}, and is called the annihilator of E .
Prove that E ⊥ is a closed vector subspace of N ∗ and that E ⊥ = (span E)⊥ .
If F is a subset of N ∗ , then F⊥ is defined to be {x ∈ N : f (x) = 0, ∀f ∈ F }
and is called the pre-annihilator of F . Prove also that F⊥ is a closed vector
subspace of N and F⊥ = (span F )⊥ .

(xvii)* Prove the following statement: Let N be a normed vector space and E
a vector subspace of N . Then
(a) E ∗ is isometrically isomorphic to N ∗ /E ⊥ ;
(b) If E is closed, then (N/E)∗ is isometrically isomorphic to E ⊥ .
(Note that this result for Banach spaces is the analogue of Corollary A5.9.6
and Corollary A5.9.7 in Pontryagin Duality of topological groups.)
[Hint. (a) Let Θ : N ∗ → N ∗ /E ⊥ be the natural mapping. Consider f ∈ E ∗ .
By the Hahn-Banach Theorem there exists a bounded linear functional

f1 : N → R such that f1 is an extension of F and ||f1 ||op = ||f ||op .
Now prove that the map φ : E ∗ → N ∗ /E ⊥ given by φ(f ) = Θ(f1 ) is an
isometry of E ∗ onto N ∗ /E ⊥ .
(b) Let Γ : N → N/E be the natural quotient mapping. Define the map
δ : (N/E)∗ → E ∗ by δ(f ) = f ◦ Γ. Verify that δ is linear and δ(f )(x) = 0,
for all x ∈ E . Deduce from this that δ maps (N/E)∗ into E ⊥ . Now prove
that δ is an isometry of (N/E)∗ onto E ⊥ .]
(xviii) Prove the following statement: Let B be any Banach space and let
Φ : B → B ∗∗ be the canonical linear mapping given by Φ(x)(γ) = γ(x),
for all γ ∈ B ∗ and x ∈ B . Then Φ maps B isometrically onto the
subspace Φ(B) of B ∗∗ .
(xix) Prove the following result: A Banach space B is reflexive if and only if
B ∗ is reflexive.
Firstly consider the case that B is reflexive. As B is reflexive,
the canonical linear operator Φ : B → B ∗∗ is an isometry. Using (xviii)

[Hint.

above, to prove that B ∗ is reflexive, it suffices to show that the canonical
bounded linear operator Ψ from B ∗ to B ∗∗∗ is surjective. Let γ ∈ B ∗∗∗ .
So γ ∈ (Φ(B))∗ ; that is, γ is a bounded linear functional from Φ(B) to R.
Let fγ : B → R be defined by fγ (b) = γ(Φ(b)), for all b ∈ B . Verify that
fγ ∈ B ∗ and that Ψ(fγ ) = γ . This shows that Ψ has the required properties.
Conversely, suppose that B is not reflexive. Then Φ(B) is a proper subspace
of B ∗∗ . Use (xiii) above to obtain a contradiction.]

CHAPTER 10. TYCHONOFF’S THEOREM

(xx) Deduce the following theorem using the Banach-Alaoglu Theorem: The
Banach space B is reflexive if and only if its closed unit ball T is
weakly compact.
[Hint. First use the Banach-Alaoglu Theorem to prove that the closed unit
ball in a reflexive Banach space B is weakly compact. Observe that if B is a
reflexive Banach space, then B = B ∗∗ and the weak topology on B coincides
with the weak*-topology on (B ∗ )∗ = B . Deduce that T is weakly compact.
Conversely assume that T is weakly compact and let T 00 be the closed unit
ball in B ∗∗ . The embedding of B in B ∗∗ is weak-weak* continuous, so the
image of T under this embedding is weak*-compact in B ∗∗ . Using the fact
that the image of T is weak*-dense in T 00 , we can see the image of T is in
fact T 00 . From this it follows that the image of B in B ∗∗ equals B ∗∗ , that
is B is reflexive.]
(xxi) A Banach space B is said to be weakly compactly generated or WCG if
it has a subset S which is weakly compact (that is, compact in the weak
topology on B ) such that the closed linear span of S is B . Prove using
Exercises 8.3 #3(vi) that every separable Banch space is a WCG space
and using (xx) above that every reflexive Banach space is also a WCG
space.
(xxii) Let B be a Banach space and E a closed subspace of B . By considering
the quotient Banach space B/E , show that for any x1 ∈ B \ E there exists
a bounded linear functional fx1 : B → R such that fx1 (y) = 0, for all y ∈ E
but fx1 (x1 ) 6= 0. Deduce that if E is a closed vector subspace of the
Banach space B , then E is a closed subspace of B with its weak
topology.
(xxiii)* Using (xx) prove that every closed subspace of a reflexive Banach space
is a reflexive Banach space.
[Hint. Let B be a reflexive Banach space and E a closed subspace of B . Let

T and S be the closed unit balls in B and E , respectively. As B is reflexive,
T is weakly compact. Using this and (xxii) above, show that S is weakly
compact.]

(xxiv)** Prove that a Banach space B is separable if and only if the closed
unit ball of B ∗ is weak*-metrizable. (This result complements that of
Exercises 8.3 #3 (vi).)
(xxv) In the 1930s the Polish mathematicians Stefan Banach and Stanisław
Mazur (1905–1981) stated a question, which has become known as the
Separable Quotient Problem and is still unanswered. Does every infinitedimensional Banach space have a quotient space which is an infinitedimensional separable Banach space? This has been proved to be true
for a variety of special cases, such as when the infinite-dimensional Banach
space B is reflexive. (For other special cases, see Argyros et al. [14].) To
verify the reflexivity special case, check that the following statements are
true:
(a) Every infinite-dimensional Banach space has a subspace which is an
infinite-dimensional separable Banach space.
(b) Every closed subspace of a reflexive Banach space is reflexive.
(c) If a Banach space B is such that B ∗ is separable, then B is separable.
(d) If a separable reflexive Banach space B , then B ∗ is separable.
(e) If B is any infinite-dimensional reflexive Banach space, then its dual space
B ∗ has an infinite-dimensional separable reflexive Banach subspace E
which implies that B ∗∗ has an infinite-dimensional separable (reflexive)
quotient Banach space E ∗ .
(f ) If B is an infinite-dimensional reflexive Banach space, then B has
an infinite-dimensional separable (reflexive) quotient Banach space.

CHAPTER 10. TYCHONOFF’S THEOREM

(xxvi) A Banach space B is said to an Asplund space, named after Edgar Asplund
(1931–1974), if every separable closed subspace of B has a separable dual.
(a) Using (xxv) above, verify that every reflexive Banach space is an
Asplund space.
(b) Verify that every closed subspace on an Asplund space is an Asplund
space.
(c) Noting that the dual space of the separable Banach space `1 is the nonseparable space `∞ , we see that not every separable Banach space
is an Asplund space.

Deduce that not every weakly compactly

generated space is an Asplund space.
(d) Prove that a separable Banach space B is an Asplund space if and
only if its dual B ∗ is a separable Banach space.
(e) Verify that every Banach space which is a quotient space of an
Asplund space is an Asplund space.
(f ) Verify that every finite product of Asplund spaces is an Asplund
space.
Remarks. (α)

As a generalization of (f ) we mention that being an

Asplund space is a three space property; that is, if B is a Banach
space which has a closed vector subspace E such that E and the quotient
Banch space B/E are Asplund spaces, then B is an Asplund space. (See
Exercises A5.12 #5 where the three space property was introduced.) This
result is Theorem 4.11a of Castillo and González [73].
(β ) If B is a Banach space and the dual space B ∗ is a WCG space, then

B ∗ is an Asplund space. (See Theorem 4.11b of Castillo and González
[73].)
(g) Verify that if B is an infinite-dimensional Asplund space, then its
dual space B ∗ has a quotient space which is an infinite-dimensional
separable Banach space.
(h) Verify that every reflexive Banach space (i) is an Asplund space and
(ii) is the dual of an asplund space. Deduce that (g) above includes
as a special case (xxv)(f ).

10.3. TYCHONOFF’S THEOREM

(i) Prove that if the Banach space B has a subspace E , where E is
an infinite-dimensional Asplund space, then the dual space B ∗ has
a quotient space which is an infinite-dimensional separable Banach
space.

In particular, this is the case if E is a reflexive Banach

space.
(j) Verify from the above that if B is a Banach space which contains as
a subspace c0 or `p , for 1 < p < ∞, or any Hilbert space, then B ∗
has an infinite-dimensional separable quotient Banach space.
(xxvii) Using Exercises 8.3 #3(xi) prove that if the Banach space B has Banach

B1 ⊂ B2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Bi ⊂ · · · ⊂ . . . with each
S
Bi+1 /Bi having dimension 1, and ∞
i=1 Bi dense in B , then B has

an infinite-dimensional separable quotient Banach space.
(xxviii)(a) Let B be an infinite-dimensional Banach space such that its dual space B ∗

show that B ∗∗∗ has a separable infinite-dimensional Banach quotient
space.

Deduce that B ∗∗∗∗∗ , B ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ , etc.

have infinite-dimensional

separable quotient Banach spaces.
(b) Let B be a Banach space with an infinite-dimensional Banach subspace E .
If E ∗ has a separable infinite-dimensional Banach quotient space, show
that B ∗∗∗ has a separable infinite-dimensional Banach quotient space.
Deduce that B ∗∗∗∗∗ , B ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ , etc. have infinite-dimensional separable

Those familiar with category theory should immediately

Freyd Adjoint Functor Theorem using the forgetful functor from the category of
compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous functions to the category of topological
spaces and continuous functions. For a discussion of this see MacLane [269], Freyd
[140]10
While the Stone-C̆ech compactification exists for all topological spaces, it
assumes more significance in the case of Tychonoff spaces.

For the mapping β

this is clear, since the compact Hausdorff space (βX, τ 0 ) is a Tychonoff space and
is an embedding if and only if the space (X,

Suppose β(X) is not dense in (Z,

z0 ∈ Z \ β(X). As (Z, τ 1 ) is a compact Hausdorff space, by Remark 10.3.28, it is a
Tychonoff space.
Observing that Z \β(X) is an open set containing z , we deduce that there exists

τ 1) −→ [0, 1] with Φ1(z0) = 1 and Φ1(β(X)) = {0}.
Also there exists a continuous mapping Φ2 : (Z, τ 1 ) −→ [0, 21 ] with Φ2 (z0 ) = 12 and

a continuous mapping Φ1 : (Z,

Proposition.

Let N have its discrete subspace topology in R and

let βR be the Stone-C̆ech compactification of R. If the closure in βR of N is
denoted by clβ R N , then clβ R N is βN, the Stone-C̆ech compactification of N.

Proof.

Let θ be any continuous map of N into [0, 1]. By the Tietze Extension

Theorem 10.3.51, there is a continuous extension φ : R → [0, 1] of θ . Therefore there
exists a continuous extension Φ : βR → [0, 1] of φ. So Φ|clβ R (N), the restriction
of the map Φ to clβ R N , maps clβ R N to [0, 1] and is a continuous extension of θ .
As N is dense in clβ R N , this is the unique continuous extension. So by Proposition
10.4.12, clβ R N is βN.

card [0, 1]c ⩽ card βN; that is, 2c ⩽ card βN.
By the construction in Proposition 10.4.5, βN is a subspace of [0, 1]I , where I
is the set of (continuous) functions from N to [0, 1]. So card I = cℵ0 = c. Then
card ([0, 1]I ) = cc = 2c . Thus card βN ⩽ 2c . Hence card βN = 2c . The proposition

CHAPTER 10. TYCHONOFF’S THEOREM

10.5

Postscript

At long last we defined the product of an arbitrary number of topological spaces
and proved the general Tychonoff Theorem. (An alternative and more elegant proof
of the Tychonoff Theorem using the concept of a filter appears in Appendix 6.)
We also extended the Embedding Lemma to the general case. This we used to
characterize the Tychonoff spaces as those which are homeomorphic to a subspace
of a cube (that is, a product of copies of [0, 1]).
Urysohn’s Lemma allowed us to obtain the following relations between the
separation properties:

T4 ⇒ T3 1 ⇒ T3 ⇒ T2 ⇒ T1 ⇒ T0 .
2

Further, each of the properties compact Hausdorff and metrizable imply T4 .
We have also seen a serious metrization theorem – namely Urysohn’s Metrization
Theorem, which says that every regular second countable Hausdorff space is
metrizable.
We introduced the Stone-C̆ech compactification, which is a rich and serious topic
of study in its own right. (See Gillman and Jerison [156]; Hindman and Strauss
[187]; Walker [415].)

In order to show that the Stone-C̆ech compactification is

huge, we proved other important resullts. One of these is the Hewitt-MarczewskiPondiczery Theorem 10.3.41 which in particular showed the surprising fact that
a product of c copies of R is separable. In a series of steps we proved the Tietze
Extension Theorem 10.3.51 and stated it in a slightly more general form than is usual
in most books. With the aid of these results we were able to prove, in Proposition
10.4.18, that if X is any unbounded subset of Rn , n ∈ N, then card (βX) = 2c . In
particular, card βN = card βQ = card βR = card βP = 2c .
In Exercises 10.3 #33 we have some beautful results from Banach space Theory.
These include the Banach-Alaoglu Theorem, the Hahn-Banach Theorem, and a
wealth of information on the duals of Banach spaces, the weak topology, the weak*topology on the dual space, reflexive Banach spaces, weakly compactly generated
Banach spaces, the annihilator, quotients of Banach spaces, and the Open Question
known as the Separable Quotient Problem. In particular, we show that every infinite-

10.6. CREDIT FOR IMAGES

337

dimensional reflexive Banach space has a quotient Banach space which is a separable
and infinite-dimensional Banach space. It is known, but not proved here, that every
infinite-dimensional WCG space and every infinite-dimensional dual of a Banach
space has a quotient Banach space which is infinite-dimensional and separable.

Quotient Spaces
Introduction
We have seen how to create new topological spaces from given topological spaces
using the operation of forming a subspace (of a topological space) and the operation
of forming a (finite or infinite) product of a set of topological spaces.

In this

chapter we introduce a third operation, namely that of forming a quotient space (of
a topological space). As examples we shall see the Klein bottle and Möbius strip.

11.1

Quotient Spaces

τ ) and (Y, τ 1) be topological spaces. Then
(Y, τ 1 ) is said to be a quotient space of (X, τ ) if there exists a surjective
mapping f : (X, τ ) → (Y, τ 1 ) with the property (*).
For each subset U of Y , U ∈ τ 1 ⇐⇒ f −1 (U ) ∈ τ .

Proposition.

τ)

Let f be a continuous mapping of a compact space

(X, τ ) onto a Hausdorff space (Y, τ 1 ). Then f is a quotient mapping.

Proof.

We shall use property(**) above. Let A be a subset of Y . If f −1 (A)

is closed in (X,

τ ), then by Proposition 7.2.4 it is compact. As f is continuous,

by Proposition 7.2.1, f (f −1 (A)) is a compact subspace of the Hausdorff space

(Y, τ 1 ), and therefore by Proposition 7.2.5 is closed in (Y, τ 1 ). As f is surjective,
f (f −1 (A)) = A, and we have that A is closed.
Conversely, if A is closed in (Y,
in (X,

τ 1), then by continuity of f , f −1(A) is closed

Hence f has property(**) and so is a quotient mapping.

open in (Y, τ 1 ).

In Exercises 7.2 #5 we saw that there are examples of

Clearly if f : (X,

τ ) → (Y, τ 1) is a surjective, continuous

and open mapping, then it is also a quotient mapping. Similarly if f is a

11.2

Identification Spaces

We begin by recalling the definition of an equivalence relation.
11.2.1

Definitions.

A binary relation ∼ on a set X is said to be an

equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive; that is, for all

a, b, c ∈ X ,
(i) a ∼ a (reflexive);
(ii) a ∼ b =⇒ b ∼ a (symmetric);
(iii) a ∼ b and b ∼ c =⇒ a ∼ c (transitive).
If a, b ∈ X , then a and b are said to be in the same equivalence class if a ∼ b.

11.2.2

Remark.

Note that = is an equivalence relation on the set R of all real

numbers and ∼
= (homeomorphic) is an equivalence relation on any set of topological



spaces.

11.2.3

Remark.

Let X and Y be sets and f a mapping of X onto Y . We can

define an equivalence relation ∼ on the set X as follows:
for a, b ∈ X,

a ∼ b ⇐⇒ f (a) = f (b).

So two points a, b ∈ X are in the same equivalence class if and only if f (a) = f (b).

11.2.4

Remark.

343

Using Remark 11.2.3 we now observe that quotient spaces

arise in a very natural way.
Let (X,

τ ) be any topological space and ∼ any equivalence relation on X . Let

Y be the set of all equivalence classes of ∼. We can denote Y by X/ ∼. The
natural topology to put on the set Y = X/ ∼ is the quotient topology under the
map which identifies the equivalence classes; that is, maps each equivalence class
to a point.
Because of this example, quotient mappings are often called identification
mappings and quotient spaces are often called identification spaces.
Of course, as we have seen in Remark 11.2.3, this example is in fact quite
general, because if f is any mapping of a set X onto a set Y , we can define an
equivalence relation by putting a ∼ b if and only if f (a) = f (b), where a, b ∈ X . 

Intuitively1 , CX is obtained from X × I by pinching X × {0}

to a single point. So we make X into a cylinder and collapse one end to a point.

so Proposition 11.1.10 implies f is a quotient mapping. As f −1 {0} = Sn−1 × {0},

the points X × {1}; that is,

Thus (SX,

τ 2) is the quotient space of (X, τ ) × I where the equivalence relation is
(x, 1) ∼ (x0 , 1) and (x, 0) ∼ (x0 , 0), for all x, x0 ∈ X.

Remark.

It is not always easy to picture a 3-dimensional object, let

alone a 4-dimensional one which cannot exist in 3-dimensional space, such as the
Klein bottle. It is therefore useful and convenient to use 2-dimensional polygonal
representations of figures in higher dimensions, where we adopt a convention for
when edges are identified. A simple example will demonstrate how this is done.

Example.

We represent a cylinder as a square with one pair of opposite

sides identified. So the two sides labelled “b” are identified in such a way that the two
vertices marked “A” are identified and the two vertices marked “B” are identified.

So the cylinder is the quotient space I × I/ ∼, where ∼ is the equivalence relation
on I × I given by (t, 0) ∼ (t, 1), for all t ∈ I .

11.3.4

CHAPTER 11. QUOTIENT SPACES

Examples.

The real projective plane, denoted by RP2 , is defined to

be the quotient space I × I/ ∼, where ∼ is the equivalence relation (0, t) ∼ (1, 1 − t)
and (t, 0) ∼ (1 − t, 1), for all t ∈ I .

This is not a subspace of R3 , that is, it cannot be embedded in 3-dimensional
euclidean space (without crossing itself ).
While it is not immediately obvious, RP2 can be thought of as the space of all lines
through the origin, but excuding the origin, in R3 . Each line is of course determined
by a non-zero vector in R3 , unique up to scalar multiplication. RP2 is then the
quotient space of R3 \ {0} under the equivalence relation v ∼ λv , for all λ ∈ R,

λ 6= 0. (See also Definitions A5.0.1 and the following discussion.)
In fact, we can generalize this to real projective space, denoted by RPn . Let
X = Rn+1 \ {(0, 0, . . . , 0)}. Give X the topology as a subspace of Rn+1 .

τ

Then RPn is the quotient space (X,

τ )/∼, where the equivalence relation ∼ is given

by (a1 , a2 , . . . , an+1 ) ∼ (b1 , b2 , . . . , bn+1 ), if there exists a λ ∈ R \ {0}, such that

bi = λai , for i = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1.
Let φ : (X, τ ) → RPn be the quotient/identification map. Since Sn ⊆ X , we can
consider the restriction of φ to Sn , namely φ : Sn → RPn . Since

Sn , we see that the map φ : Sn → RPn is surjective. It is continuous and, by the
compactness of Sn , is a quotient map. Clearly if a, b ∈ Sn , then
φ(a) = φ(b) ⇐⇒ a = (a1 , a2 , . . . , an+1 ) and b = (−a1 , −a2 , . . . , −an+1 );
that is, a and b are antipodal points. (Antipodal points on a sphere are those which
are diametrically opposite.) So RPn ∼

on Sn which identifies antipodal points.

Postscript

In this chapter we introduced the important notions of quotient space and its
associated quotient mapping or identification mapping.

We noted that every

continuous mapping of a compact space onto a Hausdorff space is a quotient
mapping.

Quotients were used to produce new and interesting spaces including

cylinders, cones, the Klein bottle, real projective spaces and the Möbius strip. We
introduced the cone and suspension which are of relevance to study in algebraic
topology. In the final section we showed how to use polygonal representations to
define figures such as the Klein bottle which cannot be embedded in 3-dimensional
euclidean space.
This short chapter is but the smallest taste of what awaits you in further study
of topology.

The Stone-Weierstrass Theorem
Introduction
Section 1 is devoted to the Weierstrass Theorem,
proved by Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897) in 1885
when he was aged 70. It is a very powerful theorem,
with very many applications even to this day. Over
the next 30 years there was a variety of proofs by

Weierstrass

Stone

Výborný

famous mathematicians. In 1964 Kuhn [245], gave
an elementary proof using the Bernoulli inequality
(named after Jacob Bernoulli (1655–1705)).
In Section 1 we give a quite elementary1 proof
using the Bernoulli inequality. The proof we present
here is primarily due to my teacher, Rudolf Výborný
in his paper Výborný [414] but is also influenced by
the presentation of Păltineanu [333] which was also
influenced by Výborný [414].
In Section 2, we prove the generalization of the Weierstrass Theorem first proved
in 1937 by Marshall Harvey Stone (1903–1989), Stone [384], and with a simpler proof
in 1948, Stone [385]. This elegant generalization is known as the Stone-Weierstrass
Theorem.
The beautiful Stone-Weierstrass Theorem is a theorem in Pure Mathematics
but has very important applications.

12.1. THE WEIERSTRASS APPROXIMATION THEOREM

12.1

355

The Weierstrass Approximation Theorem

We begin by stating and proving the Bernoulli inequality which was named after the
Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli (1654–1705).

12.1.1

Proposition.

Let x ∈ R such that x ⩾ −1, and n ∈ N. Then

(1 + x)n ⩾ 1 + nx.

Proof.

This is proved using mathematical induction.

Clearly it is true if n = 1.
Assume that for some integer k , (1 + x)k ⩾ 1 + kx, for all x ⩾ −1.

Then (1 + x)k+1 = (1 + x)k .(1 + x)

⩾ (1 + kx).(1 + x),

by the inductive assumption

= 1 + kx + kx + kx2
⩾ 1 + kx + kx

= 1 + (k + 1)x,

as required.

So if the Bernoulli inequality is true for n = k , then it is true for n = k + 1. Thus
by mathematical induction, the Bernoulli inequality is true for all n ∈ N.
We shall prove the Weierstrass Theorem on Polynomial Approximation.

The Weierstrass Approximation Theorem.

If f : [a, b] → C is a

continuous function and ε is a positive real number, then there exists a
polynomial P such that |f (x) − P (x)| < ε, for all x ∈ [a, b].

356

CHAPTER 12. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

If you think about this, you can see that it is quite surprising. It says that no
matter how strange a continuous function may be, it can be approximated as close
as we like by a very nice simple function, namely a polynomial2 . Not only is this
result quite surprising, it is very useful in practical applications.
We shall prove the Weierstrass Approxmation Theorem with C replaced by R,
from which the Theorem easily follows. The main idea of the proof is to show
that if f can be approximated by a polynomial on some interval, then it can be
approximated by a polynomial on a slightly larger interval. To show this we shall use
the following lemma.
First we mention a definition:

12.1.2

Definition.

Let an ∈ C and b ∈ C, for each n ∈ N. If for each

ε > 0, there exists an Nε ∈ N such that |an − b| < ε, for n ⩾ Nε , then the
sequence of complex numbers an is said to have b as its limit. This is denoted
by lim an = b or equivalently an → b.
n→∞

2

Even if the function f is continuous but nowhere differentiable, it can be approximated by an
infinitely differentiable function, namely a polynomial.
This remarkable result is not to be confused with Taylor polynomials or Taylor series which require
f to be not just differentiable but infinitely differentiable. See Exercises 10.3 #28(vii).

By (4) there exists n1 ∈ N such that pn1 (x) > 1 − η , for all x ∈ [a, d] and by (5)
there exists n2 ∈ N such that pn2 (x) < η , for all x ∈ [c, b]. Putting n equal to the
greater of n1 and n2 , we have that (4) and (5) imply (2) and (3), which completes
the proof of the Lemma.

12.1.5

Theorem. [The Weierstrass ApproximationTheorem]

If f : [a, b] → C is a continuous function and ε is a positive real number, then
there exists a polynomial P such that

|f (x) − P (x)| < ε, for all x ∈ [a, b].

Proof.

(6)

Let g(x) = <(f (x)) and h(x) = =(f (x)) the real and imaginary parts of

f (x) respectively, for x ∈ [a, b], so that g and h are continuous functions from [a, b]
into R.
If there exist polynomials Pg and Ph such that for all x ∈ [a, b], |g(x)−Pg (x)| < 2ε
and |h(x) − Ph (x)| < 2ε , then putting P (x) = Pg (x) + iPh (x) we have that the
polynomial P satisfies |f (x) − P (x)| < ε.
So to prove this theorem, it suffices to prove it for the special case:

f is a continuous function of [a, b] into R.
We shall now assume, without loss of generality, that f is indeed a continuous
function of [a, b] into R.
For the given ε > 0, let Sε be the set of all t ⩽ b such that there exists a
polynomial Pε with the property that

|f (x) − Pε (x)| < ε, for all x ∈ [a, t].

(7)

We need to show Sε is not the empty set.
By continuity of f , there exists t0 > a such that

|f (x) − f (a)| < ε, for all x ∈ [a, t0 ].

(8)

12.1. THE WEIERSTRASS APPROXIMATION THEOREM

361

Consequently, f can be approximated by the constant function f (x) = f (a) on

[a, t0 ], so Sε 6= Ø.
Let s = sup Sε . Clearly a < s ⩽ b.
The proof of the Theorem will be complete if we can prove that s = b.
By continuity of f at s, there is a δ > 0 such that

|f (x) − f (s)| ⩽

ε
, for s − δ ⩽ x ⩽ s + δ and a ⩽ x ⩽ b.
3

(9)

By the definition of supremum, there is a c with s − δ ⩽ c ⩽ s and c ∈ Sε . This
means that there is a polynomial Pε satisfying (7) for x ∈ [a, c]. Let

m = max{|f (x) − Pε (x)| : a ⩽ x ⩽ c}.
So

m < ε.

(10)

Recall Proposition 7.2.15 says that if φ is a continuous function from [a, b] into

R, then φ([a, b]) = [v, w], for some v, w ∈ R.
As the function f and the polynomial Pε are continuous on [a, b], the function

φ defined by φ(x) = |f (x) − Pε (x)| + |f (x) − f (s)| is continuous on [a, b]. So
φ([a, b]) = [v, w], for some v, w ∈ R. Therefore we can choose M ∈ R such that
M > |f (x) − Pε (x)| + |f (x) − f (s)|, for all x ∈ [a, b]

(11).

Apply Lemma 12.1.4 to find a polynomial pn satisfying (1), (2) and (3).
Now we define the required polynomial P by

P (x) = f (s) + |Pε (x) − f (s)]pn (x).

and we shall show that it satisfies condition (6) of the statement of the Theorem.

CHAPTER 12. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

First we have

|f (x) − P (x)| = f (x) − f (s) − [Pε (x) − f (s)]pn (x)
= [f (x) − Pε (x)]pn (x) + [f (x) − f (x)pn (x) − f (s) + f (s)pn (x)]
= [f (x) − Pε (x)]pn (x) + [(f (x) − f (s))(1 − pn (x)]
⩽ f (x) − Pε (x) pn (x) + |f (x) − f (s) (1 − pn (x))

⩽ |f (x) − Pε (x)| + |f (x) − Pε (x)| + |f (x) − f (s)| (1 − pn (x))
⩽ m + M η , by (10), (11) and (2) as [a, s − δ] ⊆ [a, c]
< ε , by (12).
(15)
On the interval [s − δ, c]

|f (x) − P (x)| ⩽ f (x) − Pε (x) pn (x) + |f (x) − f (s) (1 − pn (x)), by (14)

⩽ εpn (x) + (1 − pn (x)), by (10) and (9) noting that

(16)
On the interval [c, s + δ] ∩ [c, b] we have

|f (x) − P (x)| ⩽ f (x) − Pε (x) pn (x) + |f (x) − f (s) (1 − pn (x)), by (14)

(17)
By (15),(16), and (17), we have

|f (x) − P (x)| < ε,

for all x ∈ [a, s + δ] ∩ [c, b].

(18)

Suppose s < b. Then (18) contradicts the definition of s as the supremum
of the set Sε . So s = b; that is, [a, s] = [a, b], which completes the proof of the
Theorem.

In the literature there are

many somewhat different proofs of the Weierstrass
Approximation Theorem 12.1.5. Our proof above,
uses proof by contradiction which is avoided in
the constructive proof using Bernstein Polynomials,
discovered in 1912 by the Russian mathematician
Sergei Natanovich Bernstein (1880–1968),

and

which is motivated by probability theory. Bernstein

CHAPTER 12. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

12.1.7

Remark.

It is worth mentioning that

Bernstein polynomials are at the heart of what are
known as Bézier curves used in graphics.

They

were developed by the French mathematician Paul
de Casteljau (1930–) at Citroën and the French
engineer Pierre Bézier (1910–1999) at Renault who
used them to design car bodies.

Today this

mathematics is at the core of computer graphics
and CAD/CAM (computer-aided-design/computeraided manufacturing).

Quoting from “The first

years

and

of

CAD/CAM

the

UNISURF

System” by Pierre Bézier, in Piegl [325]:

Casteljau

CAD
In the

words of Pierre Bézier himself: There is no doubt
that Citroën was the first company in France that
paid attention to CAD, as early as 1958. Paul de
Casteljau, a highly gifted mathematician, devised a
system based on the use of Berstein polynomials

. . . the system devised by de Casteljau was oriented
towards translating already existing shapes into
patches, defined in terms of numerical data.

Bezier

...

Due to Citroën’s policy, the results obtained by de Casteljau were not published until
1974, and this excellent mathematician was deprived of part of the well deserved
fame that his discoveries and inventions should have earned him.
We can deduce a stronger version of The Weierstrass Approximation Theorem
12.1.6 as a corollary of the theorem itself. If P is such that P (x) = a0 +a1 x+. . . an xn ,
where each aj = rj + isj , where aj and bj are rational (real) numbers for j ∈

{1, 2, . . . , n}, then the polynomial P is said to have rational number coefficients.
12.1.8

Corollary.

If f : [a, b] → C is a continuous function and ε is a

positive real number, then there exists a polynomial P with rational number
coefficients such that |f (x) − P (x)| < ε, for all x ∈ [a, b].
Proof.

Let C[0, 1] be the set of all continuous functions of

[0, 1] into R. If τ is the topology on C[0, 1] induced by the supremum metric in
Example 6.1.6, then
(i) the set of all polynomials is dense in (C[0, 1],

(ii) the set of all polynomials with rational number coefficients is dense in

(iv) the cardinality of C[0, 1] is 2ℵ0 .

Proof.

Exercise.

To make the proof of The Weierstrass Approximation Theorem 12.1.5 as
elementary as we could, we avoided any mention of uniform convergence.

But

we do mention it now before completing this section.

12.1.10

Definition.

Let S be any subset of R and pn , n ∈ N, a sequence

of functions S → C. Then pn , n ∈ N is said to be pointwise convergent to a
function f : S → C if given any x ∈ S and any ε > 0, there exists N (x, ε) ∈ N
such that

|f (x) − pn (x)| < ε, for every n ∈ N such that n > N (x, ε).

Note that the notation N (x, ε) means that this number depends on both x and

ε. Contrast this definition with the next one.
12.1.11

Definition.

Let S be any subset of R and pn , n ∈ N, a sequence

of functions S → C. Then pn , n ∈ N, is said to be uniformly convergent to a
function f : S → C if given any ε > 0, there exists N (ε) ∈ N such that

|f (x) − pn (x)| < ε, for every x ∈ S and n ∈ N such that n > N (ε).

12.1.13

Remark.

We can now restate The Weierstrass Approximation Theorem

12.1.5:
If f : [a, b] → C is a continuous function, then there exists a sequence pn , n ∈ N,
of polynomials on [a, b] which is uniformly convergent to f .
12.1.14

Remark.

Having seen in the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem

12.1.5 that a continuous function can always be approximated by a polynomial, it is
perhaps appropriate to underline the difference in behaviour of continuous functions
and polynomials, indeed of (i) continuous functions, (ii) analytic functions (iii) C ∞
functions and (iv) polynomials. we begin with some definitions.

12.1.15

Definitions.

Let U be an open subset of R. A function f : U → R

is said to be smooth if it is infinitely differentiable at every point x0 ∈ U . The
function f is said to be analytic at a point x0 ∈ U if there exists an open
neighbourhood O ⊆ U of x0 such that f is infinitely differentiable at every

x ∈ O, and the Taylor series

converges (pointwise) to f (x) for all x in O , where f (n) (x0 ) denotes the nth
derivative of f evaluated at x0 . The function f is said to be analytic on R if
it is analytic at every x0 ∈ R.

The set of analytic functions on R properly contains the set of all polynomials
on R, but is a proper subset of the set C ∞ of smooth (ie infinitely differentiable)

of zeros of f ; that is, Z = {x : x ∈ R such that f (x) = 0}.
(i) If f is a non-constant polynomial, then Z is a finite set.
(ii) If f is a non-constant analytic function, then Z is a discrete subspace of R.
(iii) If Z is any closed subset of R, then a C ∞ function f can be chosen with Z
its set of zeros.

Proof.

Having discussed differentiability of a function f : R → R,
we conclude this section by discussing differentiability3 of a function f : Rn → Rm ,

a topic that is needed for the important study of differentiable manifolds.
Recall that a function f : R → R is said to be differentiable at a point x0 ∈ R if
there exists a number f 0 (x0 ) ∈ R such that for h ∈ R

f (x0 + h) − f (x0 )
h

converges to

f 0 (x0 )

as h → 0.

We usually write this as

f (x0 + h) − f (x0 )
= f 0 (x0 ).

We reformulate this so that it can be generalized in a natural way to higher
dimensional euclidean space.
If we define a linear transformation λ : R → R by λ(h) = f 0 (x0 )h, then equation (1)
becomes

f (x0 + h) − (f (x0 ) + λ(h))
= 0.

CHAPTER 12. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

Definition.
Let U be an open subset of Rn , n ∈ N. A function
f : U → Rm , m ∈ N, is said to be differentiable at a point x0 ∈ U , if
there exists an open neighbourhood O ⊆ U of x0 such that for some linear

where h ∈ Rn and |.| denotes the euclidean norm both in Rn and Rm . The

Proposition.
Let U be an open subset of Rn , n ∈ N. If
f : U → Rm , m ∈ N, is differentiable at x0 ∈ U , then there is a unique

At this stage, the unique linear transformation in Proposition 12.1.19 and
Definition 12.1.18 is somewhat mysterious. We proceed to remove that mystery.

0
g (r), the derivative of the function g at ri .
Proposition.
Let U be an open subset of Rn , n ∈ N, and
f : U → Rm , m ∈ N. Put f = (f 1 , f 2 , . . . , f m ), where each f i : U → R.
If f is differentiable at x0 ∈ U , then Dj f i (x0 ) exists for 1 ⩽ i ⩽ m, 1 ⩽ j ⩽ n
and f 0 (x0 ) is the m × n matrix (Dj f i (x0 )).

We now see that it is quite straightforward to calculate the derivative of a
differentiable function mapping Rn into Rm . For a much more detailed discussion

The Stone-Weierstrass Theorem

In §1 we saw that the set of polynomials can be used to approximate any continuous
function of [0, 1] into R, or put differently, the set of all polynomials is dense in

C([0, 1], R) with the supremum metric. We immediately saw generalizations of this,
namely that the smaller set of all Bernstein polynomials is dense in C([0, 1], R) as is
the set of all polynomials with rational number coefficients. So we might ask: which
subsets of C([0, 1], R) are dense? But we shall see much more.
The Stone-Weierstrass Theorem addresses the more general problem of identifiying
the dense subsets of C(X, R) and C(X, C), where X is a compact Hausdorff space.
The Weierstrass Approximation Theorem 12.1.5 is a special case.

To address this problem we shall introduce some new concepts and definitions
which are of importance in their own right. First, we make an insightful observation.

374

CHAPTER 12. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

12.2.1

Definition.

Let S be a set of functions from a set X into a set Y .

Then S is said to separate points (of X ) if for each a, b ∈ S with a 6= b, there
exists a φ ∈ S such that φ(a) 6= φ(b).

12.2.2

Examples.

(a) The set of all real-valued polynomials separates points of [0, 1] as for any

a, b ∈ [0, 1] with a 6= b, the polynomial p given by p(x) = x, for all x ∈ [0, 1] is
such that pa (a) = a 6= b = p(b).
(b) The set of all real-valued Bernstein polynomials separates points of [0, 1] as for
any a, b ∈ [0, 1] with a 6= b, the Bernstein polynomial B1 (f ), where f (x) = x, for
all x ∈ [0, 1], is readily seen to satisfy B1 (f ) = f . So (B1 (f ))(a) 6= (B1 (f ))(b).
(c) On the other hand, the set {fn : fn (x) = sin(2πnx), x ∈ [0, 1], n ∈ N} of
functions of [0, 1] into R does not separate the points 0 and 1, since

fn (0) = sin(0) = 0 = sin(2πn) = fn (1), for all n ∈ N.
Our next proposition gives us a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a
subset S of C[0, 1] to be dense, namely that it separates points of [0, 1]. Indeed it
provides a necessary condition for a subset S of C(X, F ) to be dense, for F equal
to R or C, and X a compact Hausdorff space.

12.2. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

12.2.3

Proposition.

Let (X,

375

τ ) be a compact Hausdorff space, F equal

to R or C, and S a subset of C(X, F ), the set of all continuous function of

(X, τ ) into F with the topology induced by the supremum metric. If S is dense
in C(X, F ), then S separates points of X .

Proof.

Suppose S does not separate points of X . Then there exist a, b ∈ X with

a 6= b such that φ(a) = φ(b), for all φ ∈ S . As S is dense in C(X, F ), for each ε > 0
and each f ∈ C(X, F ), there exists a φ ∈ S such that
sup |f (x) − φ(x)| < ε.
x∈X
As X is compact Hausdorff, there is a continuous function f ∈ C(X, F ) such
that f (a) = 0 and f (b) = 1, and put ε = 31 . So we have

1
|f (a) − φ(a)| < ε = ,
3
1
and |f (b) − φ(b)| < ε = .

(19)
(20)

Now 1 = |f (b) − f (a)| = |(f (b) − φ(b)) + (φ(b) − f (a))|

= |(f (b) − φ(b)) + (φ(a) − f (a))|, as φ(a) = φ(b)
⩽ |f (b) − φ(b)| + |φ(a) − f (a)|

< , by (19) and (20).

As it is not true that 1 < 23 , we have a contradiction and so our supposition that

S does not separate points of C(X, F ) is false, which completes the proof of the
proposition.

CHAPTER 12. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

We now define the notion of an algebra over F , where F = R or F = C. It is
roughly speaking a vector space with a multiplication of vectors. So an algebra is a
set together with operations of addition, scalar multiplication, and multiplication.

12.2.4

Definitions.

Let F be the field R or C. An algebra A over F is

a vector space over F together with a multiplication, that is a binary operation

· : A × A → A such that for any x, y, z ∈ A and α, β ∈ F :
(i) (x + y) · z = x · y + x · z;
(ii) x · (y + z) = x · y + x · z; and
(iii) (αx) · (βy) = (αβ)(x · y).
The algebra A is said to be a unital algebra over F if there exists an identity
element I ∈ A such that I · x = x · I = x, for all x ∈ A.
The algebra A is said to be an associative algebra over F if x·(y ·z) = (x·y)·z ,
for all x, y, z ∈ A.
The algebra A is said to commutative if x · y = y · x, for all x, y ∈ A.

12.2.5

Example.

For each n ∈ N, the set Mn of all n × n matrices with

real number entries is an algebra over R, where the multiplication · is matrix
multiplication. This algebra is unital and associative but not commutative (Exercises
12.2 #2).

C(X, R) is an algebra over the vector space R if we define ·
as follows: for f, g ∈ C(X, R) and α ∈ R, f + g , αf , and f · g are given by

12.2.6

Example.

(f + g)(x) = f (x) + g(x), for all x ∈ R
(αf )(x) = α(f (x), for all x ∈ R
(f · g)(x) = f (x)g(x), for all x ∈ R.
Indeed C(X, R) is a commutative associative unital algebra, where the identity I is
the function f (x) = 1, for all x ∈ R.

12.2. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

12.2.7

377

Let S be a subset of an algebra A. If S is itself an

Definition.

algebra with the operations of addition of vectors, scalar multiplication, and the
binary operation · of A, then S is called a subalgebra of A.

12.2.8

Example.

(i) The set P of all polynomials on [0, 1] is a unital subalgebra of the algebra

(C[0, 1], R);
(ii) The set of all Bernstein polynomials on [0, 1] is a unital subalgebra of the algebra

(C[0, 1], R);
(iii) Let A be a subalgebra of (C[0, 1], R) containing the identity function fI and the
constant function f1 , where fI is given by fI (x) = x, for all x ∈ [0, 1], and the
constant function f1 is given by f1 (x) = 1, for all x ∈ [0, 1]. Then A contains

P [Exercise].
(iv) It follows immediately from (iii) above and Proposition 12.1.9 (i) that the algebra

A in (iii) above is dense in (C[0, 1], R).
12.2.9

Definitions.

Let A be an associative algebra over F , where F is R

or C. Let A also be a normed vector space over F with norm || ||. Then A is
a normed algebra if for all x, y ∈ A, ||x · y|| ⩽ ||x|| ||y||.
If the norm || || is also complete, that is A is a Banach space, then the normed
algebra is called a Banach algebra.

12.2.10

Remark.

it is readily seen that if A is a normed algebra, then the

multiplication · : A × A → A is a continuous mapping.
12.2.11

Example.

For any n ∈ N, and F equal to R or C, F n with the

norm ||x|| = |x|, for all x ∈ F , is a Banach algebra if multiplication is given by

(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )·(y1 , y2 , . . . , yn ) = (x1 y1 , x2 y2 , . . . , xn yn ), for (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ), (y1 , y2 , . . . , yn )
F n . (Exercise).

CHAPTER 12. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

12.2.12

Proposition.

Let X be a compact Hausdorff space and F equal to

either C or R. Then C(X, F ) is a unital Banach algebra if for each f ∈ C(X, F ),

||f || = sup |f (x)|.
x∈X

Proof.

Exercise.

For completeness here, we repeat the definition of a partial order in a set which
appeared in Definitions 10.2.1 (See Davey and Priestley [97].)

12.2.13

Definition.

A partial order on a set X is a binary relation,

denoted by ⩽, which has the properties:
(i) x ⩽ x, for all x ∈ X

(reflexive)

(ii) if x ⩽ y and y ⩽ x, then x = y , for x, y ∈ X
(iii) if x ⩽ y and y ⩽ z , then x ⩽ z , for x, y, z ∈ X

(antisymmetric), and
(transitive)

The set X equipped with the partial order ⩽ is called a partially ordered set
and denoted by (X, ⩽). If x ⩽ y and x 6= y , then we write x < y .

12.2. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

12.2.14

Definitions.

379

Let X be a non-empty partially ordered set and let

S ⊆ X . An element u ∈ X is said to be an upper bound of S if s ⩽ u, for
every s ∈ S .
The element l ∈ X is said to be a lower bound of S if l ⩽ s, for
every s ∈ S .
If the element x

∈

x

∈

X is an upper bound of S and is such that
x ⩽ u for each upper bound u of S , then x is said to be the least upper
bound of S .
X is a lower bound of S and is such that
l ⩽ x for each lower bound l of S , then x is said to be the greatest
lower bound of S .

If

the

element

Let x, y ∈ X and put S = {x, y}.

If the least upper bound of S exists,

then it is denoted by x ∨ y .
Let x, y ∈ X and put S = {x, y}.

If the greatest lower bound of S

exists, then it is denoted by x ∧ y .
If x ∨ y and x ∧ y exist for all x, y ∈ X , then X is said to be a lattice.
Let L be a lattice with partial order ⩽. If S is a subset of L, then S is said to
be a sublattice of L if S with the partial order ⩽ is also a lattice.

12.2.15

Example.

Let X be any compact Hausdorff space and f, g ∈ C(X, R).

Then C(X, R) is a partially ordered set if f ⩽ g is defined to mean f (x) ⩽ g(x), for
each x ∈ X . Indeed, noting that

(f ∨ g)(x) = max{f (x), g(x)}
(f ∧ g)(x) = min{f (x), g(x)},
we see that C(X, R) is a lattice.

380

CHAPTER 12. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

12.2.16

Remark.

We now begin our proof of the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem

in earnest. The proof follows that in Simmons [362]. The first step is to prove a
version of the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem for certain sublattices of C(X, R). Then
we use the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem 12.1.5 to prove that any closed
subalgebra of C(X, R) is a sublattice of C(X, R).

Then it is easy to prove the

Stone-Weierstrass Theorem for C(X, R). Finally we prove the Stone-Weierstrass
Theorem for C(X, C).
12.2.17

Proposition.

Let X be a compact Hausdorff space with more than

one point and let L be a closed sublattice of C(X, R). If L has the property
that for any x, y ∈ X with x 6= y and any a, b ∈ R, there exists φ ∈ L such that

φ(x) = a and φ(y) = b, then L = C(X, R).
Proof.

Let f ∈ C(X, R). We need to show that f ∈ L.

Let ε > 0 be given. Since L is closed in C(X, R), it suffices to find a function

g ∈ L such that |f (x) − g(x)| < ε, for all x ∈ X , as this implies that
||f − g|| = sup{|f (x) − g(x)| : x ∈ X} < ε
and so L is dense (and closed) in C(X, R).
Fix a point x ∈ X and let y ∈ X , y 6= x. By our assumption on L, there
exists a function φy ∈ L such that φy (x) = f (x) and φy (y) = f (y). Let Oy be
the open set given by Oy = {t : t ∈ X, φy (t) < f (t) + ε}. Clearly x, y ∈ Oy . So

{Oy : y ∈ X} is an open covering of the compact space X . So there is a finite
subcover O1 , O2 , . . . , On of X . If the corresponding functions in L are denoted by
φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φn , the function
Φx = φ1 ∧ φ2 ∧ · · · ∧ φn ∈ L
and Φx (x) = x and Φx (t) < f (t) + ε, for all t ∈ X .
For each x ∈ X , define the open set Ux = {t : t ∈ X, Φx (t) > f (t) − ε}. Since

x ∈ Ux , the sets Ux , x ∈ X are an open covering of the compact space X . So there
is a finite subcover U1 , U2 , . . . , Um of X . We denote the corresponding functions in
L by Φ1 , Φ2 , . . . , Φm . Define a function g ∈ L by
g = Φ1 ∨ Φ2 · · · ∨ Φm .

12.2. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

381

It is clear that f (t) − ε < g(t) < f (t) + ε, for all t ∈ X , which completes our
proof.

12.2.18

Lemma.

Let X be any compact Hausdorff space, f ∈ C(X, R)

and |f | defined by |f |(x) = |f (x)|, for every x ∈ X .
(i) |f | ∈ C(X, R);
(ii) f ∧ g = 21 (f + g − |f − g|), for all f, g ∈ C(X, R);
(iii) f ∨ g = 21 (f + g + |f − g|), for all f, g ∈ C(X, R);
(iv) let A be any vector subspace of C(X, R) with the property that

f ∈ A =⇒ |f | ∈ A. Then A is a sublattice of C(X, R).

Proof.

Exercise

12.2.19

Proposition.

Let X be a compact Hausdorff space. Then every

closed subalgebra of C(X, R) is a closed sublattice of C(X, R).

Proof.

Let A be a closed subalgebra of C(X, R). If f, g ∈ C(X, R). By Lemma

7.2.18 (iv) it suffices to show that f ∈ A =⇒ |f | ∈ A.
Let ε > 0 be given.

For any f ∈ C(X, R), define the the closed interval

[a, b] ⊂ R, where a = −||f || and b = ||f ||. The function φt : [a, b] → R given
by φt = |t|, for t ∈ [a, b] is a continuous function. from [a, b] into R. So by the
Weierstrass Theorem 12.1.5, there exists a polynomial p0 such that | |t| − p0 (t) | < 2ε ,
for every t ∈ [a, b].
Define the polynomial p by p(t) = p0 (t) − p0 (0), for all t ∈ [a, b], and note that
|p0 (0)| < 2ε . So we have p(0) = 0 and
| |t| − p(t) | = | |t| − p0 (t) + p0 (0) | ⩽ | |t| − p0 (t) | + |p0 (0)| < ε, for every t ∈ [a, b].
Since A is an algebra, the function p(f ) ∈ C(X, R), given by (p(f ))(x) = p(f (x))
for all x ∈ X , is in A. Since f (x) ∈ [a, b], for all x ∈ X , the previous paragraph
implies that | |f (x)|−p(f (x)) | < ε, for all x ∈ X . So || |f |−p(f ) || < ε. As p(f ) ∈ A
and A is a closed set, this implies that |f | ∈ A, which completes the proof.

CHAPTER 12. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

12.2.20

Theorem.

[The (Real) Stone-Weierstrass Theorem]

Let X

be a compact Hausdorff space and A a closed subalgebra of C(X, R) which
contains a non-zero constant function. Then A = C(X, R) if and only if A
separates points of X .

Proof.

Firstly, from Proposition 12.2.3, if A = C(X, R) then A must separate

points of X .
We now consider the case that A separates points of X .
If X has only one point, then each f ∈ C(X, R) is a constant function and as

A contains a non-zero constant function and is an algebra, it contains all constant
functions and so equals C(X, R).
So consider the case that X has more than one point. By Proposition 12.2.17
and Proposition 12.2.19 it suffices to show that if x, y ∈ X with x 6= y and a, b ∈ R,
there exists f ∈ A such that f (x) = a and f (y) = b. As A separates points of X ,
there exis a g ∈ A, such that g(x) 6= g(y). So we define f : X → R by

f (z) = a

g(z) − g(y)
g(z) − g(x)
+b
, for z ∈ X.
g(x) − g(y)
g(y) − g(x)

Then f has the required properties, which completes the proof.

12.2.21

Remark.



If f : X → C is any function from a set X into C, then we

can write f (x) = R(f )(x) + i I(f )(x), where R(f )(x) ∈ R and I(f )(x) ∈ R. So

f = R(f ) + i I(f ). The conjugate function, f is defined to be R(f ) − i I(f ).
Note that

R(f ) =

f +f
f −f
and I(f ) =
.

12.2. THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM

12.2.22

Theorem.

383

[The (Complex) Stone-Weierstrass Theorem]

Let X be a compact Hausdorff space and A a closed subalgebra of C(X, C)
which contains a non-zero constant function. Then A = C(X, C) if and only if

f ∈ A implies the conjugate function f ∈ A and A separates points of X .

Proof.

From Proposition 12.2.3, if A = C(X, C), A must separate points of X

and obviously f ∈ A = C(X, C) implies the conjugate function f ∈ A.
So we consider the converse statement. Define B to be the real-valued functions
in A. Clearly B is a closed subalgebra of C(X, R). We claim that it suffices to prove
that B = C(X, R). This is so, since if f ∈ C(X, C), then R(f ) and I(f ) are in

C(X, R) and so in B = C(X, R), and so A would be C(X, C).
We shall use the Real Stone-Weierstrass Theorem 12.2.20 to prove that B =

C(X, R). Let f ∈ C(X, C) seprate points of X . Then either R(f ) or I(f ) (or both)
separate points of X ; so B separates points of X . Now A contains a non-constant
function g . As A is an algebra, the conjugate function g is also in A. So the
non-constant real-valued function gg = |g|2 ∈ B . So by the Real Stone-Weierstrass
Theorem 12.2.20, B = C(X, R), which completes the proof.


7.2.23

Remark.

The Weierstrass Approximation Theorem 12.1.5 is of course

a special case of The (Complex) Stone-Weierstrass Theorem 12.2.22. It is the case

X = [a, b] ⊂ R and A is the set of all polynomials.

Remark.

We mentioned at the beginning

of §12.1 that in 1885 Karl Weierstrass was aged 70,
when he proved the The Weierstrass Approximation
Theorem 12.1.5. In contrast, in 1899 the Hungarian
Jewish mathematician Lipót Fejér (1880–1959), aged
19, proved the trignometric polynomial version of this
theorem from which The Weierstrass Approximation
Theorem 12.1.5 can be derived. Lipót Fejér was born
Lipót Weiss and changed his name in high school as he

Fejér

expected less antisemitism. Research students that he
supervized included: Marcel Riesz, George Pólya, Gábor Szegő, John von Neumann,
Pál Turán, and Paul Erdős - an incredible heritage.

Remark.

We observe that if f is a real trignometric polynomial or a

complex trignometric polynomial then

f (x) = f (x + 2π) = f (x + 2kπ), for all k ∈ N and x ∈ R.

(21)

We shall prove that every function f : R → R satisfying (21) can be approximated
by real trignometric polynomials and every function f : R → C satisfying (21) can
be approximated by complex trignometric polynomials.

Remark.
Let T denote the circle of diameter one centred at 0 in the
euclidean space R2 with the subspace topology from R2 . Of course T is a compact

12.2.29

Hausdorff space. Further, any function f : R → R or f : R → C which satisfies
(21) can be thought of as a function from T to R or from T to C. Further, f is a
continuous function if and only if the corresponding function from T to R or C is
continuous.

12.2.30

Corollary.

The algebra of all real trignometric polynomials is dense

in C(T, R) and the algebra of all complex trignometric polynomials is dense in
C(T, C).

Proof.

These results follow from The Real Stone-Weierstrass Theorem 12.2.20

and The Complex Stone-Weierstrass Theorem 12.2.22. [Exercise]

Remark.

Lord Kelvin4 (see Kelvin

[234]), was interested in correcting the magnetic
compass in ships, which usually had a lot of iron
and steel, in order to get a true north reading and
was also interested in predicting tides. Both of these
problems were able to be addressed using trignometric
polynomial approximation. For a discussion see Sury

Kelvin

[387].
We conclude this section with an interesting remark, unrelated to the StoneWeierstrass Theorem, on the spaces C(X, R).
12.2.31

Remark.

While C([0, 1], R) is just one separable Banach space, the

following result says it is much richer than you may have thought. Indeed it is a
universal separable metric space, as described below.
Banach Mazur Theorem.

Every separable Banach space is isometrically

embeddable as a metric space in C[(0, 1), R).
From the Banach-Alaoglu Theorem, Exercises 10.3 #33 (vii) and the Hahn-Banach
Theorem5 the following beautiful generalization can be deduced.
If B is any Banach space, then there exists a compact Hausdorff space X
such that B is isometrically embeddable as a metric space in C(X, R).
(See Maddox [271], Theorem 27.)
As a generalization of the concept of separability of a topological space, we introduce
the following notion. The density character of a topological space X is the least
cardinal number of a dense subspace of X . In 1969 Kleiber and Pervin [239] proved
the next theorem:
The topological space C([0, 1]ℵ , R) with the uniform topology is a universal
metric space of density character ℵ; that is, C([0, 1]ℵ , R) has density
character ℵ and every metric space of density character ℵ is isometrically
embedded as a subspace of C([0, 1]ℵ , R).
4 William Thompson (1824-1907), born in Belfast, Ireland, was the son of the Professor of
Mathematics at Glasgow University. He attended university classes from the age of 10. He graduated
from Camridge University and at the age of 22 returned to Glasgow University to become Professor
of Natural Sciences, a position he held for over half a century. He became a Lord in 1892, and took
the name Kelvin.

there is a map ∗ : A → A which satisfies (i)–(v).

we define f ∗ : X → C by f ∗ (x) = f (x), for every x ∈ X , where f (x) denotes
the complex conjugate of the complex number f (x).
Let A and B be C∗ -algebras.

Then A is said to be isomorphic as a C∗ -

algebra to B if there is a surjective one-to-one mapping φ : A → B such
that φ(x + y) = φ(x) + φ(y), φ(αx) = αφ(x), φ(x · y) = φ(x) · φ(y), and
φ(x∗ ) = (φ(x))∗ , for all x, y ∈ A and α ∈ C. The Gelfand-Naimark
Representation Theorem, proved using the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, says
every commutative unital C∗ -algebra A is isomorphic as a C∗ -algebra to

C(X, C), for some compact Hausdorff space X .
More generally, every commutative C∗ -algebra A is isomorphic as a C∗ algebra to C0 (X, C), for some locally compact Hausdorff space X . (See
Lang [252], Chapter 16, Theorem 3.3.)
It is also worth mentioning that C(X, C) is isomorphic as a C∗ -algebra to

C(Y, C), for compact Hausdorff spaces X and Y , if and only if X is homeomorphic
to Y . (See Lin [261], Theorem 1.3.9.)
The concept of a C∗ -algebra has its roots in the work on quantum mechanics of Werner Karl
Heisenberg (1901–1976), Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger (1887-1961), and John von
Neumann (1903–1957) in the 1920s. (See Landsman [251].)

Introduction

“The Infinite! No other question has ever moved so profoundly the spirit of
man.” - David Hilbert (1921)

Once upon a time in a far-off land there were two hotels, the Hotel Finite (an
ordinary hotel with a finite number of rooms) and Hilbert’s Hotel Infinite (an extraordinary hotel with an infinite number of rooms numbered 1, 2, . . . n, . . . ). One day
a visitor arrived in town seeking a room. She went first to the Hotel Finite and was
informed that all rooms were occupied and so she could not be accommodated, but
she was told that the other hotel, Hilbert’s Hotel Infinite, can always find an extra
room. So she went to Hilbert’s Hotel Infinite and was told that there too all rooms
were occupied. However, the desk clerk said at this hotel an extra guest can always
be accommodated without evicting anyone. He moved the guest from room 1 to
room 2, the guest from room 2 to room 3, and so on. Room 1 then became vacant!
From this cute example we see that there is an intrinsic difference between
infinite sets and finite sets. The aim of this Appendix is to provide a gentle but very
brief introduction to the theory of Infinite Sets8 . This is a fascinating topic which,
if you have not studied it before, will contain several surprises. We shall learn that
“infinite sets were not created equal" - some are bigger than others. At first pass it
is not at all clear what this statement could possibly mean. We will need to define
the term “bigger". Indeed we will need to define what we mean by “two sets are
the same size".

A1.1

Countable Sets

A1.1.1

Definitions.

Let A and B be sets. Then A is said to be equipotent

to B , denoted by A ∼ B , if there exists a function f : A → B which is both oneto-one and onto (that is, f is a bijection or a one-to-one correspondence).

A1.1.2

Proposition.

Let A, B , and C be sets.

(i) Then A ∼ A.
(ii) If A ∼ B then B ∼ A.
(iii) If A ∼ B and B ∼ C then A ∼ C .

Outline Proof.
(i) The identity function f on A, given by f (x) = x, for all x ∈ A, is a one-to-one
correspondence between A and itself.
(ii) If f is a bijection of A onto B then it has an inverse function g from B to A
and g is also a one-to-one correspondence.
(iii) If f : A → B is a one-to-one correspondence and g : B → C is a one-toone correspondence, then their composition gf : A → C is also a one-to-one
correspondence.
Proposition A1.1.2 says that the relation “∼” is reflexive (i), symmetric (ii), and
transitive (iii); that is, “∼” is an equivalence relation.

A1.1.3

Proposition.

Let n, m ∈ N.

Then the sets {1, 2, . . . , n} and

{1, 2, . . . , m} are equipotent if and only if n = m.

Proof.

Exercise.

Now we explicitly define the terms “finite set” and “infinite set”.



APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS

A1.1.4

Definitions.

Let S be a set.

(i) Then S is said to be finite if it is the empty set, Ø, or it is equipotent to

{1, 2, . . . , n}, for some n ∈ N.
(ii) If S is not finite, then it is said to be infinite.
(iii) If S ∼ {1, 2, . . . , n} then S is said to have cardinality n, which is denoted
by card S = n.
(iv) If S = Ø then the cardinality is said to be 0, which is denoted by card Ø = 0.

The next step is to define the “smallest” kind of infinite set. Such sets will be
called countably infinite. At this stage we do not know that there is any “bigger”
kind of infinite set – indeed we do not even know what “bigger” would mean in this
context.

A1.1.5

Definitions.

Let S be a set.

(i) The set S is said to be countably infinite (or denumerable) if it is
equipotent to N.
(ii) The set S is said to be countable if it is finite or countably infinite.
(iii) If S is countably infinite then it is said to have cardinality ℵ0 , denoted by
card S = ℵ0 .
(iv) A set S is said to be uncountable if it is not countable.

A1.1.6

Remark.

If the set S is countably infinite, then S = {s1 , s2 , . . . , sn , . . . }

where f : N → S is a one-to-one correspondence and sn = f (n), for all n ∈ N. So
we can list the elements of S . Of course if S is finite and non-empty, we can also list
its elements by S = {s1 , s2 , . . . , sn }. So we can list the elements of any countable
set. Conversely, if the elements of S can be listed, then S is countable as the
listing defines a one-to-one correspondence with N or {1, 2, . . . , n}.

395

The set S of all even positive integers is countably infinite.

A1.1.7

Example.

Proof.

The function f : N → S given by f (n) = 2 n, for all n ∈ N, is a one-to-one

correspondence.
Example A1.1.7 is worthy of a little contemplation. We think of two sets being
in one-to-one correspondence if they are “the same size”. But here we have the
set N in one-to-one correspondence with one of its proper subsets. This does not
happen with finite sets. Indeed finite sets can be characterized as those sets which
are not equipotent to any of their proper subsets.
A1.1.8

Example.

The set Z of all integers is countably infinite.

Proof.

The function f : N → Z given by


 m,
f (n) = −m,

0,

if n = 2m, m ⩾ 1
if n = 2m + 1, m ⩾ 1
if n = 1.

is a one-to-one correspondence.

Example.

The set S of all positive integers which are perfect squares

is countably infinite.
The function f : N → S given by f (n) = n2 is a one-to-one

Example A1.1.9 was proved about 1600 by the Italian
astronomer, engineer, and physicist Galileo Galilei (1564–1642).
It troubled him and suggested to him that the infinite is not

modern physics", the "father of the scientific method", and the
"father of modern science”.

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS

A1.1.11

Proposition.

If S is a countable set and T ⊂ S then T is

countable.

Proof.

Since S is countable we can write it as a list S = {s1 , s2 , . . .} (a finite list

if S is finite, an infinite one if S is countably infinite).
Let t1 be the first si in T (if T 6= Ø). Let t2 be the second si in T (if T 6= {t1 }).
Let t3 be the third si in T (if T 6= {t1 , t2 }), . . . .
This process comes to an end only if T = {t1 , t2 , . . . , tn } for some n, in
which case T is finite. If the process does not come to an end we obtain a list

{t1 , t2 , . . . , tn , . . .} of members of T . This list contains every member of T , because
if si ∈ T then we reach si no later than the i step in the process; so si occurs in
the list. Hence T is countably infinite. So T is either finite or countably infinite.
th

As an immediate consequence of Proposition A1.1.11 and Example A1.1.8 we
have the following result.
A1.1.12

Corollary.

Every subset of Z is countable.

If S1 , S2 , . . . , Sn , . . . is a countably infinite family of
∞
S
countably infinite sets such that Si ∩ Sj = Ø for i 6= j , then
Si is a countably

infinite set.
A1.1.13

Proof.

Lemma.

As each Si is a countably infinite set, Si = {si1 , si2 , . . . , sin , . . .}. Now

put the sij in a square array and list them by zigzagging up and down the short
diagonals.

This shows that all members of i=1 Si are listed, and the list is infinite because

each Si is infinite. So ∞
i=1 Si is countably infinite.

In Lemma A1.1.13 we assumed that the sets Si were pairwise disjoint. If they
are not pairwise disjoint the proof is easily modified by deleting repeated elements
to obtain:
If S1 , S2 , . . . , Sn , . . . is a countably infinite family of

Si is a countably infinite set.

The union of any countable family of countable sets

is countable.

A1.1.16

If S and T are countably infinite sets then the

Proposition.

product set S × T = {hs, ti : s ∈ S, t ∈ T } is a countably infinite set.

Proof.

Let S = {s1 , s2 , . . . , sn , . . . } and T = {t1 , t2 , . . . , tn , . . . }. Then

S×T =

{hsi , t1 i, hsi , t2 i, . . . , hsi , tn i, . . . }.

So S × T is a countably infinite union of countably infinite sets and is therefore
countably infinite.
A1.1.17

Corollary.

Every finite product of countable sets is countable.

We are now ready for a significant application of our observations on countable
sets.
A1.1.18

Lemma.

The set, Q>0 , of all positive rational numbers is

countably infinite.
Let Si be the set of all positive rational numbers (see Niven [317]) with

Proof.

398

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS

We are now ready to prove that the set, Q, of all rational numbers is countably
infinite; that is, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set Q and
the (seemingly) very much smaller set, N, of all positive integers.
A1.1.19

Theorem.

The set Q of all rational numbers is countably infinite.

Proof.
Clearly the set Q<0 of all negative rational numbers is equipotent to the
set, Q>0 , of all positive rational numbers and so using Proposition A1.1.10 and
Lemma A1.1.18 we obtain that Q<0 is countably infinite.
Finally observe that Q is the union of the three sets Q>0 , Q<0 and {0} and so
it too is countably infinite by Proposition A1.1.15.

A1.1.20

Proof.

Corollary.

Every set of rational numbers is countable.

This is a consequence of Theorem A1.1.19 and Proposition A1.1.11.

A1.1.21

Definitions.

A real number x is said to be an algebraic number

if there is a natural number n and integers a0 , a1 , . . . , an with a0 6= 0 such that

a0 xn + a1 xn−1 + · · · + an−1 x + an = 0.
A real number which is not an algebraic number is said to be a transcendental
number.

A1.1.22

Example.

Every rational number is an algebraic number.

Proof.

p
If x = q , for p, q ∈ Z and q 6= 0, then qx − p = 0; that is, x is an algebraic

number with n = 1, a0 = q , and an = −p.

√
A1.1.23

Example.

The number

2 is an algebraic number which is not a

rational number.
Proof.

While x =

2 is irrational, it satisfies x2 − 2 = 0 and so is algebraic.

Remark.
It is also easily verified that 5 − 3 is an algebraic number
since it satisfies x8 − 12x6 + 44x4 − 288x2 + 16 = 0. Indeed any real number

the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and the extraction of
square roots, cube roots, . . . , is algebraic.
A1.1.25

Remark.

are algebraic numbers.

Remark A1.1.24 shows that “most” numbers we think of
To show that a given number is transcendental can be

extremely difficult. The first such demonstration was in 1844 when Liouville proved
the transcendence of the number

It was Charles Hermite who, in 1873, showed that e is transcendental. In 1882
Lindemann proved that the number π is transcendental thereby answering in the
negative the 2,000 year old question about squaring the circle. (The question is:
given a circle of radius 1, is it possible, using only a straight edge and compass, to
construct a square with the same area? A full exposition of this problem and proofs
that e and π are transcendental are to be found in the book, Jones, Morris, and
Pearson [221].)
We now proceed to prove that the set A of all algebraic numbers is also countably
infinite. This is a more powerful result than Theorem A1.1.19 which is in fact a
corollary of this result.

400

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS

A1.1.26

Theorem.

The set A of all algebraic numbers is countably

infinite.

Proof.

Consider the polynomial f (x) = a0 xn + a1 xn−1 + · · · + an−1 x + an , where

a0 6= 0 and each ai ∈ Z and define its height to be k = n + |a0 | + |a1 | + · · · + |an |.
For each positive integer k , let Ak be the set of all roots of all such polynomials
∞
S
of height k . Clearly A =
Ak .
k=1
Therefore, to show that A is countably infinite, it suffices by Proposition A1.1.15
to show that each Ak is finite.
If f is a polynomial of degree n, then clearly n ⩽ k and |ai | ⩽ k , for
i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n. So the set of all polynomials of height k is certainly finite.
Further, a polynomial of degree n has at most n roots.

Consequently each

polynomial of height k has no more than k roots. Hence the set Ak is finite, as
required.

A1.1.27

Corollary.

Every set of algebraic numbers is countable.

Note that Corollary A1.1.27 has as a special case, Corollary A1.1.20.
So far we have not produced any example of an uncountable set. Before doing so
we observe that certain mappings will not take us out of the collection of countable
sets.

A1.1.28

Proposition. Let X and Y be sets and f a map of X into Y .

(i) If X is countable and f is surjective (that is, an onto mapping), then Y is
countable.
(ii) If Y is countable and f is injective (that is, a one-to-one mapping), then X
is countable.

Proof.

Exercise.

401

A1.1.29

Proposition.

Let S be a countable set. Then the set of all finite

subsets of S is also countable.

Proof.

Exercise.

A1.1.30

Definition.

Let S be any set. The set of all subsets of S is said

to be the power set of S and is denoted by P(S).

A1.1.31

Theorem. (Georg Cantor)

For every set S , the power set, P(S),

is not equipotent to S ; that is, P(S) 6∼ S .

Proof.

We have to prove that there is no one-to-one correspondence between

S and P(S). We shall prove more: that there is not even any surjective function
mapping S onto P(S).
Suppose that there exists a function f : S → P(S) which is onto. For each

x ∈ S , f (x) ∈ P(S), which is the same as saying that f (x) ⊆ S .
Let T = {x : x ∈ S and x 6∈ f (x)}. Then T ⊆ S ; that is, T ∈ P(S). So

T = f (y) for some y ∈ S , since f maps S onto P(S). Now y ∈ T or y 6∈ T .
Case 1.

y ∈ T ⇒ y 6∈ f (y)
⇒ y 6∈ T

(by the definition of T )

(since f (y) = T ).

So Case 1 is impossible.

Case 2.

y 6∈ T ⇒ y ∈ f (y)
⇒y∈T

(by the definition of T)

(since f (y) = T ).

So Case 2 is impossible.
As both cases are impossible, we have a contradiction. So our supposition is
false and there does not exist any function mapping S onto P(S). Thus P(S) is
not equipotent to S .

402

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS

A1.1.32

Lemma.

If S is any set, then S is equipotent to a subset of its

power set, P(S).

Proof.

Define the mapping f : S → P(S) by f (x) = {x}, for each x ∈ S . Clearly

f is a one-to-one correspondence between the sets S and f (S). So S is equipotent
to the subset f (S) of P(S).

A1.1.33

Proposition.

If S is any infinite set, then P(S) is an uncountable

set.

Proof.

As S is infinite, the set P(S) is infinite. By Theorem A1.1.31, P(S) is

not equipotent to S .
Suppose P(S) is countably infinite.

Then by Proposition A1.1.11, Lemma

A1.1.32 and Proposition A1.1.10, S is countably infinite.

So S and P(S) are

equipotent, which is a contradiction. Hence P(S) is uncountable.
Proposition A1.1.33 demonstrates the existence of uncountable sets. However
the sceptic may feel that the example is contrived. So we conclude this section by
observing that important and familiar sets are uncountable.

403

A1.1.34

Lemma.

The set of all real numbers in the half open interval

[1, 2) is not countable.

Proof.

(Cantor’s diagonal argument)

We shall show that the set of all real

numbers in [1, 2) cannot be listed.
Let L = {r1 , r2 , . . . rn . . . } be any list of real numbers each of which lies in the
set [1, 2). Write down their decimal expansions:

r1 =1.r11 r12 . . . r1n . . .
r2 =1.r21 r22 . . . r2n . . .
..
.

rm =1.rm1 rm2 . . . rmn . . .

.
Consider the real number a defined to be 1.a1 a2 . . . an . . . where, for each n ∈ N,


1
an =
2

if rnn 6= 1
if rnn = 1.

Clearly an 6= rnn and so a 6= rn , for all n ∈ N. Thus a does not appear anywhere
in the list L. Thus there does not exist a listing of the set of all real numbers in

[1, 2); that is, this set is uncountable.
A1.1.35

Proof.

Theorem. The set, R, of all real numbers is uncountable.

Suppose R is countable. Then by Proposition A1.1.11 the set of all real

numbers in [1, 2) is countable, which contradicts Lemma A1.1.34. Therefore R is
uncountable.

404

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS

A1.1.36

Proof.

Corollary.

The set, I, of all irrational numbers is uncountable.

Suppose I is countable. Then R is the union of two countable sets: I

and Q. By Proposition A1.1.15, R is countable which is a contradiction. Hence I is
uncountable.
Using a similar proof to that in Corollary A1.1.36 we obtain the following result.

A1.1.37

A1.2

Corollary.

The set of all transcendental numbers is uncountable.

Cardinal Numbers

In the previous section we defined countably infinite and uncountable and suggested,
without explaining what it might mean, that uncountable sets are “bigger” than
countably infinite sets. To explain what we mean by “bigger” we will need the next
theorem.
Our exposition is based on that in the book, Halmos [168]

405

A1.2.1

Theorem. (Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein)

Let S and T be sets. If

S is equipotent to a subset of T and T is equipotent to a subset of S , then S
is equipotent to T .
Proof.

Without loss of generality we can assume S and T are disjoint.

Let

f : S → T and g : T → S be one-to-one maps. We are required to find a bijection
of S onto T .
We say that an element s is a parent of an element f (s) and f (s) is a
descendant of s. Also t is a parent of g(t) and g(t) is a descendant of t. Each

s ∈ S has an infinite sequence of descendants: f (s), g(f (s)), f (g(f (s))), and so
on. We say that each term in such a sequence is an ancestor of all the terms that
follow it in the sequence.
Now let s ∈ S . If we trace its ancestry back as far as possible one of three
things must happen:
(i) the list of ancestors is finite, and stops at an element of S which has no ancestor;
(ii) the list of ancestors is finite, and stops at an element of T which has no ancestor;
(iii) the list of ancestors is infinite.
Let SS be the set of those elements in S which originate in S ; that is, SS is the
set S \ g(T ) plus all of its descendants in S . Let ST be the set of those elements
which originate in T ; that is, ST is the set of descendants in S of T \ f (S). Let S∞
be the set of all elements in S with no parentless ancestors. Then S is the union of
the three disjoint sets SS , ST and S∞ . Similarly T is the disjoint union of the three
similarly defined sets: TT , TS , and T∞ .
Clearly the restriction of f to SS is a bijection of SS onto TS .
Now let g −1 be the inverse function of the bijection g of T onto g(T ). Clearly
the restriction of g −1 to ST is a bijection of ST onto TT .
Finally, the restriction of f to S∞ is a bijection of S∞ onto T∞ .
Define h : S → T by


 f (s)
h(s) = g −1 (s)

f (s)

if s ∈ SS
if s ∈ ST
if s ∈ S∞ .

Then h is a bijection of S onto T . So S is equipotent to T .

406

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS

Our next task is to define what we mean by “cardinal number”.

A1.2.2

Definitions.

A collection, ℵ, of sets is said to be a cardinal

number if it satisfies the conditions:
(i) Let S and T be sets. If S and T are in ℵ, then S ∼ T ;
(ii) Let A and B be sets. If A is in ℵ and B ∼ A, then B is in ℵ.
If ℵ is a cardinal number and A is a set in ℵ, then we write card A = ℵ.

Definitions A1.2.2 may, at first sight, seem strange. A cardinal number is defined
as a collection of sets. So let us look at a couple of special cases:
If a set A has two elements we write card A = 2; the cardinal number 2 is the
collection of all sets equipotent to the set {1, 2}, that is the collection of all sets
with 2 elements.
If a set S is countable infinite, then we write card S = ℵ0 ; in this case the
cardinal number ℵ0 is the collection of all sets equipotent to N.
Let S and T be sets. Then S is equipotent to T if and only if card S = card T .

A1.2.3

Definitions.

The cardinality of R is denoted by c; that is, card R =

c. The cardinality of N is denoted by ℵ0 .
The symbol c is used in Definitions A1.2.3 as we think of R as the “continuum”.
We now define an ordering of the cardinal numbers.

A1.2.4

Definitions.

Let m and n be cardinal numbers. Then the cardinal

m is said to be less than or equal to n, that is m ⩽ n, if there are sets S and
T such that card S = m, card T = n, and S is equipotent to a subset of T .
Further, the cardinal m is said to be strictly less than n, that is m < n, if
m ⩽ n and m 6= n.
As R has N as a subset, card R = c and card N = ℵ0 , and R is not equipotent
to N, we immediately deduce the following result.

407

A1.2.5

ℵ0 < c.

Proposition.

We also know that for any set S , S is equipotent to a subset of P(S), and S is
not equipotent to P(S), from which we deduce the next result.

A1.2.6

For any set S , card S < card P(S).

Theorem.

The following is a restatement of the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein Theorem 1.2.1.

A1.2.7

Let m and n be cardinal numbers. If m ⩽ n and n ⩽ m,

Theorem.

then m = n.

A1.2.8

Remark.

We observe that there are an infinite number of infinite

cardinal numbers. This is clear from the fact that:

ℵ0 = card N < card P(N) < card P(P(N)) < . . .

(∗)

The next result is an immediate consequence of Theorem A1.2.6.

A1.2.9

Corollary.

There is no largest cardinal number.

Noting that if a finite set S has n elements, then its power set P(S) has 2n
elements, it is natural to introduce the following notation.

A1.2.10

Definition.
P(S) is denoted by 2ℵ .

If a set S has cardinality ℵ, then the cardinality of

Thus we can rewrite (∗) above as:

(∗∗)

ℵ0

ℵ0 < 2ℵ0 < 22

2ℵ0

< 22

When we look at this sequence of cardinal numbers there are a number of
questions which should come to mind including:

408

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS

(1) Is c equal to one of the cardinal numbers on this list?
(2) Are there any cardinal numbers strictly between ℵ0 and 2ℵ0 ?
These questions, especially (2), are not easily answered. Indeed they require
a careful look at the axioms of set theory. It is not possible in this Appendix to
discuss seriously the axioms of set theory.

Nevertheless we will touch upon the

above questions later in the appendix.
We conclude this section by identifying the cardinalities of a few more familiar
sets.

A1.2.11

Lemma.

Let a and b be real numbers with a < b. Then

(i) [0, 1] ∼ [a, b];
(ii) (0, 1) ∼ (a, b);
(iii) (0, 1) ∼ (1, ∞);
(iv) (−∞, −1) ∼ (−2, −1);
(v) (1, ∞) ∼ (1, 2);
(vi) R ∼ (−2, 2);
(vii) R ∼ (a, b).

Outline Proof.

(i) is proved by observing that f (x) = a + (b − a)x defines a

one-to-one function of [0, 1] onto [a, b]. (ii) and (iii) are similarly proved by finding
suitable functions. (iv) is proved using (iii) and (ii). (v) follows from (iv). (vi)
follows from (iv) and (v) by observing that R is the union of the pairwise disjoint
sets (−∞, −1), [−1, 1] and (1, ∞). (vii) follows from (vi) and (ii).

A1.2.12

Let a and b be real numbers with a < b.

Proposition.

is any subset of R such that (a, b) ⊆ S , then card S = c.

If S

In particular,

card (a, b) = card [a, b] = c.

Proof.

Using Lemma A1.2.11 observe that
card R = card (a, b) ⩽ card [a, b] ⩽ card R.

So card (a, b) = card [a, b] = card R = c.

A1.2.13

Proposition.
then card (R2 ) = c.

Outline Proof.

.

If R2 is the set of points in the Euclidean plane,

By Proposition A1.2.12, R is equipotent to the half-open interval

[0, 1) and it is easily shown that it suffices to prove that [0, 1) × [0, 1) ∼ [0, 1).
Define f : [0, 1) → [0, 1) × [0, 1) by f (x) is the point hx, 0i. Then f is a one-toone mapping of [0, 1) into [0, 1) × [0, 1) and so c = card [0, 1) ⩽ card [0, 1) × [0, 1).
By the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein Theorem A.2.1, it suffices then to find a
one-to-one function g of [0, 1) × [0, 1) into [0, 1). Define

g(h0.a1 a2 . . . an . . . , 0.b1 b2 . . . bn . . . , i) = 0.a1 b1 a2 b2 . . . an bn . . . .
Clearly g is well-defined (as each real number in [0, 1) has a unique decimal
representation that does not end in 99. . . 9. . . ) and is one-to-one, which completes
the proof.

A1.3

Cardinal Arithmetic

We begin with a definition of addition of cardinal numbers. Of course, when the
cardinal numbers are finite, this definition must agree with addition of finite numbers.

A1.3.1

Definition.

Let α and β be any cardinal numbers and select disjoint

sets A and B such that card A = α and card B = β . Then the sum of the
cardinal numbers α and β is denoted by α + β and is equal to card (A ∪ B).

410

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS

A1.3.2

Remark.

Before knowing that the above definition makes sense and

in particular does not depend on the choice of the sets A and B , it is necessary
to verify that if A1 and B1 are disjoint sets and A and B are disjoint sets such
that card A = card A1 and card B = card B1 , then A ∪ B ∼ A1 ∪ B1 ; that is,
card (A ∪ B) = card (A1 ∪ B1 ). This is a straightforward task and so is left as an
exercise.
A1.3.3

Proposition.

For any cardinal numbers α, β and γ :

(i) α + β = β + α ;
(ii) α + (β + γ) = (α + β) + γ ;
(iii) α + 0 = α ;
(iv) If α ⩽ β then α + γ ⩽ β + γ .

Proof.
A1.3.4

Exercise
Proposition.

(i) ℵ0 + ℵ0 = ℵ0 ;
(ii) c + ℵ0 = c;
(iii) c + c = c;
(iv) For any finite cardinal n, n + ℵ0 = ℵ0 and n + c = c.

Proof.
(i) The listing 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , n, −n, . . . shows that the union of the two countably
infinite sets N and the set of negative integers is a countably infinite set.
(ii) Noting that [−2, −1] ∪ N ⊂ R, we see that card [−2, −1] + card N ⩽ card R = c.
So c = card [−2, −1] ⩽ card ([−2, −1]∪N) = card [−2, −1]+ card N = c+ℵ0 ⩽ c.
(iii) Note that c ⩽ c + c = card ((0, 1) ∪ (1, 2)) ⩽ card R = c from which the required
result is immediate.
(iv) Observe that ℵ0 ⩽ n + ℵ0 ⩽ ℵ0 + ℵ0 = ℵ0 and c ⩽ n + c ⩽ c + c = c, from which
the results follow.
Next we define multiplication of cardinal numbers.

411

A1.3.5

Definition.

Let α and β be any cardinal numbers and select disjoint

sets A and B such that card A = α and card B = β . Then the product of the
cardinal numbers α and β is denoted by αβ and is equal to card (A × B).

As in the case of addition of cardinal numbers, it is necessary, but routine, to
check in Definition A1.3.5 that α β does not depend on the specific choice of the
sets A and B .

A1.3.6

Proposition.

For any cardinal numbers α, β and γ

(i) αβ = βα ;
(ii) α(βγ) = (αβ)γ ;
(iii) 1.α = α ;
(iv) 0.α = 0;
(v) α(β + γ) = αβ + αγ ;
(vi) For any finite cardinal n, nα = α + α + . . . α (n-terms);
(vii) If α ⩽ β then αγ ⩽ βγ .

Proof.

A1.3.7

Exercise

Proposition.

(i) ℵ0 ℵ0 = ℵ0 ;
(ii) c c = c;
(iii) c ℵ0 = c;
(iv) For any finite cardinal n, n ℵ0 = ℵ0 and n c = c.

Outline Proof.

(i) follows from Proposition A1.1.16, while (ii) follows from

Proposition A1.2.13. To see (iii), observe that c = c.1 ⩽ c ℵ0 ⩽ c c = c. The
proof of (iv) is also straightforward.

412

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS

The next step in the arithmetic of cardinal numbers is to define exponentiation
of cardinal numbers; that is, if α and β are cardinal numbers then we wish to define
α β.

A1.3.8

Definitions.

Let α and β be cardinal numbers and A and B sets

such that card A = α and card B = β . The set of all functions f of B into A
is denoted by AB . Further, α β is defined to be card AB .

Once again we need to check that the definition makes sense, that is that αβ
does not depend on the choice of the sets A and B . We also check that if n and

m are finite cardinal numbers, A is a set with n elements and B is a set with m
elements, then there are precisely nm distinct functions from B into A.
We also need to address one more concern: If α is a cardinal number and A is a
set such that card A = α, then we have two different definitions of 2α . The above
definition has 2α as the cardinality of the set of all functions of A into the two point
set {0, 1}. On the other hand, Definition A1.2.10 defines 2α to be card (P(A)).
It suffices to find a bijection θ of {0, 1}A onto P(A). Let f ∈ {0, 1}A . Then
f : A → {0, 1}. Define θ(f ) = f −1 (1). The task of verifying that θ is a bijection is
left as an exercise.

A1.3.9

Proposition.

For any cardinal numbers α, β and γ :

(i) α β+γ = αβ αγ ;
(ii) (αβ)γ = αγ β γ ;
γ
(iii) (αβ ) = α(βγ) ;
(iv) α ⩽ β implies αγ ⩽ β γ ;
(v) α ⩽ β implies γ α ⩽ γ β .

Proof.

Exercise

After Definition A1.2.10 we asked three questions. We are now in a position to
answer the second of these questions.

413

A1.3.10

Lemma.

ℵ0 ℵ 0 = c .

Observe that card NN = ℵ0 ℵ0 and card (0, 1) = c. As the function
f : (0, 1) → NN given by f (0.a1 a2 . . . an . . . ) = ha1 , a2 , . . . , an , . . . i is an injection, it
follows that c ⩽ ℵ0 ℵ0 .

Proof.

By the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein Theorem A1.2.1, to conclude the proof it
suffices to find an injective map g of NN into (0, 1). If ha1 , a2 , . . . , an , . . . i is any
element of NN , then each ai ∈ N and so we can write

ai = . . . ain ai(n−1) . . . ai2 ai1 , where for some Mi ∈ N, ain = 0, for all n > Mi
[For example 187 = . . . 0 0 . . . 0 1 8 7 and so if ai = 187 then ai1 = 7, ai2 = 8, ai3 =1
and ain = 0, for n > Mi = 3.] Then define the map g by
g(ha1 , a2 , . . . , an , . . . i) = 0.a11 a12 a21 a13 a22 a31 a14 a23 a32 a41 a15 a24 a33 a42 a51 a16 . . . .
(Compare this with the proof of Lemma A1.1.13.)
Clearly g is an injection, which completes the proof.

414

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS

We now state a beautiful result, first proved by Georg Cantor.

A1.3.11

Theorem.

2ℵ0 = c.

Firstly observe that 2ℵ0 ⩽ ℵ0 ℵ0 = c, by Lemma A1.3.10. So we
have to verify that c ⩽ 2ℵ0 . To do this it suffices to find an injective map f of
Proof.

the set [0, 1) into {0, 1}N .

Each element x of [0, 1) has a binary representation

x = 0.x1 x2 . . . xn . . . , with each xi equal to 0 or 1. The binary representation is
unique except for representations ending in a string of 1s; for example,

1/4 = 0.0100 . . . 0 · · · = 0.0011 . . . 1 . . . .
Providing that in all such cases we choose the representation with a string of zeros
rather than a string of 1s, the representation of numbers in [0, 1) is unique. We
define the function f : [0, 1) → {0, 1}N which maps x ∈ [0, 1) to the function

f (x) : N → {0, 1} given by f (x)(n) = xn , n ∈ N. To see that f is injective,
consider any x and y in [0, 1) with x 6= y . Then xm 6= ym , for some m ∈ N. So
f (x)(m) = xm 6= ym = f (y)(m). Hence the two functions f (x) : N → {0, 1} and
f (y) : N → {0, 1} are not equal. As x and y were arbitrary (unequal) elements of
[0, 1), it follows that f is indeed injective, as required.

415

A1.3.12
αℵ0 = c.

Corollary.

If α is a cardinal number such that 2 ⩽ α ⩽ c, then

Proof.

Observe that c = 2ℵ0 ⩽ αℵ0 ⩽ cℵ0 = (2ℵ0 )ℵ0 = 2ℵ0 ·ℵ0 = 2ℵ0 = c.

A1.4

Ordinal Numbers9

A1.4.1

Definitions.

A partially ordered set (X, ⩽) is said to be linearly

ordered (or totally ordered) if every two elements are comparable. The order

⩽ is then said to be a linear order (or a total order.) The linear ordering is
said to be a strict linear ordering (or a strict total ordering) if

a ⩽ b and b ⩽ a =⇒ a = b, for a, b ∈ X.

A1.4.2

Definitions.

A strict totally ordered set (S, ⩽) is said to be a

well-ordered set if every non-empty subset of S has a least element. The total
ordering is then said to be a well-ordering.

9

For more detailed expositions of ordinal numbers see Abian [2], Ciesielski [83], Kamke [224],
Roitman [344].

416

A1.4.3

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS

Remark.

Our next theorem says that every set can be well-ordered.

While we call this a Theorem, it is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice A6.1.26 and
to Zorn’s Lemma 10.2.16. Usually we start set theory with the Zermelo-Fraenkel
(ZF) Axioms. (See Remark A6.1.26 and view my 3 videos on the Zermelo-Fraenkel
Axioms:
Video 2a – http://youtu.be/9h83ZJeiecg,
Video 2b – http://youtu.be/QPSRB4Fhzko, &
Video 2c – http://youtu.be/YvqUnjjQ3TQ.)
In ZF, the Axiom of Choice cannot be proved.

So the Well-Ordering Theorem

A1.2.4 cannot be proved in ZF. If we assume any one of the Axiom of Choice,
Zorn’s Lemma, or the Well-Ordering Theorem is true, then the other two can be
proved. (For many equivalents of the Axiom of Choice, see Rubin and Rubin [348]
and Rubin and Rubin [349].) If we add the Axiom of Choice to the Zermelo-Fraenkel
Axioms, we get what is called ZFC. Many (but certainly not all) mathematicians
work entirely within ZFC.

A1.4.4

Theorem.

[Well-Ordering Theorem]

Let S be any non-empty

set. Then there exists a well-ordering ⩽ on S .

A1.4.5

Definitions.

The partially ordered sets (X, ⩽) and (Y, ) are said

to be order isomorphic (or have the same order type) if there is a bijection

f : X → Y such that for a, b ∈ X ,
a ⩽ b if and only if f (a)  f (b). The
function f is said to be an order isomorphism.

417

A1.4.6

Proposition.

Let (X, ⩽), (Y, ), and (Z, ) be partially ordered

sets.
(i) If f : X → Y is an order isomorphism, then the inverse function f ← : Y →

X is also an order isomorphism.
(ii) If f : X → Y and g : Y → Z are order isomorphisms, then g ◦ f : X → Z is
also an order isomorphism.
(iii) Let f : X → Y be an order isomorphism. If (X, ⩽) is totally ordered, then

(Y, ) is totally ordered.
(iv) Let f : X → Y be an order isomorphism. If (X, ⩽) is well-ordered, then

(Y, ) is well-ordered.

Proof.

Exercise.



A1.4.7

Remark.

We have indicated that we start with the ZF axioms of set

theory. Next we need to define the natural numbers. We shall use induction. We
begin by defining the number 0 as the empty set Ø. Then the number 1 = {0} =

{Ø}; the number 2 = {0, 1} = {Ø, {Ø}}. Now using mathematical induction, we
can define the number n to be {0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1}. Further, N = {1, 2, . . . , n, . . . }.
Thinking of the natural numbers as sets allows us to recognize that
(i) n is well-ordered by ⊆;
(ii) n ∈
/ n;
(iii) if m ∈ n, then m ∈
/ m;
(iv) if m ∈ n, then m ⊆ n.
(v) if m ∈ n and p ∈ m, then p ∈ n.
So with this in mind we see that each natural number n as well as N is a set with a
natural well-ordering.
This sets the stage for the definition of ordinal numbers first given by John
von Neumann (1903-1957) in his 1923 paper, von Neumann [409]. See also von
Neumann [410].

A1.4.8

A set α is said to be an ordinal number (or an ordinal)

Definition.

if it is the set of all ordinal numbers β < α well-ordered by ⊆.

A1.4.9

Proposition.

A set α is an ordinal number (or an ordinal) if and

only it has the following properties:
(i) α is well-ordered by ⊆;
(ii) α ∈

(iii) if β ∈ α, then β ∈

(iv) if β ∈ α, then β ⊆ α;
(v) if β ∈ α and γ ∈ β , then γ ∈ α.

Proof.

A1.4.10

Remark.



We see that each of the natural numbers n ∈ N, regarded

as a well-ordered set, is an ordinal number. Further, the definition of the set N of
all natural numbers satisfies Definition A1.4.8 and so is an ordinal number, which
will be denoted by ω .
A1.4.11

Remark.

The relation ⊆ on an ordinal number is usually denoted by

⩽. The relation < is then clearly the same as ∈.
We gather together in the next proposition several important results the proofs
of which are straightforward.

419

A1.4.12

Proposition.

(i) If α is an ordinal number and β ∈ α, then β is also an ordinal number;
(ii) for ordinal numbers α, β , if α is order isomorphic to β then α = β ;
(iii) for ordinal numbers α, β , (a) α = β or (b) α < β or (c) β < α;
(iv) if S is any non-empty set of ordinal numbers, then

S

Si ∈S Si is an ordinal

number;
(v) For every well-ordered set (S, ⩽), there exists exactly one ordinal number α
that is order isomorphic to (S, ⩽).
Proof.



Exercise.

Now we shall define the sum and product of two ordinals α and β . In case α
and β are not disjoint, for the sum we replace them by the equivalent sets ({0} × α)
and ({1} × β), then we define the ordering on the union of these two sets by keeping
the original ordering on α and on β and making every element of α less than every
element of β .

A1.4.13

Definitions.

if α and β are ordinal numbers, then their sum,

denoted by α + β is the order type of the well-ordered set

S = ({0} × α)

[
({1} × β)

(i, δ) ⩽ (j, γ) if and only if i < j or δ ⩽ γ.
The product, denoted by αβ is the order type of the well-ordered set α × β
ordered by

where the ordering is antilexicographic; that is,

(a, b) ⩽ (c, d) if and only if (i) b < d or (ii) b = d and a ⩽ c.
A1.4.14

Remark.

It is readily verified that addition and multiplication of

ordinal numbers is associative; that is, for ordinal numbers α, β , γ , we have

α + (β + γ) = (α + β) + γ and α(βγ) = (αβ)γ. However, neither addition nor
multiplication of ordinal numbers is commutative.

For example it is readily

proved that

3 + ω = ω 6= ω + 3

and

The following table should prove helpful.

ω2 = ω + ω 6= ω = 2ω.

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS

A1.4.24

Remark.

Now we turn to the notion of exponentiation of ordinal

numbers; that is, for ordinal numbers α and β we wish to define the ordinal number
αβ . This has to be done with considerable care in the case of infinite ordinals or
the resulting set will not be well-ordered and so will not be an ordinal number.
A1.4.25

Definition.

Let α and β be ordinal numbers. Let αβ be the set

of all functions from the set β to the set α such that only a finite number
of elements of the set β map to a non-zero member of the set α. Order the
functions lexicographically as follows:
if f, g ∈ αβ then there exists a finite set {c

1 < c2 < · · · < cn } ⊆ β such
that for b ∈ β , f (b) = 0 and g(b) = 0 for b ∈
/ {c1 , c2 , . . . , cn }, Let ci be the

smallest member of {c1 , c2 , . . . , cn } such that f (ci ) 6= g(ci ). Then define f < g
if f (ci ) < g(ci ), otherwise define g < f .

A1.4.26

Remark.

It needs to be checked that αβ as defined in Definition

A1.4.25 is indeed an ordinal number, and in particular is a well-ordered set. Without
the finiteness restriction in the definition, this would not be the case.
A1.4.27

Theorem.

[Transfinite Induction]

Let P (γ) be a proposition

which is defined for all ordinals γ . If P (0) is true and for each ordinal number

α, P (β) true for all β < α imples P (α) is true, then P is true for all ordinals.

(ii) ω < ω 2 < · · · < ω n , for any natural number n > 2;
(iii) ω ω = sup ω n ;
n∈ω
(iv) ω < ω n < ω ω , for any natural number n > 1.
ω
Each of the ordinals ω , ω ω . ω ω , . . . is a countable ordinal;
ω
that is, each of the sets ω , ω ω . ω ω , . . . is a countable set. Further, the ordinal

A1.4.30

Remark.

ω
number ε0 is defined to be sup{ω, ω ω , ω ω , . . . } and it too is a countable ordinal.
Clearly ω ε0 = ε0 . An ordinal number α which satisfies the equation ω α = α are said
to be an ε-number. The ordinal ε0 is the smallest epsilon number. The next ordinal
ε0 +1
satisfying this equation is denoted by ε1 and equals sup{ε0 + 1, ω ε0 +1 , ω ω
. . . }.
All the ε-numbers is also a countable ordinal.

Now we must of necessity be vague, because otherwise we would have to include
quite a lot of deep material. (See Pohlers [327].) We can continue defining ordinals
in a recursive way. The smallest ordinal which cannot be defined recursively in terms
of smaller ordinals is called the Church-Kleene ordinal denoted by ω1CK . It too is
a countable ordinal. The first uncountable ordinal is denoted ω1 .
A1.4.31

Remark.

How are cardinal numbers related to ordinal numbers? Every

cardinal number is indeed an ordinal number.If we define Z(α) to consist of all the
ordinal numbers Z(α) which are equipotent to the ordinal number α, we note that

Z(α) is indeed a subset of the power set of the set α and so is a set. Further it has
a smallest (or first) element, often called an initial ordinal. Each cardinal number
is the initial ordinal of some ordinal α. We see that each cardinal number is a limit
ordinal ordinal.
Having pointed out that ever cardinal number is an ordinal number, it is essential that
we observe that cardinal arithmetic is very different from ordinal arithmetic.
One need go no further than observing that the cardinal number ℵ0 is the ordinal
ℵ
number ω . However, ℵ0 0 is uncountable, while ω ω is countable. Ordinal addition and
multiplication are not commutative while cardinal addition and cardinal multiplication
are commutative.
We conclude this section by stating Cantor’s Normal Form for ordinals.

René-Louis Baire
René-Louis Baire was born in Paris, France in
1874.

In 1905 he was appointed to the Faculty

of Science at Dijon and in 1907 was promoted to
Professor of Analysis.

He retired in 1925 after

many years of illness, and died in 1932.

Reports

on his teaching vary, perhaps according to his health:
“Some described his lectures as very clear, but others
claimed that what he taught was so difficult that it
was beyond human ability to understand.”

Baire

Stefan Banach
Stefan Banach was born in Ostrowsko, AustriaHungary – now Poland – in 1892.
He lectured in mathematics at Lvov Technical
University

from

1920

where

he

completed

his

doctorate which is said to mark the birth of functional
analysis.

In his dissertation, written in 1920, he

defined axiomatically what today is called a Banach
space.

The name ’Banach space’ was coined by

Fréchet.

In 1924 Banach was promoted to full

Professor. As well as continuing to produce a stream
of important papers, he wrote textbooks in arithmetic,

Banach

geometry and algebra for high school. Banach’s Open
Mapping Theorem of 1929 uses set-theoretic concepts which were introduced by
Baire in his 1899 dissertation. The Banach-Tarski paradox appeared in a joint paper
of the two mathematicians (Banach and Alfred Tarski) in 1926 in Fundamenta
Mathematicae entitled Sur la décomposition des ensembles de points en partiens
respectivement congruent. The puzzling paradox shows that a ball can be divided
into subsets which can be fitted together to make two balls each identical to the
first. The Axiom of Choice is needed to define the decomposition and the fact that
it is able to give such a non-intuitive result has made some mathematicians question
the use of the Axiom. The Banach-Tarski paradox was a major contribution to the
work being done on axiomatic set theory around this period. In 1929, together with
Hugo Dyonizy Steinhaus, he started a new journal Studia Mathematica and Banach
and Steinhaus became the first editors. The editorial policy was . . . to focus on
research in functional analysis and related topics. The way that Banach worked was
unconventional. He liked to do mathematical research with his colleagues in the
cafés of Lvov. Stanislaw Ulam recalls frequent sessions in the Scottish Café (cf.
Mauldin [278]): “It was difficult to outlast or outdrink Banach during these sessions.
We discussed problems proposed right there, often with no solution evident even
after several hours of thinking.

The next day Banach was likely to appear with

several small sheets of paper containing outlines of proofs he had completed.” In

428

APPENDIX 2: TOPOLOGY PERSONALITIES

1939, just before the start of World War II, Banach was elected President of the
Polish Mathematical Society. The Nazi occupation of Lvov in June 1941 meant
that Banach lived under very difficult conditions. Towards the end of 1941 Banach
worked feeding lice in a German institute dealing with infectious diseases. Feeding
lice was to be his life during the remainder of the Nazi occupation of Lvov up to
July 1944. Banach died in 1945.

Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer
Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer was born in 1881 in
Rotterdam, The Netherlands. While an undergraduate
at the University of Amsterdam he proved original
results on continuous motions in four dimensional
space.

He obtained his Master’s degree in 1904.

Brouwer’s doctoral dissertation, published in 1907, made
a major contribution to the ongoing debate between
Bertrand Russell and Jules Henri Poincaré on the logical
foundations of mathematics. Brouwer quickly found that
his philosophical ideas sparked controversy. Brouwer put
a very large effort into studying various problems which
he attacked because they appeared on David Hilbert’s

Brouwer

list of problems proposed at the Paris International Congress of Mathematicians in
1900. In particular Brouwer attacked Hilbert’s fifth problem concerning the theory
of Lie groups. He addressed the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rome
in 1908 on the topological foundations of Lie groups.

Brouwer was elected to

the Royal Academy of Sciences in 1912 and, in the same year, was appointed
extraordinary Professor of set theory, function theory and axiomatics at the University
of Amsterdam; he would hold the post until he retired in 1951. Bartel Leendert van
der Waerden, who studied at Amsterdam from 1919 to 1923, wrote about Brouwer
as a lecturer: Brouwer came [to the university] to give his courses but lived in Laren.
He came only once a week. In general that would have not been permitted - he
should have lived in Amsterdam - but for him an exception was made. ... I once
interrupted him during a lecture to ask a question. Before the next week’s lesson,

429

his assistant came to me to say that Brouwer did not want questions put to him in
class. He just did not want them, he was always looking at the blackboard, never
towards the students. Even though his most important research contributions were
in topology, Brouwer never gave courses on topology, but always on – and only
on – the foundations of intuitionism. It seemed that he was no longer convinced
of his results in topology because they were not correct from the point of view
of intuitionism, and he judged everything he had done before, his greatest output,
false according to his philosophy. As is mentioned in this quotation, Brouwer was
a major contributor to the theory of topology and he is considered by many to be
its founder. He did almost all his work in topology early in his career between 1909
and 1913. He discovered characterisations of topological mappings of the Cartesian
plane and a number of fixed point theorems. His first fixed point theorem, which
showed that an orientation preserving continuous one-one mapping of the sphere
to itself always fixes at least one point, came out of his research on Hilbert’s fifth
problem. Originally proved for a 2-dimensional sphere, Brouwer later generalised
the result to spheres in n dimensions. Another result of exceptional importance was
proving the invariance of topological dimension.

As well as proving theorems of

major importance in topology, Brouwer also developed methods which have become
standard tools in the subject. In particular he used simplicial approximation, which
approximated continuous mappings by piecewise linear ones.

He also introduced

the idea of the degree of a mapping, generalised the Jordan curve theorem to
n-dimensional space, and defined topological spaces in 1913. Van der Waerden,
in the above quote, said that Brouwer would not lecture on his own topological
results since they did not fit with mathematical intuitionism. In fact Brouwer is best
known to many mathematicians as the founder of the doctrine of mathematical
intuitionism, which views mathematics as the formulation of mental constructions
that are governed by self-evident laws. His doctrine differed substantially from the
formalism of Hilbert and the logicism of Russell. His doctoral thesis in 1907 attacked
the logical foundations of mathematics and marks the beginning of the Intuitionist
School. In his 1908 paper The Unreliability of the Logical Principles Brouwer rejected
in mathematical proofs the Principle of the Excluded Middle, which states that any
mathematical statement is either true or false. In 1918 he published a set theory
developed without using the Principle of the Excluded Middle. He was made Knight

430

APPENDIX 2: TOPOLOGY PERSONALITIES

in the Order of the Dutch Lion in 1932. He was active setting up a new journal and
he became a founding editor of Compositio Mathematica which began publication
in 1934. During World War II Brouwer was active in helping the Dutch resistance,
and in particular he supported Jewish students during this difficult period. After
retiring in 1951, Brouwer lectured in South Africa in 1952, and the United States
and Canada in 1953. In 1962, despite being well into his 80s, he was offered a post
in Montana. He died in 1966 in Blaricum, The Netherlands as the result of a traffic
accident.

Maurice Fréchet
Maurice Fréchet was born in France
in 1878 and introduced the notions
of metric space and compactness (see
Chapter 7) in his dissertation in 1906.
He held positions at a number of
universities including the University of
Paris from 1928–1948. His research
includes important contributions to
topology, probability, and statistics.
He died in 1973.

Felix Hausdorff
One of the outstanding mathematicians of
the first half of the twentieth century
was Felix Hausdorff.

He did ground-

breaking work in topology, metric spaces,
functional analysis, Lie algebras and set
theory. He was born in Breslau, Germany
– now Wrocław, Poland – in 1868.

He

graduated from, and worked at, University
of Leipzig until 1910 when he accepted
a Chair at the University of Bonn.

In

1935, as a Jew, he was forced to leave
his academic position there by the Nazi
Nuremberg Laws.

He continued to do

research in mathematics for several years,
but could publish his results only outside
Germany. In 1942 he was scheduled to go
to an internment camp, but instead he and
his wife and sister committed suicide.

APPENDIX 2: TOPOLOGY PERSONALITIES

Wacław Sierpiński
Wacław Sierpiński was born in 1882 in Warsaw,
Russian Empire – now Poland.

Fifty years after he

graduated from the University of Warsaw, Sierpiński
looked back at the problems that he had as a Pole taking
his degree at the time of the Russian occupation: . . . we
had to attend a yearly lecture on the Russian language.
. . . Each of the students made it a point of honour to
have the worst results in that subject.

. . . I did not

answer a single question . . . and I got an unsatisfactory
mark. ... I passed all my examinations, then the lector
suggested I should take a repeat examination, otherwise

Sierpinski

I would not be able to obtain the degree of a candidate
for mathematical science. . . . I refused him saying that this would be the first case
at our University that someone having excellent marks in all subjects, having the
dissertation accepted and a gold medal, would not obtain the degree of a candidate
for mathematical science, but a lower degree, the degree of a ‘real student’ (strangely
that was what the lower degree was called) because of one lower mark in the Russian
language.

Sierpiński was lucky for the lector changed the mark on his Russian

language course to ‘good’ so that he could take his degree. Sierpiński graduated
in 1904 and worked as a school teacher of mathematics and physics in a girls’
school. However when the school closed because of a strike, Sierpiński went to
Krakóv to study for his doctorate.

At the Jagiellonian University in Krakóv he

received his doctorate and was appointed to the University of Lvov in 1908. In 1907
Sierpiński for the first time became interested in set theory. He happened across
a theorem which stated that points in the plane could be specified with a single
coordinate. He wrote to Tadeusz Banachiewicz asking him how such a result was
possible. He received a one word reply (Georg) ‘Cantor’. Sierpiński began to study
set theory and in 1909 he gave the first ever lecture course devoted entirely to set
theory. During the years 1908 to 1914, when he taught at the University of Lvov,
he published three books in addition to many research papers. These books were
The theory of Irrational numbers (1910), Outline of Set Theory (1912) and The

433

Theory of Numbers (1912). When World War I began in 1914, Sierpiński and his
family happened to be in Russia. Sierpiński was interned in Viatka. However Dimitri
Feddrovich Egorov and Nikolai Nikolaevich Luzin heard that he had been interned
and arranged for him to be allowed to go to Moscow. Sierpiński spent the rest of the
war years in Moscow working with Luzin. Together they began the study of analytic
sets. When World War I ended in 1918, Sierpiński returned to Lvov. However shortly
after he was accepted a post at the University of Warsaw. In 1919 he was promoted
to Professor spent the rest of his life there. In 1920 Sierpiński, together with his
former student Stefan Mazurkiewicz, founded the important mathematics journal
Fundamenta Mathematica. Sierpiński edited the journal which specialised in papers
on set theory. From this period Sierpiński worked mostly in set theory but also on
point set topology and functions of a real variable. In set theory he made important
contributions to the axiom of choice and to the continuum hypothesis. He studied
the Sierpiński curve which describes a closed path which contains every interior point
of a square – a “space-filling curve”. The length of the curve is infinity, while the
area enclosed by it is 5/12 that of the square. Two fractals – Sierpiński triangle and
Sierpiński carpet – are named after him. Sierpiński continued to collaborate with
Luzin on investigations of analytic and projective sets. Sierpiński was also highly
involved with the development of mathematics in Poland. In 1921 He had been
honoured with election to the Polish Academy was made Dean of the faculty at the
University of Warsaw. In 1928 he became Vice-Chairman of the Warsaw Scientific
Society and, was elected Chairman of the Polish Mathematical Society. In 1939
life in Warsaw changed dramatically with the advent of World War II. Sierpiński
continued working in the ‘Underground Warsaw University’ while his official job was
a clerk in the council offices in Warsaw. His publications continued since he managed
to send papers to Italy. Each of these papers ended with the words: The proofs
of these theorems will appear in the publication of Fundamenta Mathematica which
everyone understood meant ‘Poland will survive’. After the uprising of 1944 the
Nazis burned his house destroying his library and personal letters. Sierpiński spoke
of the tragic events of the war during a lecture he gave in 1945.

He spoke of

his students who had died in the war: In July 1941 one of my oldest students
Stanislaw Ruziewicz was murdered. He was a retired professor of Jan Kazimierz
University in Lvov . . . an outstanding mathematician and an excellent teacher. In

434

APPENDIX 2: TOPOLOGY PERSONALITIES

1943 one of my most distinguished students Stanislaw Saks was murdered.

He

was an Assistant Professor at Warsaw University, one of the leading experts in the
world in the theory of the integral. . . In 1942 another student of mine was Adolf
Lindenbaum was murdered. He was an Assistant Professor at Warsaw University
and a distinguished author of works on set theory.

After listing colleagues who

were murdered in the war such as Juliusz Pawel Schauder and others who died
as a result of the war such as Samuel Dickstein and Stanislaw Zaremba, Sierpiński
continued: Thus more than half of the mathematicians who lectured in our academic
schools were killed. It was a great loss for Polish mathematics which was developing
favourably in some fields such as set theory and topology . . . In addition to the
lamented personal losses Polish mathematics suffered because of German barbarity
during the war, it also suffered material losses. They burned down Warsaw University
Library which contained several thousand volumes, magazines, mathematical books
and thousands of reprints of mathematical works by different authors. Nearly all the
editions of Fundamenta Mathematica (32 volumes) and ten volumes of Mathematical
Monograph were completely burned. Private libraries of all the four Professors of
mathematics from Warsaw University and also quite a number of manuscripts of
their works and handbooks written during the war were burnt too. Sierpiński was
the author of the incredible number of 724 papers and 50 books. He retired in 1960
as Professor at the University of Warsaw but he continued to give a seminar on the
theory of numbers at the Polish Academy of Sciences up to 1967. He also continued
his editorial work, as Editor-in-Chief of Acta Arithmetica which he began in 1958,
and as an editorial board member of Rendiconti dei Circolo Matimatico di Palermo,
Compositio Mathematica and Zentralblatt für Mathematik.

Andrzej Rotkiewicz,

who was a student of Sierpiński’s wrote: Sierpiński had exceptionally good health
and a cheerful nature. . . . He could work under any conditions. Sierpiński died in
1969.

§A3.0 Introduction
In this Appendix we give but a taste of dynamical systems and chaos theory. Most
of the material is covered by way of exercises. Some parts of this Appendix require
some knowledge of calculus. If you have not studied calculus10 you can skip this
Appendix altogether or merely skim through it to get a flavour.

A3.1

Iterates and Orbits

Let S be a set and f a function mapping the set S into
itself; that is, f : S → S . The functions f 1 , f 2 , f 3 , . . . , f n , . . . are inductively
A3.1.1

Definition.

defined as follows:
f 1 : S → S is given by f 1 (x) = f (x); that is f 1 = f ;

f 2 : S → S is given by f 1 (x) = f (f (x)); that is f 2 = f ◦ f ;
f 3 : S → S is given by f 3 (x) = f (f (f (x))); that is, f 3 = f ◦ f ◦ f = f ◦ f 2 ;
and if f n−1 is known then
f n : S → S is defined by f n (x) = f (f n−1 (x)); that is, f n = f ◦ f n−1 .
Each of the the functions f 1 , f 2 , f 3 , . . . , f n , . . . is said to be an iterate of the
function f .
Note that f n+m = f n ◦ f m , for n, m ∈ N.

Let f be a function mapping the set S into itself. If
x0 ∈ S , then the sequence x0 , f 1 (x0 ), f 2 (x0 ), . . . , f n (x0 ), . . . is called the orbit
of the point x0 . The point x0 is called the seed of the orbit.

A3.1.2

Definitions.

There are several possibilities for orbits, but the most important kind is a fixed
point.

A3.1.3

APPENDIX 3: CHAOS THEORY AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

Definition.

Let f be a mapping of a set S into itself. A point

a ∈ S is said to be a fixed point of f if f (a) = a.

A3.1.4

Example.

Graphically, we can find all fixed points of a function

f : R → R, simply by sketching the curve y = f (x) and seeing where it intersects
the line y = x. At points of interesection, and only for these points, do we have
f (x) = x.

Exercises A3.1

1. Let the functions f : R → R, g : R → R and h : R → R be given by
f (x) = x(1 − x), g(x) = x sin x, and h(x) = x2 − 2, for all x ∈ R.
(a) Evaluate f 1 (x) and f 2 (x).
(b) Evaluate g 2 (x) and g 2 (1).

to compute C 10 (123), C 20 (123), C 30 (123), C 40 (123), C 50 (123), C 60 (123),

C 70 (123), C 80 (123), C 90 (123), C 100 (123), C 100 (500) and C 100 (1). What do
you notice?

S 30 (123), S 40 (123), S 50 (123), S 60 (123), S 70 (123), S 80 (123), S 90 (123),

3. Let the function h : R → R be given by h(x) = x2 , for all x ∈ R. Calculate the
orbits for the function h of each of the following seeds: 0, 1, −1, 0.5, 0.25.
4. Find all the fixed points of the function f in Exercise 1 above.
5. Let f : R → R be given by f (x) = x3 − 3x. Find all the fixed points of the
function f .

A3.2

Fixed Points and Periodic Points

A3.2.1

Definition.

Let f be a mapping of a set S into itself. A point

a ∈ S is said to be eventually fixed if a is not a fixed point, but some point on
the orbit of a is a fixed point.

A3.2.2

Definitions.

Let f be a function mapping the set S into itself. If

x ∈ S , then the point x ∈ S is said to be periodic if there exists a positive
integer p such that f p (x) = x. If m is the least n ∈ N such that f n (x) = x,
then m is called the prime period of x.

A3.2.3

Definition.

Let f be a function mapping the set S into itself. Then

the point x0 ∈ S is said to be eventually periodic if x0 is not periodic itself,
but some point in the orbit of x0 is periodic.

A3.2.4

Remark.

We have seen that points may be fixed, eventually fixed,

periodic, or eventually periodic. However, it is important to realize that most points



are not in any of these classes.

Exercises A3.2
1. Verify that the point −1 is an eventually fixed point of f (x) = x2 .
2. Find the eventually fixed points of the function f : R → R given by f (x) = |x|.

441

3. If f : R → R is given by f (x) = − 32 x2 + 25 x + 1, verify that f (0) = 1, f (1) = 2,
and f (2) = 0, so that the orbit of 0 is 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, . . . . Hence 0 is a periodic
point of prime period 3.
4. Prove that if x is a periodic point of prime period m of the function f : S → S ,
then the orbit of x has precisely m points.
[Hint: Firstly write down the orbit of the point x and then deduce that it has at
most m points in it. Next suppose that there are fewer than m distinct points
in the orbit of x and show that this leads to a contradiction to x having period

m.]
5. Let f : R → R be given by f (x) = x2 − 1. Verify that the points

√

2 and 1 are

eventually periodic.
6. Consider the function f : R → R given by f (x) = |1 − x|.
(i) Find all of the fixed points of f .
(ii) If m is an odd integer, what can you say about the orbit of m?
(iii) If m is an even integer, what can you say about the orbit of m?

A3.3

Phase Portraits, Attracting and Repelling Fixed Points

We wish to study dynamical systems, that is processes in motion. Such processes
include for example the motion of planets, but other systems to which this theory
is applied include the weather and population growth. Some even feel the study of
dynamical systems will help us to understand stock market movements.
A very good method for depicting all orbits of a dynamical system is the phase
portrait of the system. This is a picture on the real line of the orbits.
In the phase portrait we represent fixed points by solid dots and the dynamics
along orbits by arrows.

442

APPENDIX 3: CHAOS THEORY AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

if f (x) = x3 , then the fixed points are 0, 1, and −1. If
|x0 | < 1 then the orbit of x0 is a sequence which tends to 0; we write this f n (x0 ) → 0.
If |x0 | > 1, then the orbit is a sequence which diverges to ∞; that is, f n (x0 ) → ±∞.
A3.3.1

Example.

The phase portrait is given below:


A3.3.2

Definition.

Let a be a fixed point of the function f : R → R. The

point a is said to be an attracting fixed point of f if there is an open interval
I containing a such that if x ∈ I , then f n (x) → a as n → ∞.

A3.3.3

Definition.

Let a be a fixed point of the function f : R → R. The

point a is said to be a repelling fixed point of f if there is is an open interval

I containing a such that if x ∈ I with x 6= a then there is an integer n such
that f n (x) ∈
/ I.

A3.3.4

Example.

Observe that 0 is an attracting fixed point of f (x) = x3 ,

while −1 and 1 are repelling fixed points of this function.

A3.3.5

Definition.

A fixed point which is neither repelling nor attracting

is called a neutral fixed point.

Graphical Analysis

A3.4.1

Remark.

We have used phase portraits to determine whether a point

x0 is fixed, periodic, eventually periodic etc. This method is particularly useful when
we are dealing with more than one dimension. But for functions f : R → R, we can
use graphical analysis. This is done as follows.
Given a function f : R → R, we are asked to determine the nature of the point

x0 ∈ R. What we do is find the orbits of points a near to x0 . We begin by sketching
the function f and superimposing on its graph the graph of the line y = x.
To find the orbit of the point a, plot the point (a, a). Next draw a vertical line
to meet the graph of f at the point (a, f (a)). Then draw a horizontal line to meet
the line y = x at the point f (a), f (a). Now draw a vertical line to meet the graph
of f at the point (f (a), f 2 (a)). Once again draw a horizontal line to meet the line

y = x at the point (f 2 (a), f 2 (a)). We continue this process and the points a, f (a),
f 2 (a), f 3 (a), . . . form the orbit of a.


445

Example.
We will now consider the function f : R → R, given by
f (x) = x4 . We sketch the curve y = x4 and superimpose the line y = x. To find

A3.4.2

the fixed points we can solve f (x) = x; that is, solve x4 = x.
It is readily seen that the fixed points are 0 and 1. We will consider points near
each of these and do a graphical analysis, as described above, to find the orbits of
points near 0 and near 1. The analysis in the diagram below shows what happens
to points near to 1.


The next examples show graphical analyses of two more functions to indicate
how different these can be for different functions. You will then get experience doing
graphical analysis yourself.

Bifurcation

A3.5.1

Remark.

It is natural to ask if every continuous function f : S → R

has a fixed point, where S ⊆ R? The answer is easily seen to be no . For example,
if f : R → R is given by f (x) = x + 1, then obviously there are no fixed points.
Therefore it is remarkable that we can guarantee the existence of fixed points of
all continuous functions of [0, 1] into itself. More precisely, we have already seen
and proved the following corollary:

5.2.11

Corollary.

(Fixed Point Theorem)

Let f be a continuous

mapping of [0, 1] into [0, 1]. Then there exists a z ∈ [0, 1] such that f (z) = z .

Of course the above corollary does not help us to find the fixed point, rather it
tells us only that at least one fixed point exists.
It would also be nice to have a simple way of establishing whether a particular
fixed point is attracting, repelling, or neutral. For well-behaved functions Theorems
A3.5.2 and A3.5.3 will be very useful in this regard.



450

APPENDIX 3: CHAOS THEORY AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

A3.5.2

Theorem.

Let S be an interval in R and a be a point in the interior

of S . Further, let a be a fixed point of a function f : S → R. If f is differentiable
at the point a and |f 0 (a)| < 1, then a is an attracting fixed point of f .

As |f 0 (a)| < 1, we have |f 0 (a)| < k < 1, where k is the postive real
|f 0 (a)|+1
number given by k =
.
2
f (x)−f (a)
By definition, f 0 (a) = lim
x−a . So for x “close enough” to a, we have
x→a
f (x)−f (a)
| x−a | ⩽ k ; more precisely, there exists an interval I = [a − δ, a + δ], for some
f (x)−f (a)
δ > 0, such that | x−a | ⩽ k , for all x ∈ I with x 6= a.
Since a is a fixed point, f (a) = a. So
Proof.

|f (x) − a| ⩽ k|x − a| ,

for all x ∈ I .

(1)

This implies that f (x) is closer to a than x is, and so f (x) is in I too. So we can
repeat the same argument with f (x) replacing x and obtain

|f 2 (x) − a| ⩽ k|f (x) − a| ,

for all x ∈ I .

(2)

for all x ∈ I.

(3)

From (1) and (2), we obtain

|f 2 (x) − a| ⩽ k 2 |x − a| ,

Noting that |k| < 1 implies that k 2 < 1, we can repeat the argument again. By
mathematical induction we obtain,

|f n (x) − a| ⩽ k n |x − a| ,

for all x ∈ I and n ∈ N.

(4)

As |k| < 1, lim k n = 0. By (4) this implies that f n (x) → a as n → ∞. And we
n→∞
have proved that a is an attracting fixed point.

The proof of Theorem A3.5.3 is analogous to that of Theorem A3.5.2 and so
is left as an exercise.
A3.5.3

Theorem.

Let S be an interval in R and a an interior point of S .

Further, let a be a fixed point of a function f : S → R. If f is differentiable at
the point a and |f 0 (a)| > 1, then a is a repelling fixed point of f .

451

A3.5.4

Remark.

It is important to note that Theorem A3.5.2 and Theorem

A3.5.3 do not give necessary and sufficient conditions. Rather they say that if
f 0 exists and |f 0 (x)| < 1 in an interval containing the fixed point a, then a is
an attracting fixed point; and if |f 0 (x)| > 1 in an interval containing the fixed
point a, then a is a repelling fixed point.

If neither of these conditions is true

we can say nothing! For example, it is possible that f is not differentiable at a
but f still
an attracting fixed point at a. (This is the case, for example for
 has
2
x for x ∈ Q
f (x) =
which has 0 as an attracting fixed point.)
−x2 for x ∈ R \ Q,
Even if f is differentiable at a, Theorems A3.1.17 and A3.1.18 tell us absolutely
nothing if f 0 (a) = 1. Consider f (x) = sin x. This function is differentiable at 0 with

f 0 (0) = cos(0) = 1. So Theorems A3.1.17 and A3.1.18 tell us nothing. However, 0
is an attracting fixed point of f .


A3.5.5

Remark.

One of the most important family of functions in this theory
is the family of quadratic maps Qc : R → R, where c ∈ R, and Qc (x) = x2 + c.
For each different value of c we get a different quadratic function. But the surprising
feature is that the dynamics of Qc changes as c changes. The following theorem
indicates this. We leave the proof of the theorem as an exercise.

452

APPENDIX 3: CHAOS THEORY AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

A3.5.6

Theorem.

(The First Bifurcation Theorem)

Let Qc be the

quadratic function for c ∈ R.
(i) If c > 41 , then all orbits tend to infinity; that is, for all x ∈ R, (Qc )n (x) → ∞
as n → ∞.
(ii) If c = 14 , then Qc has precisely one fixed point at x = 12 and this is a neutral
fixed point.

√
(iii) If c < 14 , then Qc has two fixed points a+ = 21 (1 + 1 − 4c) and
√
a− = 21 (1 − 1 − 4c).
(a) The point a+ is always repelling.
(b) If − 43 < c < 14 , then a− is attracting.
(c) If c < − 43 , then a− is repelling.

A3.5.7

Remark.

The term bifurcation means a division into two. We see
in the above theorem that for c > 14 there are no fixed points; for c = 14 there is
precisely one fixed point; but for c < 41 this fixed point splits into two — one at a+
and one at a− . We will say more about bifurcation presently.

Let f be a function mapping the set S into itself. If the
point x ∈ S has prime period m, then the orbit of x is {x, f (x), . . . , f m−1 (x)}

A3.5.8

Definition.

and the orbit is called an m-cycle.

Let a be a periodic point of a function f : S → S of
prime period m, for some m ∈ N. [So a is clearly a fixed point of f m : S → S .]

A3.5.9

Definitions.

Then a is said to be an attracting periodic point of f if it is an attracting
fixed point of f m . Similarly a is said to be a repelling periodic point of f if it
is a repelling fixed point of f n m.

453

The following theorem is left as an exercise.

A3.5.10

Theorem.

(The Second Bifurcation Theorem)

Let Qc be

the quadratic function for c ∈ R.
(a) If − 43 ⩽ c < 14 , then Qc has no 2-cycles.
(b) If − 45 < c < − 43 , then Qc has an attracting 2-cycle, {q− , q+ }, where
√
√
q+ = 21 (−1 + −4c − 3) and q− = 12 (−1 − −4c − 3).
(c) If c < − 45 , then Qc has a repelling 2-cycle {q− , q+ }.

A3.5.11

Remark.

In The Second Bifurcation Theorem we saw a new kind of
bifurcation called a period doubling bifurcation. As c decreases below − 34 , two
things happen: the fixed point a− changes from attracting to repelling and a new
2-cycle, {q− , q+ } appears. Note that when c = − 34 , we have q− = q+ = − 12 = a− .
So these two new periodic points originated at a− when c = − 43 .
We will have more to say about period doubling bifurcations when we consider
one-parameter families of functions (such as Qc : R → R, which depends on the
parameter c, and the logistic functions fλ (x) = λx(1 − x), which depend on the
parameter λ).

The Magic of Period 3: Period 3 Implies Chaos

A3.6.1

Remark.

In 1964, the Soviet mathematician A.N. Sarkovskii published

the paper (Sarkovskii [356]) in Russian in a Ukranian journal.

There he proved

a remarkable theorem which went unnoticed. In 1975 James Yorke and T-Y. Li
published the paper (Yorke and Li [427]) in the American Mathematical Monthly.
Even though the term “chaos” had previously been used in scientific literature, it
was this paper that initiated the popularisation of the term. The main result of
the paper, The Period Three Theorem, is astonishing, but is a very special case of
Sarkovskii’s Theorem, proved a decade earlier. The discussion here of The Period
Three Theorem is based on the presentation by Robert L. Devaney in his book
(Devaney [101]).

A3.6.2

Theorem.

(The Period Three Theorem)

Let f : R → R be a

continuous function. If f has a periodic point of prime period 3, then for each

n ∈ N it has a periodic point of prime period n.

Proof.

APPENDIX 3: CHAOS THEORY AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

A3.6.3

Remark.

The Period Three Theorem is remarkable. But as stated

earlier, a much more general result is true. It is known as Sarkovskii’s Theorem. We
shall not give a proof, but simply point out that the proof is of a similar nature to
that above.
To state Sarkovskii’s Theorem we need to order the natural numbers is the
following curious way known as Sarkovskii’s ordering of the natural numbers:

3, 5, 7, 9, . . .
2 · 3, 2 · 5, 2 · 7, . . .
22 · 3, 22 · 5, 22 · 7 . . .
23 · 3, 23 · 5, 23 · 7 . . .
..
.
. . . , 2n , 2n−1 , . . . , 23 , 22 , 21 , 1.

A3.6.4

Theorem.

(Sarkovskii’s Theorem)

Let f : R → R be a

continuous function. If f has a periodic point of prime period n and n precedes

k in Sarkovskii’s ordering of the natural numbers, then f has a periodic point
of prime period k .

457

A3.6.5

Remarks.

(i)

Firstly observe that as 3 appears first in Sarkovskii’s

ordering of the natural numbers, Sarkovskii’s Theorem implies The Period Three
Theorem.
(ii) Secondly note that as the numbers of the form 2n constitute the tail of
Sarkovskii’s ordering of the natural numbers, it follows that if f has only a
finite number of periodic points, then they must all be of the form 2n .
(iii) Thirdly note that Sarkovskii’s Theorem applies to continuous functions from R
into itself.

If R is replaced by other spaces the theorem may become false.

However, R can be replaced by any closed interval [a, b].

To see this let

f : [a, b] → [a, b] be a continuous function. Then extend f to a continuous
function f 0 : R → R by defining f 0 (x) = f (x), for x ∈ [a, b]; f 0 (x) = f (a) if
x < a; and f 0 (x) = f (b), if x > b. Then the Theorem for f can be deduced
from the Theorem for f 0 .
It is remarkable that the converse of Sarkovskii’s Theorem is also true but we
shall not prove it here. See (Dunn [116])

A3.6.6

Theorem.

(Converse of Sarkovskii’s Theorem)

Let n ∈ N

and l precede n in Sarkovskii’s ordering of the natural numbers. Then there
exists a continuous function f : R → R which has a periodic point of prime
period n, but no periodic point of prime period l.

A3.6.7

Remark.

From the Converse of Sarkovskii’s Theorem it follows, for

example, that there exists a continuous function of R into itself which has a periodic
point of prime period 6, and hence a periodic point of prime period of each even
number, but no periodic point of odd prime period except 1.

(v) Deduce that, under the condition in (ii), f ([s, t]) = [c, d] = J , as required.

that f (x0 ) = b needs to be eliminated. This can be done by observing that
f 3 (x0 ) ∈ I1 , but f 2 (b) = a ∈

Chaotic Dynamical Systems

A3.7.1

Remarks.

Today there are literally thousands of published research

papers and hundreds of books dealing with chaotic dynamical systems. These are
related to a variety of disciplines including art, biology, economics, ecology and
finance. It would be folly to try to give a definitive history of chaos, a term used
in the book of Genesis in the Bible and Hun-Tun (translated as chaos) in Taoism
(Girardot [159]), a philospohical tradition dating back 2,200 years in China to the
Han Dynasty. Here we focus on the twentieth century.
It would also be folly to try here to give the “correct” definition of the
mathematical concept of chaos. Rather, we shall give one reasonable definition,

461

noting there are others which are inequivalent. Indeed some mathematicians assert
that no existing definition captures precisely what we want chaos to be.
As stated earlier, the 1975 paper of Yorke and Li [427] triggered widespread
interest in chaotic dynamical systems. However the previous year the Australian
scientist Robert M. May, later Lord Robert May and President of the prestigious
Royal Society of London published the paper [279] in which he stated “Some of
the simplest nonlinear difference equations describing the growth of biological
populations with nonoverlapping generations can exhibit a remarkable spectrum
of dynamical behavior, from stable equilibrium points, to stable cyclic
oscillations between 2 population points, to stable cycles with 4, 8, 16, .
. . points, through to a chaotic regime in which (depending on the initial
population value) cycles of any period, or even totally aperiodic but bounded
population fluctuations, can occur.”
Jules Henri Poincaré (1854–1912), one of France’s greatest mathematicians,
is acknowledged as one of the founders of a number of fields of mathematics
including modern nonlinear dynamics, ergodic theory, and topology. His work laid
the foundations for chaos theory. He stated in his 1903 book, a translated version
of which was republished in 2003 (Poincarè [328]): “If we knew exactly the laws
of nature and the situation of the universe at its initial moment, we could
predict exactly the situation of that same universe at a succeeding moment.
But even if it were the case that the natural laws had no longer any secret
for us, we could still only know the initial situation approximately. If that
enabled us to predict the succeeding situation with the same approximation,
that is all we require, and we should say that the phenomenon had been
predicted, that it is governed by laws. But it is not always so; it may happen
that small differences in the initial conditions produce very great ones in
the final phenomena. A small error in the former will produce an enormous
error in the latter. Prediction becomes impossible”. What Poincaré described
quite precisely has subsequently become known colloquially as the butterfly effect,
an essential feature of chaos.

APPENDIX 3: CHAOS THEORY AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

In 1952 Collier’s magazine published a short story called “A Sound of Thunder”
by the renowned author, Ray Bradbury (1920–2012).

In the story, http://www.

lasalle.edu/~didio/courses/hon462/hon462_assets/sound_of_thunder.htm a party of rich
businessmen use time travel to journey back to a prehistoric era and go on a safari to
hunt dinosaurs. However, one of the hunters accidentally kills a prehistoric butterfly,
and this innocuous event dramatically changes the future world that they left. This
was perhaps the incentive for a meteorologist’s presentation in 1973 to the American
Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington , D.C. being given
the name “Predictability: Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a
tornado in Texas?” The meteorologist was Edward Norton Lorenz (1917–2008) and
the flapping wing represented a tiny change in initial conditions causing enormous
changes later. Lorenz discovered sensitivity to initial conditions by accident. He
was running on a computer a mathematical model to predict the weather. Having
run a particular sequence, he decided to replicate it.

He re-entered the number

from his printout, taken part-way through the sequence, and let it run.

What

he found was that the new results were radically different from his first results.
Because his printout rounded to three decimal places, he had entered the number
.506 than the six digit number .506127. Even so, he would have expected that the
resulting sequence would differ only slightly from the original run. Since repeated
experimentation proved otherwise, Lorenz concluded that the slightest difference
in initial conditions made a dramatic difference to the outcome.

So prediction

was in fact impossible. Sensitivity to initial conditions, or the butterfly effect, had
been demonstrated to be not just of theoretical importance but in fact of practical
importance in meteorology. It was a serious limitation to predicting the weather –
at least with that model. Perhaps this effect was evident also in a variety of other
practical applications.
The American mathematicians George David Birkoff (1884-1944) and Harold
Calvin Marston Morse (1892–1977) continued Poincaré’s work on dynamical systems.
While Poincaré had made use of topology in the theory of dynamical systems,
Birkhoff, in particular, supplemented this by the use of Lebesgue measure theory. In
1931 Birkhoff and P.A. Smith in their paper [43] introduced the concept of metric
transitivity which is central in ergodic theory and was used by Robert L. Devaney in
1986 in his widely published definition of, and approach to, chaos.

463

The three conditions: transitivity, sensitivity to initial conditions, and density of
of periodic points as appeared in The Period Three Theorem, were precisely what
Devaney used in his definition of chaos.

A3.7.2

Definition.



Let (X, d) be a metric space and f : X → X a mapping

of the set X into itself. Then (X, f ) is said to be a dynamical system.

A3.7.3

Remark.

It would be much more appropriate to denote the dynamical

system as (X, d, f ), however in the literature the convention is not do this.

A3.7.4

Definition.

Let (X, d) be a metric space and f : X → X a mapping

of X into itself. Then the dynamical system (X, f ) is said to be transitive if
given x, y ∈ X , and any ε > 0, there exists a z ∈ X and an n ∈ N, such that
d(z, y) < ε and d(f n (z), x) < ε.

A3.7.5

Remark.

Roughly speaking, transitivity says that there is a point z

“close” to y such that some point in the orbit of z is “close” to x.
A3.7.6

Remark.

At long last we shall define chaos. However, care needs to

be taken as there is a number of inequivalent definitions of chaos in the literature as
well as many writers who are vague about what they mean by chaos. Our definition
is that used by Robert L. Devaney, with a modification resulting from the work of a
group of Australian mathematicians, Banks et al. [31], in 1992.

A3.7.7

Definition.

The dynamical system (X, f ) is said to be chaotic if

(i) the set of all periodic points of f is dense in the set X , and
(ii) (X, f ) is transitive.

464

A3.7.8

APPENDIX 3: CHAOS THEORY AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

Remark.

Until 1992 it was natural to add a third condition in the

definition of chaotic dynamical systems. This condition is that in the dynamical
system (X, f ), f depends sensitively on initial conditions. However in 1992 a group
of mathematicians from La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia proved that this
condition is automatically true if the two conditions in Definition A3.7.7 hold. Their
work appeared in the paper “On Devaney’s definition of chaos" by the authors John
Banks, Gary Davis, Peter Stacey, Jeff Brooks and Grant Cairns in the American
Mathematical Monthly (Banks et al. [31]). See also (Banks et al. [32]).

A3.7.9

Definition.

The dynamical system (X, f ) is said to depend

sensitively on initial conditions if there exists a β > 0 such that for any

x ∈ X and any ε > 0 there exists n ∈ N and y ∈ X with d(x, y) < ε such that
d(f n (x), f n (y)) > β .

A3.7.10

Remark.

This definition says that no matter which x we begin

with and how small a neighbourhood of x we choose, there is always a y in this
neighbourhood whose orbit separates from that of x by at least β .

[And β is

independent of x.]
A3.7.11

Remark.

What we said in Remark A3.7.8 is that every chaotic

dynamical system depends sensitively on initial conditions. We shall not prove
this here. But we will show in Exercises A3.7 #2 that the doubling map does indeed
depend sensitively on initial conditions.

A3.7.12

Remark.

In 1994, Michel Vellekoop and Raoul Berglund [402] proved

that in the special case that (X, d) is a finite or infinite interval with the Euclidean
metric, then transitivity implies condition (ii) in Definition A3.7.7, namely that the
set of all periodic points is dense. However, David Asaf and Steve Gadbois [213]
showed this is not true for general metric spaces.

465

Exercises A3.7
1. Let D : [0, 1) → [0, 1) given by D(x) = 2x (mod 1) be the doubling map. Prove
that the dynamical system ([0, 1), D) is chaotic.

periodic points of D is

and that the set P is dense in [0, 1). So condition (i) of Definition A3.7.7 is
satisfied. To verify condition (ii) use the following steps:
(a) Let x, y ∈ [0, 1) and ε > 0 be given. Let n ∈ N be such that 2−n < ε. For

k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}, let

(c) Deduce from (b) that there exists a z ∈ Jk,n such that f n (z) = y .
(d) Deduce that z has the required properties of Definition A3.7.4 and so

([0, 1), D) is a transitive dynamical system.
(e) Deduce that ([0, 1), D) is a chaotic dynamical system.]
2. Prove that the doubling map of Exercise 1 above depends sensitively on initial
conditions.
[Hints. Let β = 14 . Given any ε > 0, let n ∈ N be such that 2−n < ε. Put
s = f n (x) + 0.251 (mod 1). Firstly, verify that d(f n (x), s) > β . As observed
in Exercise 1(a), x ∈ Jk,n , for some k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}. But by Exercise 1(b),
f n (Jk,n ) = [0, 1). Let y ∈ Jk,n be such that f n (y) = s. Now verify that y has
the required properties (i) d(x, y) < ε and (ii) d(f n (x), f n (y) > β .]
3. Let m be a (fixed) positive integer and consider the dynamical system ([0, 1), fm )
where fm (x) = mx (mod 1). Prove that ([0, 1), fm ) is chaotic.
[Hint.

See Exercise 1 above.]

466

APPENDIX 3: CHAOS THEORY AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

4. Let (X,

τ ) be a topological space and f a continuous mapping of X into itself.

Then f is said to be topologically transitive if for any pair of non-empty open
sets U and V in (X, ) there exists an n ∈ N such that f k (U ) ∩ V 6= Ø. For

τ

X, d) a metric space and τ the topology induced by the metric d, prove that f
is transitive if and only if it is topologically transitive.

A3.8

Conjugate Dynamical Systems

A3.8.1

Definition.

Let (X1 , d1 ) and (X2 , d2 ) be metric spaces and (X1 , f1 )

and (X2 , f2 ) dynamical systems.

Then (X1 , f1 ) and (X2 , f2 ) are said to be

conjugate dynamical systems if there is a homeomorphism h : (X1 , d1 ) →

(X, d2 ) such that f2 ◦ h = h ◦ f1 ; that is, f2 (h(x)) = h(f1 (x)), for all x ∈ X1 .
The map h is called a conjugate map.

3A.8.2

Remark.

In Exercises A3.8 #2 it is verfied that if (X1 , f1 ) and (X2 , f2 )

are conjugate dynamical systems, then (X2 , f2 ) and (X1 , f1 ) are conjugate dynamical
systems. So we see that the order in which the dynamical systems are considered is



of no importance.

A3.8.3

Remark.

Conjugate dynamical systems are equivalent in the same

sense that homeomorphic topological spaces are equivalent.

The next theorem

demonstrates this fact. Very often it will be possible to analyze a complex dynamical
system by showing it is conjugate to one we already understand.



467

A3.8.4

Theorem.

Let (X1 , f1 ) and (X2 , f2 ) be conjuagate dynamical

systems, where h is the conjugate map.
(i) A point x ∈ X1 is a fixed point of f1 in X1 if and only if h(x) is a fixed
point of f2 in X2 .
(ii) A point x ∈ X1 is a periodic point of period n ∈ N of f1 in X1 if and only
if h(x) is a periodic point of period n of f2 in X2 .
(iii) The dynamical system (X, f1 ) is chaotic if and only if the dynamical system

(X, f2 ) is chaotic.
Proof.

(i) and (ii) are straightforward and left as exercises for you.

To see (iii), assume that (X1 , f1 ) is chaotic. Let P be the set of periodic points
of f1 . As (X1 , f1 ) is chaotic, P is dense in X1 . As h is a continuous, it is easily seen
that h(P ) is dense in the set h(X1 ) = X2 . As h(P ) is the set of periodic points of
(X2 , f2 ), it follows (X2 , f2 ) satisfies condition (i) of Definition A3.7.7.
To complete the proof, we need to show that (X2 , f2 ) is transitive. To this end,
let ε > 0 and u, v ∈ X2 . Then there are x, y ∈ X1 such that h(x) = u and h(y) = v .
Since h is continuous, it is continuous at the points x, y ∈ X1 . Thus, there exists a
δ > 0 such that

z ∈ X1

and

d1 (x, z) < δ ⇒ d2 (h(x), h(z)) < ε,

(12.1)

z 0 ∈ X1

and

d1 (y, z 0 ) < δ ⇒ d2 (h(y), h(z 0 )) < ε.

(12.2)

As (X1 , f1 ) is transitive, there is a z ∈ X1 and n ∈ N, such that
d1 (x, z) < δ ⇒ d1 (f1n (z), y) < δ.

(12.3)

and

Let z be chosen so that (12.3) holds, and put w = h(z). Using this value for z in
(12.1), and taking f1n (z) as z 0 in (12.2), we obtain

d2 (u, w) = d2 (h(x), h(z)) < ε,

from (12.1) and (12.3)

(12.4)

and

d2 (f2n (w), v) = d2 (f2n (h(z)), h(y)),
= d2 (h(f1n (z), h(y)), as
< ε,

h ◦ f1 = f2 ◦ h,
(12.5)

from (2) and (3). Now from (12.4) and (12.5) it follows that (X2 , f2 ) is transitive.

APPENDIX 4: HAUSDORFF DIMENSION

§A4.0 Introduction
In this section we introduce the notion of Hausdorff Dimension which plays an
important role in the study of fractals.

A4.1

Hausdorff Dimension

We begin by warning the reader that this section is significantly more complicated
than much of the material in the early chapters of this book.

Further, an

understanding of this section is not essential to the understanding of the rest of
the book.
We think of points as 0-dimensional, lines as 1-dimensional, squares as 2dimensional, cubes as 3-dimensional etc. So intuitively we think we know what the
notion of dimension is. For arbitrary topological spaces there are competing notions
of topological dimension.

In “nice” spaces, the different notions of topological
dimension tend to coincide. However, even the well-behaved euclidean spaces, Rn ,

n > 1, have surprises in store for us.
In 1919 Felix Hausdorff [172] introduced the notion of Hausdorff dimension of
a metric space.

A surprising feature of Hausdorff dimension is that it can have

values which are not integers. This topic was developed by Abram Samoilovitch
Besicovitch [40] a decade or so later, but came into prominence in the 1970s with
the work of Benoit Mandelbrot on what he called fractal geometry and which spurred
the development of chaos theory. Fractals and chaos theory have been used in a
very wide range of disciplines including economics, finance, meteorology, physics,
and physiology.
We begin with a discussion of Hausdorff measure (or what some call HausdorffBesicovitch measure).

Some readers will be familiar with the related notion of

Lebesgue measure, however such an understanding is not essential here.

A4.1.1

Definition.

Let Y be a subset of a metric space (X, d). Then the

number sup{d(x, y) : x, y ∈ Y } is said to be the diameter of the set Y and is
denoted diam Y .

471

A4.1.2

Definition.

Let Y be a subset of a metric space (X, d), I an index

set, ε a positive real number, and {Ui : i ∈ I} a family of subsets of X such
that Y ⊆

S

Ui and, for each i ∈ I , diam Ui < ε. Then {Ui : i ∈ I} is said to

i∈I
be an ε-covering of the set Y .

We are particularly interested in ε-coverings which are countable. So we are led
to ask: which subsets of a metric space have countable ε-coverings for all ε > 0?
The next Proposition provides the answer.

A4.1.3

Proposition.

Let Y be a subset of a metric space (X, d) and d1

the induced metric on Y . Then Y has a countable ε-covering for all ε > 0 if
and only if (Y, d1 ) is separable.

Proof.

Assume that Y has a countable ε-covering for all ε > 0. In particular Y

has a countable (1/n)-covering, {Un,i : i ∈ N}, for each n ∈ N. Let yn,i be any
point in Y ∩ Un,i . We shall see that the countable set {yn,i : i ∈ N, n ∈ N} is dense
in Y. Clearly for each y ∈ Y , there exists an i ∈ N, such that d(y, yn,i ) < 1/n. So
let O be any open set intersecting Y non-trivially. Let y ∈ O ∩ Y . Then O contains
an open ball B centre y of radius 1/n, for some n ∈ N. So yn,i ∈ O , for some i ∈ N.
Thus {yn,i : i ∈ N, n ∈ N} is dense in Y and so Y is separable.
Conversely, assume that Y is separable. Then it has a countable dense subset

{yi : i ∈ N}. Indeed, given any y ∈ Y and any ε > 0, there exists a yi , i ∈ N, such
that d(y, yi ) < ε/2. So the family of all {Ui : i ∈ N}, where Ui is the open ball
centre yi and radius ε/2 is an ε-covering of Y , as required.

We are now able to define the Hausdorff s-dimensional measure of a subset of
a metric space. More precisely, we shall define this measure for separable subsets of
a metric space. Of course, if (X, d) is a separable metric space, such as Rn , for any

n ∈ N, then all of its subsets are separable. (See Exercises 6.3 #15.)

472

APPENDIX 4: HAUSDORFF DIMENSION

A4.1.4

Definition.

Let Y be a separable subset of a metric space (X, d)

and s a positive real number. For each positive real number ε < 1, put

)
(
X
(diam Ui )s : {Ui : i ∈ N} is an ε-covering of Y , and
Hεs (Y ) = inf

Hs (Y ) =

 i∈Ns
 lim Hε (Y ),

if the limit exists;


∞,

otherwise.

ε→0
ε>0

Then Hs (Y ) is said to be the s-dimensional Hausdorff outer measure of the
set Y .

A4.1.5 Remark.
Note that in Definition A4.1.4, if ε1 < ε2 , then Hεs1 (Y ) ⩾
Hεs2 (Y ). So as ε tends to 0, either the limit of Hεs (Y ) exists or it tends to ∞. This
helps us to understand the definition of Hs (Y ).


It is important to note that if d1 is the metric induced on Y
by the metric d on X , then Hs (Y ) depends only on the metric d1 on Y . In other
words if Y is also a subset of the metric space (Z, d2 ) and d2 induces the same
metric d1 on Y , then Hs (Y ) is the same when considered as a subset of (X, d) or
(Y, d2 ). So, for example, the s-dimensional Hausdorff outer measure is the same for
the closed interval [0,1] whether considered as a subset of R or of R2 or indeed of
A4.1.6

Remark.

Rn , for any positive integer n.



473

A4.1.7

Lemma.

Let Y be a separable subset of a metric space (X, d), s

and t positive real numbers with s < t, and ε a positive real number < 1. Then
(i) Hεt (Y ) ⩽ Hεs (Y ), and
(ii) Hεt (Y ) ⩽ εt−s Hεs (Y ).

Part (i) is an immediate consequence of the fact that ε < 1 and so each
diam Ui < 1, which implies (diam Ui )t < (diam Ui )s . Part (ii) follows from the fact
that diam Ui < ε < 1 and so (diam Ui )t < εt−s (diam Ui )s .


Proof.

A4.1.8

Proposition.

Let Y be a separable subset of a metric space (X, d)

and s and t positive real numbers with s < t.
(i) If Hs (Y ) < ∞, then Ht (Y ) = 0.
(ii) If 0 6= Ht (Y ) < ∞, then Hs (Y ) = ∞.

Proof.

These follow immediately from Definition A4.1.3 and Lemma A4.1.7ii).

From Proposition A4.1.8 we see that if Hs (Y ) is finite and
non-zero for some value of s, then for all larger values of s, Hs (Y ) equals 0 and for
A4.1.9

Remark.

all smaller values of s, Hs (Y ) equals ∞.



Proposition A4.1.8 allows us to define Hausdorff dimension.

A4.1.10

Definition.

Let Y be a separable subset of a metric space (X, d).

Then



dimH (Y ) =

inf{s ∈ [0, ∞) : Hs (Y ) = 0},
∞,

if Hs (Y ) = 0 for some s > 0;
otherwise

is called the Hausdorff dimension of the set Y .

474

APPENDIX 4: HAUSDORFF DIMENSION

We immediately obtain the following Proposition.
A4.1.11

Let Y be a separable subset of a metric space

Proposition.

(X, d). Then

0,
dimH (Y ) = sup{s ∈ [0, ∞) : Hs (Y ) = ∞},

Hs (Y ) =
∞, if s < dimH (Y ).

(i)

(ii)

if Hs (Y ) = 0 for all s;
if the supremum exists;
otherwise.


The calculation of the Hausdorff dimension of a metric space is not an easy
exercise. But here is an instructive example.
A4.1.12

Example.

Let Y be any finite subset of a metric space (X, d). Then

dimH (Y ) = 0.
Proof.

Put Y = {y1 , y2 , . . . , yN }, N ∈ N. Let Oε (i) be the open ball centre yi

and radius ε/2. Then {Oi : i = 1, . . . , N } is an ε-covering of Y . So

(

X
Hεs (Y ) = inf
(diam Ui )s : {Ui } an open covering of Y }
i∈N

N
X

(diam Oi )s = εs .N s+1 /2s .

i=1
Thus Hs (Y ) ⩽ lim εs .N s+1 /2s = 0.
ε→0
ε>0
dimH (Y ) = 0.

So Hs (Y ) = 0, for all s > 0.

Hence



The next Proposition is immediate.

A4.1.13

Proposition.

If (Y1 , d1 ) and (Y2 , d2 ) are isometric metric spaces,

then

dimH (Y1 ) = dimH (Y2 ).

475

A4.1.14

Proposition.

Let Z and Y be separable subsets of a metric space

(X, d). If Z ⊂ Y , then dimH (Z) ⩽ dimH (Y ).

Proof.



(X, d). Then
Hs (Y ) ⩽

A4.1.16

Proposition.

Let Y =

S

Yi be a separable subset of a metric

i∈N
space (X, d). Then

dimH (Y ) = sup{dimH (Yi ) : i ∈ N}.

Proof.

It follows immediately from Lemma A4.1.15 that

dimH (Y ) ⩽ sup{dimH (Yi ) : i ∈ N}.
However, by Proposition A4.1.14, dimH (Y ) ⩾ dimH (Yi ), for each i ∈ N. Putting
these two observations together completes the proof of the Proposition.



476

APPENDIX 4: HAUSDORFF DIMENSION

A4.1.17

Proposition.

If Y is a countable subset of a metric space (X, d),

then dimH (Y ) = 0.

Proof.

This follows immediately from Proposition A4.1.16 and Example A4.1.12


In particular, Proposition A4.1.17 tells us that dimH (Q) = 0.

A4.1.18

Example.

Let [a, a + 1], a ∈ R be a closed interval in R, where R has

the euclidean metric. Then dimH [a, a + 1] = dimH [0, 1] = dimH (R).
Proof.

Let da be the metric induced on [a, a + 1] by the euclidean metric on

R. Then ([a, a + 1], da ) is isometric to ([0, 1], d0 ), and so by Proposition A4.1.13,
dimH [a, a + 1] = dimH [0, 1].

Now observe that R =

dimH (R) = sup{dimH [a, a+1] : a = . . . , −n, . . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . . , n, . . . } = dimH [0, 1],
as each dimH [a, a + 1] = dimH [0, 1].

A4.1.19

Proposition.

Let (X, d1 ) and (Y, d2 ) be separable metric spaces

and f : X → Y a surjective function. If there exist positive real numbers a and

b, such that for all x1 , x2 ∈ X ,
a.d1 (x1 , x2 ) ⩽ d2 (f (x1 ), f (x2 )) ⩽ b.d1 (x1 , x2 ),
then dimH (X, d1 ) = dimH (Y, d2 ).

In some cases Proposition A4.1.19 is useful in calculating

the Hausdorff dimension of a space. See Exercises 6.6 #7 and #8.
Another useful device in calculating Hausdorff dimension is to refine the definition

APPENDIX 4: HAUSDORFF DIMENSION

A4.1.24

Proposition.

Let [0, 1] denote the closed unit interval with the

euclidean metric. Then dimH [0, 1] = 1.

From Proposition A4.1.11, it suffices to show that 0 6= H1 [0, 1] < ∞.
This is the case if we show H1 [0, 1] = 1.
Proof.

For any 1 > ε > 0, it is clear that the interval [0, 1] can be covered by nε
intervals each of diameter less than ε, where nε ⩽ 2 + 1/ε. So Hε1 [0, 1] ⩽ ε(2 + 1/ε);
that is, Hε1 [0, 1] ⩽ 1 + 2ε. Thus H1 [0, 1] ⩽ 1. From Example A4.1.23, we now have
H1 [0, 1] = 1, from which the Proposition follows.

A similar argument to that above shows that if a, b ∈ R with a < b, where R has
the euclidean metric, then dimH [a, b] = 1. The next Corollary includes this result
and is an easy consequence of combining Proposition A4.1.24, Example A4.1.18,
Proposition A4.1.14, Proposition 4.3.5, and the definition of totally disconnected in
Exercises 5.2 #10.
A4.1.25

Corollary.

Let R denote the set of all real numbers with the

euclidean metric.
(i) dimH R = 1.
(ii) If S ⊂ R, then dimH S ⩽ 1.
(iii) If S contains a non-trivial interval (that is, is not totally disconnected), then

dimH S = 1.
(iv) If S is a non-trivial interval in R, then dimH S = 1.
Proof.

Remark.
In fact if Rn has the euclidean metric, with n ∈ N, then it is
true that dimH Rn = n. This is proved in Exercises A4.1 #15. However, the proof
there depends on the Generalized Heine-Borel Theorem 8.3.3 which is not proved

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

A5.0

Introduction

In this Appendix we give an introduction to the theory of topological groups, the
Pontryagin-van Kampen duality and structure theory of locally compact abelian
groups11 It assumes that the reader is familiar with the notion of group as is
included in an introductory course on group theory or usually in an introductory
course on abstract algebra12 .
We shall begin by Meandering Through a Century of Topological Groups.
This sets the stage for the study of topological groups, however the impatient
reader can move onto §A5.1.

Most of the material is this Appendix is taken from Morris [293].
A beautiful book on group theory is available as a free download. It is Macdonald [268].

In 1872 (Christian) Felix Klein, aged 23, was
appointed to a full Professorship at Erlangen in
Germany. In his first year as Professor he published
the ‘Erlangen Program13 ’.
In his 1925 obituary of Klein, Richard Courant14
wrote, this is “perhaps the most influential and
widely read paper in the second half of the
nineteenth century”.
In 1940 Julian Lowell Coolidge15 wrote that it

Klein

“probably influenced geometrical thinking more than
any other work since the time of Euclid, with the
exception of Gauss and Riemann”.
Klein was influenced by Julius Plücker (1801–
1868) and Rudolf Friedrich Alfred Clebsch(1833–
1872),

both

of

whom

had

made

significant

contributions to geometry.
Klein completed his PhD in 1868 at the age
of 19, shortly after his (first) PhD adviser, Julius
Plücker16 , died.

Plücker

After Plücker’s death, Klein came under the
influence of Rudolf Clebsch17 , who assisted Klein
obtain the Professorship at Erlangen.

[Clebsch

died in 1872 before the publication of the Erlangen
Program.]

When Clebsch died, most of his PhD
students moved to Erlangen and became students18
of Klein.

16 Plücker was a mathematical descendant of Carl Friedrich Gauss. Klein was also a mathematical
descendant of Leonhard Euler via his second PhD adviser Rudolf Otto Sigismund Lipschitz
17 Clebsch and Carl Neumann founded ‘Mathematische Annalen’ and Klein made it one of the best
mathematics journals.
18 Klein had a total of 57 PhD students and now has over 30,000 mathematical descendants
[including Karl Hofmann with whom I have coauthored books on compact groups and pro-Lie groups].

Amongst these students who transferred to Klein was Ferdinand Lindemann,
who in 1882 proved that π is a transcendental number; that is, π is not a root of
any polynomial with rational number coefficients.
It was known that if π were transcendental, then the 2,000 year old problem of
squaring the circle by compass and straightedge would be solved in the negative.
Three ancient problems,
(i) Delian problem – doubling the cube, i.e. constructing a cube of volume double
that of a given cube,
(ii) trisecting any given angle,
(iii) squaring the circle (or quadrature of the circle), that is constructing a square
whose area equals that of a given circle,
in each case using only a straight edge and compass , fascinated professional &
amateur mathematicians alike. (See Jones et al. [221].)

487

In 1775 the Paris Academy found it necessary to
pass a resolution that no more solutions of any of these
problems or of machines exhibiting perpetual motion
were to be examined.
Why did it take so long for these problems to be
solved?

Wantzel

It was because an understanding came not from
geometry but from abstract algebra (actually field
theory) a subject not born until the 19th century.
The first two problems were solved by Pierre Laurent
Wantzel (1814–1848) in 1837 and the third by Carl
Louis Ferdinand von Lindemann.

Lindemann

The field theory used in solving these ancient problems was also used by Robert
Henry Risch in the Risch Algorithm, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risch_algorithm,
in 1968 which transforms the problem of indefinite integration into a problem in
algebra.

The algorithm is partly implemented in the popular computer algebra
package Maple19 .
So we see abstract algebra played a vital role in solving geometry problems
dating back 2,000 years and played a key role in the progress of computer algebra.
Now we set the stage for the Erlangen Program of Felix Klein.
We have all met Euclidean geometry which has points, lines, angles, and a metric
(distance) and of course the famous Pythagoras theorem for right angled triangles
which says that the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the
squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
In Euclidean geometry every two points determine a line However two lines do
not necessarily determine a point: if they are not parallel, they do determine a point
(of intersection) but if they are parallel, they don’t determine a point. This is a little
disappointing.

19

See www.maplesoft.com.

488

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

But a greater disappointment comes from
art (or rather perspective :

if we have a two

dimensional picture/sketch/representation of a 3dimensional object, then distances, angles, &
parallel lines are not preserved. This can be easily
seen in the two pictures on the next page. (See
Credit for Images.)

Brunelleschi

In 1413 the Renaissance architect Filippo
Brunelleschi introduced the geometrical method
of perspective.

In 1435, italian author, artist,

architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and
cryptographer Leon Battista Alberti wrote Della
pittura, a treatise on how to represent distance
in painting.

He used classical optics to explain

perspective in art.

Alberti

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

The branch of geometry dealing with the properties of geometric figures that
remain invariant under projection is called projective geometry, and in earlier
literature – descriptive geometry.

A5.0.1

Definitions.

Let V be a vector space.

The projective space,

P (V ), is the set of one-dimensional vector subspaces of V .
If the vector space V has dimension n + 1, then P (V ) is said to be a projective
space of dimension n.
A one-dimensional projective space is called a projective line, and a twodimensional projective space is called a projective plane.
(See Examples 11.3.4 for a further discussion of the real projective plane and
real projective space.)

If V is the 3-dimensional vector space over the field R of real numbers, the
projective space P 2 (R) has as its “points” the 1-dimensional vector subspaces and
its “lines” are the 2-dimensional vector subspaces.
A “point” S is said to lie on a “line” L if the space S is contained in the space

L. Note that
(i) any two distinct “points” determine a unique “line”;
(ii) any two distinct “lines” determine a unique “point”.

• There are no parallel “lines".
• There is a duality between “points” & “lines”; theorems
remain true with “point” and “line” interchanged.

491

Using so-called homogeneous co-ordinates, we can represent points in the
projective plane as the set of all triples (u, v, w), except (0, 0, 0), where u, v, w ∈ R,
and for any c ∈ R \ {0}, the points (u, v, w) and (cu, cv, cw) are identified.


Of these points (u, v, w), those with w 6= 0 can be regarded as points

u v
,
w w



in the Euclidean plane, whereas the points (u, v, 0), can be thought of as points at
infinity.
So the projective plane can be thought of as consisting of the euclidean plane
plus points at infinity.
Formally this says, P 2 (R) = R2 ∪ P 1 (R).
We are now in a position to say a few words
about the Erlangen Program20 of Felix Klein.
In 1869, Klein went to Berlin and in his own
words “The most important event of my stay in
Berlin was certainly that, toward the end of October,
at a meeting of the Berlin Mathematical Society, I
made the acquaintance of the Norwegian, Sophus
Lie. Our work had led us from different points of
view finally to the same questions, or at least to
kindred ones. Thus it came about that we met every
day and kept up an animated exchange of ideas.”
“The E.P. itself..

was composed in October,

1872. . . Lie visited me for two months beginning
September 1. Lie, who on October 1 accompanied
me to Erlangen. . . had daily discussions with me

. . . entered eagerly into my idea of classifying
the different approaches to geometry on a grouptheoretic basis.”21

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

Klein suggested that not only euclidean geometry, but also the “new” nonEuclidean geometries, can be regarded as “sub-geometries” of projective geometry22
He also suggested each geometry can be characterized by the invariants of its
associated transformation group.
In euclidean geometry, figures F1 & F2 are “equal” if they are congruent; i.e.,

F2 is obtained from F1 by a rigid motion (translation, rotation, & reflection) of
euclidean space. So the transformation group associated with euclidean geometry
is the group consisting of the transformations corresponding to rigid motions.
Each geometry is similarly characterized by its symmetries using the group of
geometric transformations of a space each of which take any figure onto an “equal”
figure in that geometry.
The set of geometric transformations should have certain natural properties,
such as
(1) every figure F is ‘equal’ to itself;
(2) if a figure F1 is ‘equal’ to F2 , then F2 is ‘equal’ to F1 ; and
(3) if F1 is ‘equal’ to F2 and F2 is ‘equal’ to F3 , then F1 is ‘equal’ to F3 .
So we are led to insist that the set of transformations is in fact a group.

22

Klein proposed to mathematical physicists that even a moderate cultivation of the projective
purview might bring substantial benefits. A major success was when Klein’s colleague, Hermann
Minkowski (1864–1909), showed that the essence of Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity is captured
by the (spacetime) geometry of the Lorentz group. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group
for a discussion of the Lorentz group.)
Nobel Laureate Eugene Paul Wigner (1902–1995) advocated extending the Erlangen Program to
physics and demonstrated that symmetries expose the deepest secrets of physics. Quark
theory, (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark for a description of quarks.) and even the Higgs
boson particle (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson.) theory, are consequences of this
approach. See Amir D. Aczel, “It’s a Boson! The Higgs as the Latest Offspring of Math & Physics”,
http://tinyurl.com/bqaonns.

493

A5.0.2

Definitions.

A set, G, together with an operation · , such that for

all a, b ∈ G, a · b ∈ G, is said to be a group if
(i) (a · b) · c = a · (b · c), ∀a, b, c ∈ G;

[associativity]

(ii) there exists an element 1 in G, such that 1 · a = a · 1 = a, for every element

a ∈ G; The (unique) element 1 ∈ G with this property is said to be the
identity of the group.

a · b = b · a = 1.
The (unique) element b is called the inverse of a in G and is written a−1 .

(iii) for each a in G, there exists an element b in G such that

A group G is said to be an abelian group if a · b = b · a, for all a, b ∈ G.

A5.0.3

Examples.

We list some important examples:

(i) the group, R, of all real numbers with the operation of addition;
[Note that the set of real numbers with the operation of multiplication is not a
group as the element 0 has no inverse.]
(ii) the group, Q, of all rational numbers with the operation of addition;
We call Q a subgroup of R as Q ⊂ R and the group operation on Q is the
restriction of the group operation on R.
A subgroup N of a group G is called a normal subgroup if for all n ∈ N and
g ∈ G, gng −1 ∈ N .
(iii) the subgroup, Z, of R consisting of all integers;
(iv) the group, T, consisting of all complex numbers of modulus 1 (i.e. the set of
numbers e2πix , 0 ⩽ x < 1) with the group operation being multiplication of
complex numbers. Then T is called the circle group.
All of the above groups are abelian groups.



For a plethora of examples of nonabelian groups, we turn to groups of matrices.
Recall that an n × n matrix M in said to be nonsingular (or invertible) if there
is an n × n matrix M −1 such that M M −1 = M −1 M = I , where I is the n × n
identity matrix (with 1s on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere).

494

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

A5.0.4

Definition.

The multiplicative group of all nonsingular n × n

matrices with complex number entries is called the general linear group over

C and is denoted by GL(n, C).
GL(n, C) and its subgroups are called matrix groups.
As matrix multiplication is not commutative (i.e., M1 .M2 does not necessarily
equal M2 .M1 ), each GL(n, C) is a nonabelian group.

Definition.
The subgroup of GL(n, C) consisting of all matrices M
such that M.M t = M t .M = I (i.e., M −1 = M t ), where t denotes transpose, is

A5.0.5

called the orthogonal group and is denoted by O(n, C).

A5.0.6

Definition.

If G and H are groups, then G × H is a group with

the group operation being coordinatewise multiplication; i.e., if g1 , g2 ∈ G and

h1 , h2 ∈ H , then (g1 , h1 ) · (g2 , h2 ) = (g1 · g2 , h1 · h2 ), where · denotes the group
operation on G, H and G × H . The set G × H with this operation is called the
product group.

If I is any index set, the infinite product of groups Gi : i ∈ I ,

Q

Gi , is defined

i∈I
analogously.

A5.0.7

Definitions.

Let G and H be groups and f : G → H a map

(i) f is called a homomorphism if f (g1 · g2 ) = f (g1 ) · f (g2 ), for all g1 , g2 ∈ G.
(ii) If f is also surjective (i.e., f (G) = H ), then H is said to be a quotient
group of G, written H = G/N , where the kernel N = {g ∈ G : f (g) = 1}.
(iii) If f is bijective (i.e. injective [f (x) = f (y) ⇒ x = y ] and surjective), then f
is called an isomorphism.

495

Let G be a group with identity element 1, N a normal subgroup of G and H a
subgroup of G. The following statements are equivalent:
(i) G = N H and N ∩ H = {1}.
(ii) Every element of G can be written uniquely as a product of an element of N
and an element of H .
If one (= both) of these is true, then G is called a semidirect product of N and

H , written G = N oH .
Semidirect product is more general than product; if H is also a normal subgroup,
then N o H = N × H .
Pertinent to our earlier discussion are
(i) the projective group, PGL(n, R) which is defined as the quotient group
GL(n, R)/K, where the kernel, K , is {λIn : λ ∈ R} and In denotes the n × n
identity matrix; and
(ii) the euclidean group, E(2), of all rigid motions of the plane, R2 , is a
semidirect product of the abelian group R2 (which describes translations) and
the orthogonal group O(2, R) (which describes rotations and reflections which
fix the origin (0,0)).
Felix Klein focussed on “discontinuous” groups and Sophus Lie focussed on
“continuous” groups.

A5.0.8

Definition.

Let G be a group with a topology

τ . Then G is said to

be a topological group if the maps G → G given by g 7→ g −1 and G × G → G
given by (g1 , g2 ) 7→ g1 · g2 are continuous.

496

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

A5.0.9

Examples.

(i) Let G be any group with the discrete topology. Then

G is a topological group. In particular, if G is any finite group with the discrete
topology then G is a compact topological group.
(ii) R, T, Z, Q, Ra × Tb × Zc , for any non-negative integers a, b and c with the usual
topologies and the usual group operations are topological groups.
(iii) For each n ∈ N, the group GL(n, C) and all of its subgroups can be regarded as
2
subsets of Cn and so have subspace topologies and with these topologies they
are topological groups.
(iv) With the above topology, each O(n, C) is a compact group, which is Hausdorff23 .

A5.0.10

Definition.

Topological groups G and H are said to be

topologically isomorphic if there exists a mapping f : G → H such that f
is a homeomorphism and an isomorphism. This is written G ∼
= H.

A5.0.11

Definition.

A topological group is said to be a compact Lie

group if it is topologically isomorphic to a closed subgroup of an orthogonal
group, O(n), for some n ∈ N.

More generally, a Lie group is a group which
is also a differentiable manifold, with the property
that the group operations are compatible with the
smooth structure.

Recall that a topological group G is called locally euclidean if it has an open
set containing 1 which is homeomorphic to an open set containing 0 in Rn , n ∈ N.
Note that for topological groups
(i) compact ⇒ locally compact;
(ii) locally euclidean ⇒ locally compact;
(iii) Rn , n ∈ N, are not compact;
(iv) Ra ×Tb ×Zc , a,b,c nonnegative integers, and all Lie groups are locally euclidean.

cannot seriously undertake anything without them.) Here “Lie

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

At the International Congress of Mathematicians
in 1900, David Hilbert (862–1943) presented 23
problems that set the course for much of the
mathematical creativity of the 20th century.
Hilbert’s fifth problem asked whether (in later
terminology) a locally euclidean topological group is
in fact a Lie group.

It required half a century

of effort on the part of several generations of
eminent mathematicians until it was settled in
the affirmative.

Hilbert

The most influential book on the solution of Hilbert’s fifth problem and the
structure of locally compact groups was Montgomery and Zippin [288].
A recent presentation of this work, and winner of
the 2015 Prose Award for Best Mathematics Book,
is by the UCLA31 academic, Australian born Flinders
University32 graduate and 2006 Fields Medalist,
Terence Chi-Shen Tao [389]33 .
Tao points out striking applications: Gromov’s
celebrated theorem on groups of polynomial growth,
and to the classification of finite approximate groups
and to the geometry of manifolds.

For 5 years Per Enflo looked at extending
Hilbert’s Fifth Prolem to nonlocally compact groups
and he said this “turned out be be useful for
solving famous problems in Functional Analysis” – he
solved “the approximation problem’ and the “basis
problem” in Enflo [129] and the “invariant space
problem” in Enflo [128].
For problem 153 in the Scottish Problem Book,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Book,

which

was later recognized as being closely related to
Stefan Banach’s “basis problem", Stanisław Mazur
offered the prize of a live goose. This problem was
solved only in 1972 by Per Enflo, who was presented
with the live goose in a ceremony that was broadcast
throughout Poland.

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

At the beginning of the translation of the
Scottish Problem Book, http://tinyurl.com/jmrmuuh,
Stanisław Marcin Ulam writes:

“The enclosed

collection of mathematical problems has its origin in
a notebook which was started in Lwów, in Poland in
1935. If I remember correctly, it was S. Banach who
suggested keeping track of some of the problems
occupying the group of mathematicians there. The
mathematical life was very intense in Lwów. Some

Banach

of us met practically every day, informally in small
groups, at all times of the day to discuss .problems
of common interest, communicating to each other
the latest work and results.

Apart from the

more official meetings of the local sections of the
Mathematical Society (which took place Saturday
evenings, almost every week!), there were frequent
informal discussions mostly held in one of the coffee
houses located near the University building - one

Mazur

of them a coffee house named “Roma”, and the
other “The Scottish Coffee House". This explains
the name of the collection.

A large notebook

was purchased by Banach and deposited with the
headwaiter of the Scottish Coffee House, who, upon
demand, would bring it out of some secure hiding
place, leave it at the table, and after the guests
departed, return it to its secret location.
Many of the problems date from years before
1935, They were discussed a great deal among the
persons whose names are included in the text, and
then gradually inscribed into the book in ink.” . . .

Ulam

“As most readers will realize, the city of Lwów,
and with it the Scottish Book, was fated to have a
very stormy history within a few years of the book’s
inception. A few weeks after the outbreak of World
War II, the city was occupied by the Russians. From
items at the end of this collection, it will be seen that
some Russian mathematicians must have visited the
town; they left several problems (and prizes for their
solutions). The last date figuring in the book is May

Steinhaus

31, 1941. Item Number 193 contains a rather cryptic
set of numerical results, signed by (Władysław Hugo
Dionizy) Steinhaus, dealing with the distribution of
the number of matches in a box!

After the start

of war between Germany and Russia, the city was
occupied by German troops that same summer and
the inscriptions ceased.”

Partial solutions to Hilbert’s Fifth Problem

in 1923 Hermann Weyl

(1885–1955) and his student Fritz Peter laid the
foundations of the representation and structure

consequence, drawn by John von Neumann (1903–

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

Lev Semyonovich Pontryagin (1908–1988) and
Egbert Rudolf van Kampen (1908–1942) developed
in 1932, resp., 1936, the duality theory of locally

which flourished
throughout the second half of the 20th century.
Pontryagin
Pontryagin-van Kampen Duality34 provided the
central method for attacking the structure theory of
locally compact abelian groups. A positive response to
Hilbert’s question for locally euclidean abelian groups
van Kampen

followed in the wash.

A5.0.13

Definition.

If A is any abelian group, then the group Hom(A, T)

of all group homomorphisms of A into the circle group T (no continuity involved!)
given the subspace topology from the product space TA (of all maps of A into

b.
T) is called the dual group of A and is written A
As the dual group is clearly a closed subset of TA , we obtain:
A5.0.14

Proposition.

The dual group of any abelian group is an abelian

compact group.

A5.0.15

Definition.

If G is any abelian compact group, then the abelian

group (without topology) Hom(G, T) of all continuous homomorphisms of G
into T is called the dual group of the abelian compact group G and is written

Further there is a natural evaluation map from G into its second dual, namely

η : G → G

A5.0.17

Remark.

The above theorem implies that no information about G is

lost in going to the dual group. But the dual group is just an abelian group without
topology. From this we deduce the fact that every piece of information about G can
be expressed in terms of algebraic information about its dual group. So questions
about compact abelian groups are reduced to ones about abelian groups.
The next proposition provides some examples of this:
A5.0.18

Proposition.

Let G be an abelian compact group.

b;
(i) The weight, w(G), of G equals the cardinality of its dual group G
b is countable;
(ii) G is metrizable if and only if its dual group G
b is torsion-free (i.e., it has no
(iii) G is connected if and only if its dual group G
nontrivial finite subgroups);
b is divisible (i.e., if g ∈ Ĝ,
(iv) G is torsion-free if and only if its dual group G
then there is an hn ∈ Ĝ with (hn )n = g , for all positive integers n.)
The next theorem is quite surprising.
A5.0.19

Theorem.

If abelian connected compact groups G1 and G2 are

homeomorphic, then they are topologically isomorphic.

A topological group G is said to be a protorus if it is compact connected and
abelian.

So Theorem A5.0.19 can be restated: Two protori are topologically

isomorphic if and only if they are homeomorphic.

504

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

We now present the main structure theorem for locally compact abelian groups
which follows from Pontryagin van-Kampen Duality and answers Hilbert’s fifth
problem for locally compact abelian groups.
A5.0.20

Theorem.

Every connected locally compact abelian group is
topologically isomorphic to Rn × K , where K is a compact connected abelian
group and n is a nonnegative integer.
One

of

the

most

significant

papers

on

topological groups was published in 1949 by
Kenkichi Iwasawa (1917–1998), 3 years before
Hilbert’s Fifth Problem was finally settled by the
concerted contributions of Andrew Mattei Gleason
(1921–2008), Dean Montgomery (1909–1992),
Leon Zippin (1905–1995), and Hidehiko Yamabe
(1923–1960).

Iwasawa

Montgomery

It was Iwasawa who recognized for the first
time that the structure theory of locally compact
groups reduces to that of compact groups and
Lie groups provided one knew that they happen
to be approximated by Lie groups in the sense
of projective limits, in other words, if they were
pro-Lie groups. [See Hofmann and Morris [190].]

Zippin

Gleason

And this is what Yamabe established in 1953
for all locally compact groups G which are almost
connected (i.e., the quotient group of G by its
connected identity component is compact), e.g.
connected locally compact groups or compact
groups.

Yamabe

In 1976 the Council of the Australian Mathematical Society resolved to bring
a high calibre speaker from overseas for each Annual Meeting. The first of these
invited speakers, in 1977, was Karl Heinrich Hofmann35 .
35

Hofmann is a mathematical grandson of David Hilbert.

505

Hofmann was aware that in 1957 Richard
Kenneth Lashof (1922–2010) recognized that not
only Lie groups, but any locally compact group G
has a Lie algebra g. Hofmann believed that this
observation was the nucleus of a complete and rich,
although infinite dimensional, Lie theory which had

Lashof

never been exploited.
In his 1977 AustMS invited lecture
at La Trobe University, Hofmann made
a bold proposal, and that was to
extend Lie Theory from Lie groups
to a much wider class of topological
groups.
The first stage of this project
was to extend the Lie Theory to all
Compact Groups and this culminated
in the publication of the first edition of
the 800 page book, Karl H. Hofmann

Karl Hofmann & Sidney Morris at work

and Sidney A. Morris, “The Structure
of Compact Groups”, de Gruyter, 1998, with the 2nd edition in 2006, and the 3rd
900+ page edition, Hofmann and Morris [191], appearing in 2013. This book uses
Lie Theory to expose the structure of compact groups, thereby proving old and new
results by new methods.

506

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

In our book, Lie Theory is used to describe general compact groups in terms of
their building blocks:
(i) simple simply connected Lie groups
(which are known. For a discussion, see

http://tinyurl.com/hpqkjq2 in Wikipedia.
The classification of simple Lie groups
was done by Wilhelm Killing and Élie
Cartan.)

Killing

Cartan

(ii) compact connected abelian groups (which are understood from Pontryagin-van
Kampen Duality), and
(iii) profinite (⇔ compact totally disconnected) groups.
For each topological group G define the topological space L(G) = Hom(R, G)
of all continuous group homomorphisms from R to G, endowed with the topology
of uniform convergence on compact sets.
Define the continuous function exp : L(G) → G

exp X = X(1) and a
“scalar multiplication” (r, X) 7→ r.X : R × L(G) → L(G) by (r.X)(s) = X(sr).
by

This is useful when G is such that L(G) is a Lie algebra with addition and
bracket multiplication continuous. In Hofmann and Morris [191], it is shown that
this occurs for all compact groups.

507

Having

demonstrated

conclusively

the power of Lie Theory in the context
of compact groups, the second stage was
to apply it to locally compact groups.
However, the category of locally compact
groups is not a good one, as even infinite
products of locally compact groups are
not locally compact except in the trivial
case that they are almost all compact,
e.g, even Rℵ0 is not locally compact.
The

category

of

all

pro-Lie

groups

(and their continuous homomorphisms)

Hofmann and Morris, August 2016

is well-behaved and includes all compact groups, all Lie groups, and all connected
locally compact groups.
Pro-Lie groups are defined to be projective limits of Lie groups. Lie Theory was
successfully applied to this class and the structure of these groups was fully exposed
in the 600+ page book: Karl H. Hofmann and Sidney A. Morris, “The Lie Theory
of Connected Pro-Lie Groups”, European Mathematical Society Publ. House, 2007,
Hofmann and Morris [190].
Our next beautiful structure theorem describes the the structure of abelian
connected pro-Lie groups completely and the topology of connected pro-Lie groups.

Theorem.
Let G be a connected pro-Lie group. Then G is
homeomorphic to RJ × C , for some set J and maximal (connected) compact

A5.0.21

subgroup, C , of G. If G is abelian, then G is topologically isomorphic to RJ ×C .

The above theorem due to Karl H. Hofmann and Sidney A. Morris is a
generalization of the classical result for connected locally compact groups.

508

Theorem.

compact subgroup, C , of G. If G is abelian, then G is topologically isomorphic
to Rn × C .
We aim to describe the topology of compact groups in terms of simple simply
connected compact Lie groups, compact connected abelian groups, and profinite
groups.
Our next result is surprising.

This theorem tells us everything about the

topology of totally disconnected compact groups.

A5.0.23

Theorem.

The underlying topological space of every infinite

totally disconnected compact group is a Cantor cube.

This result is not trivial, but it can be proved by elementary means or by an
application of the structure theory of compact groups.
We shall see that the above theorem does much more than describe the topology
of a special class of compact groups.

A5.0.24

Definition.

If G is any topological group, then the largest

connected set containing 1 is said to be the identity component of G and
is denoted by G0 .
It is readily verified that for any topological group G, the identity component

G0 is a closed normal subgroup of G.
Further, if G is a compact group, then G0 is a compact group.
The following proposition is obvious.

A5.0.25

Proposition.

Let G be a topological group. Then the quotient

group G/G0 is a totally disconnected topological group.

Further, if G is a

compact group, then G/G0 is a totally disconnected compact group.

509

Now we state a powerful result which significantly reduces the task of describing
the topology of a general compact group.

A5.0.26

Theorem.

If G is any compact group then it is homeomorphic to

the product group G0 × G/G0 .
Theorem A5.0.26 and Theorem A5.0.23 together reduce the study of the
topology of compact groups to the study of the topology of connected compact
groups.

A5.0.27

Definition.

Let G be a topological group. Then G is said to

have no small subgroups or be an NSS-group if there exists an open set O
containing the identity and O contains no non-trivial subgroup of G.
For each positive integer n, the compact groups O(n), each discrete group, T,
R, and Ra × Tb × Zc , for non-negative integers a, b, c are NSS-groups.
A5.0.28

Theorem.

[Hilbert 5 for Compact Groups]

If G is a compact

group, then the following conditions are equivalent:
(i) G is a Lie group;
(ii) G is an NSS-group;
(iii) the topological space |G| is locally euclidean (that is, an open set
containing 1 in G is homeomorphic to an open set containing 0 in Rn ,
for some positive integer n).

Condition (iii) proves that compact Lie groups are characterized by just their
topology. This is a beautiful result.
The work of D. Montgomery, L. Zippin and A. Gleason in the 1950s characterized
noncompact Lie groups by conditions (ii) and (iii) above.
Earlier we reduced the study of the topology of compact groups to the study of
the topology of connected compact groups.

510

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

Next we reduce the study to that of the topology of
(a) abelian connected compact groups
and what we shall call
(b) semisimple groups.

A5.0.29

Definition.

Let g, h be elements of a group G. Then g −1 h−1 gh ∈

G is said to be a commutator and the smallest subgroup of G containing all
commutators is called the commutator subgroup and denoted by G0 .

A5.0.30

Theorem.

If G is any connected compact group, then G0 is

connected and
(i) every element of G0 is a commutator,
(ii) G0 is a compact group, and
(iii) G00 = G0 .

Condition (i) is remarkable; (ii) and (iii) are not valid without connectivity.

A5.0.31

Definition.
semisimple if G0 = G.

A5.0.32

Corollary.

A connected compact group G is said to be

to G0 × G/G0 .

If G is a connected compact group, it is homeomorphic

511

Corollary.
If G is any compact group then it is homeomorphic to
G/G0 × (G0 )0 × G0 /(G0 )0 , where G/G0 is homeomorphic to a Cantor cube.
A5.0.34

We now state the Sandwich Theorem for Semisimple Connected Compact
Groups. This tells us that each semisimple connected compact group is almost
a product of simple simply connected Lie groups.

A5.0.35

Theorem.

Let G be a semisimple connected compact group.

Then there is a family {Sj | j ∈ J} of simple simply connected compact Lie
groups and surjective continuous homomorphisms q and f

is the product of the quotient morphisms Sj → Sj /Z(Sj ).

A5.0.36

Remark.

In conclusion, then, we have that every compact group is

homeomorphic to the product of three groups whose topology we know: a compact
totally disconnected group (which is homeomorphic to a Cantor cube), a compact
connected abelian group, and a compact connected semisimple group.
Using Theorem A5.0.21 we then have that every connected pro-Lie group is also
homeomorphic to a product of three groups whose topology we know: RI for
some index set I , a compact connected abelian group, and a compact connected
semisimple group.
This completes our meandering through a century of study of topological groups.
Hopefully this overview of some of the highlights puts what follows in this appendix
into context. The next section begins our formal study of topological groups.

Topological Groups

A5.1.1

Definition.

Let (G,

τ ) be a set G, that is a group, with a topology

τ on G. Then (G, τ ) is said to be a topological group if
(i) the mapping (x, y) → xy of the product space (G, τ ) × (G, τ ) onto (G, τ )
is continuous, and
(ii) the mapping x → x−1 of (G,

τ ) onto (G, τ ) is continuous.

513

A5.1.2

Examples.

(1) The additive group of real numbers with the euclidean topology is a topological
group, usually denoted by R.
(2) The multiplicative group of positive real numbers with the induced topology
from R is also a topological group.
(3) The additive group of rational numbers with the euclidean topology is a
topological group denoted by Q.
(4) The additive group of integers with the discrete topology is a topological group
denoted by Z.
(5) Any group with the discrete topology is a topological group.
(6) Any group with the indiscrete topology is a topological group.
(7) The “circle" group consisting of the complex numbers of modulus one (i.e. the
set of numbers e2πix , 0 ⩽ x < 1) with the group operation being multiplication
of complex numbers and the topology induced from the euclidean topology on
the complex plane is a topological group. This topological group is denoted by
T (or S 1 ).
(8) Linear groups. Let A = (ajk ) be an n × n matrix, where the coefficients ajk
are complex numbers. The transpose t A of the matrix A is the matrix (akj ) and
the conjugate A of A is the matrix (ajk ), where ajk is the complex conjugate of
the number ajk . The matrix A is said to be orthogonal if A = A and t A = A−1
and unitary if A−1 = t (A).
The set of all non-singular n × n matrices (with complex number coefficients)
is called the general linear group (over the complex number field) and is
denoted by GL(n, C). The subgroup GL(n, C) consisting of those matrices
with determinant one is the special linear group (over the complex field) and
is denoted by SL(n, C). The unitary group U (n) and the orthogonal group

O(n) consist of all unitary matrices and all orthogonal matrices, respectively;
they are subgroups of GL(n, C). Finally we define the special unitary group
and the special orthogonal group as SU (n) = SL(n, C) ∩ U (n) and SO(n) =
SL(n, C) ∩ O(n), respectively.
2
The group GL(n, C) and all its subgroups can be regarded as subsets of Cn ,
2
where C denotes the complex number plane, and so Cn is a 2n2 -dimension
euclidean space. As such GL(n, C) and all its subgroups have induced topologies
and it is easily verified that, with these, they are topological groups.

Of course not every topology on a group makes it into a

topological group; i.e. the group structure and the topological structure need not be
compatible. If a topology
then

τ on a group G makes (G, τ ) into a topological group,

τ is said to be a group topology or a topological group topology.

A5.1.4

Example.

Let G be the additive group of integers. Define a topology

τ on G as follows: a subset U of G is open if either
(a) 0 6∈ U , or
(b) G\U is finite.
Clearly this is a (compact Hausdorff ) topology, but Proposition A5.1.5 below shows
that (G,

τ ) is not a topological group.

τ ) be a topological group. For each a ∈ G,
left and right translation by a are homeomorphisms of (G, τ ). Inversion is also

A5.1.5

Proposition.

Let (G,

a homeomorphism.

Proof.

The map La : (G,

τ ) → (G, τ ) given by g 7→ ag is the product of the two

continuous maps

(G, τ ) → (G, τ ) × (G, τ ) given by g 7→ (a, g), where g ∈ G, a is fixed, and
(G, τ ) × (G, τ ) → (G, τ ) given by (x, y) 7→ xy , x, y ∈ G,
and is therefore continuous. So left translation by any a ∈ G is continuous.
h Further,
i

La has a continuous inverse, namely La−1 , since La La−1 (g) = La a g =
a(a−1 g) = g and La−1 [La (g)] = La−1 [ag] = a−1 (ag) = g . So left translation is
a homeomorphism. Similarly right translation is a homeomorphism.
The map I : (G,

τ ) → (G, τ ) given by g 7→ g−1 is continuous, by definition.

Also I has a continuous inverse, namely I itself, as I[I(g)] = I[g −1 ] = [g −1 ]−1 = g .
So I is also a homeomorphism.



515

It is now clear that the (G,

τ ) in Example A5.1.4 above is not a topological

group as left translation by 1 takes the open set {−1} onto {0}, but {0} is not an
open set. What we are really saying is that any topological group is a homogeneous
space while the example is not. Homogeneous spaces are defined next.

A5.1.6

Definition.

A topological space (X,

τ ) is said to be homogeneous

if it has the property that for each ordered pair x, y of points of X , there exists
a homeomorphism f : (X,

τ ) → (X, τ ) such that f (x) = y.

While every topological group is a homogeneous topological space, we will see
shortly that not ever homogeneous space can be made into a topological group.
A5.1.7

Definition.

A topological space is said to be a T1 -space if each

point in the space is a closed set.
It is readily seen that any Hausdorff space is a T1 -space but that the converse
is false. See Exercises 4.1 #13.
We will see, however, that any topological group which is a T1 -space is
Hausdorff.

Incidentally, this is not true, in general, for homogeneous spaces–as

any infinite set with the cofinite topology is a homogeneous T1 space but is not
Hausdorff. As a consequence we will then have that not every homogeneous
space can be made into a topological group.

A5.1.8

Proposition.

Let (G,

τ ) be any topological group and e its

identity element. If U is any neighbourhood of e, then there exists an open
neighbourhood V of e such that
(i) V = V −1 (that is, V is a symmetric neighbourhood of the identity e)
(ii) V 2 ⊆ U .
(Here V −1 = {v −1 : v ∈ V } and V 2 = {v1 v2 : v1 ∈ V, v2 ∈ V }, not the set
{v 2 : v ∈ V }.)

Proof.

Exercise.

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

A5.1.9

Proposition.

Any topological group (G,

τ ) which is a T1-space is

also a Hausdorff space.

Proof.

Let x and y be distinct points of G. Then x−1 y 6= e. The set G \ {x−1 y}

is an open neighbourhood of e and so, by Proposition A5.1.8, there exists an open
symmetric neighbourhood V of e such that V 2 ⊆ G \ {x−1 y}. Thus x−1 y 6∈ V 2 .
Now xV and yV are open neighbourhoods of x and y , respectively. Suppose
xV ∩ yV 6= Ø. Then xv1 = yv2 , where v1 and v2 are in V ; that is, x−1 y = v1 v2−1 ∈
V.V −1 = V 2 , which is a contradiction. Hence xV ∩ yV = Ø and so (G, ) is

τ



Hausdorff.

A5.1.10

Remark.

So to check that a topological group is Hausdorff it is only

necessary to verify that each point is a closed set. Indeed, by Proposition A5.1.5, it
suffices to show that {e} is a closed set.
Warning. Many authors include “Hausdorff" in their definition of topological group.

A5.1.11

Remark.

The vast majority of work on topological groups deals only

with Hausdorff topological groups. (Indeed many authors include “Hausdorff" in their
definition of topological group.) We will see one reason for this shortly. However, it
is natural to ask: Does every group admit a Hausdorff topology which makes it into
a topological group? The answer is obviously “yes"–the discrete topology. But we
mention the following problem.
Question. Does every group admit a Hausdorff non-discrete group topology which
makes it into a topological group?
Shelah [359] provided a negative answer, under the assumption of the continuum
hypothesis.

However in the special case that the group is abelian (that is,

commutative) the answer is “yes" and we shall prove this soon.

subsets of G is partially-ordered by set inclusion ⊆. As the union of any
totally-ordered set of V -disjoint sets is a V -disjoint set, use Zorn’s Lemma

that {mV : m ∈ M } is a disjoint set of non-empty open sets in G. Verify
that in a separable space there is at most a countable number of disjoint
open sets and hence M is countable.

As M is maximal, show that for

A5.2.6

Corollary.

Let G be a topological group. Then

(i) {e} is a closed normal subgroup of G; indeed, it is the smallest closed
subgroup of G;
(ii) if g ∈ G, then {g} is the coset g{e} = {e}g ;
(iii) If G is Hausdorff then {e} = {e}.

Proof.

This follows immediately from Proposition A5.2.5 (ii) by noting that {e}

is a normal subgroup of G.

A5.2.7

Proposition.

Any open subgroup H of a topological group G is

(also) closed.

Proof.

G=

S

Let xi , i ∈ I be a set of right coset representatives of H in G. So

i∈I Hxi , where Hxi ∩ Hxj = Ø, for any distinct i and j in the index set I .

Since H is open, so is Hxi open, for each i ∈ I .
Of course for some i0 ∈ I , Hxi0 = H , that is, we have

G = H∪

S



i∈J Hxi , where J =

I\{i0 }.
These two terms are disjoint and the second term, being the union of open sets, is
open. So H is the complement (in G) of an open set, and is therefore closed in

G.
Note that the converse of Proposition A5.2.7 is false. For example, Z is a closed
subgroup of R, but it is not an open subgroup of R.

521

A5.2.8

Proposition.

Let H be a subgroup of a Hausdorff group G. If H

is locally compact, then H is closed in G. In particular this is the case if H is
discrete.

Proof.

Let K be a compact neighbourhood in H of e. Then there exists a

neighbourhood U in G of e such that U ∩ H = K . In particular, U ∩ H is closed in
G. Let V be a neighbourhood in G of e such that V 2 ⊆ U .
If x ∈ H , then as H is a group (Proposition A5.2.5), x−1 ∈ H . So there exists
an element y ∈ V x−1 ∩ H . We will show that yx ∈ H . As y ∈ H , this will imply
that x ∈ H and hence H is closed, as required.
To show that yx ∈ H we verify that yx is a limit point of U ∩ H . As U ∩ H is
closed this will imply that yx ∈ U ∩ H and so, in particular, yx ∈ H .
Let O be an arbitrary neighbourhood of yx. Then y −1 O is a neighbourhood
of x, and so y −1 O ∩ xV is a neighbourhood of x. As x ∈ H , there is an element
h ∈ (y −1 O ∩ xV ) ∩ H . So yh ∈ O. Also yh ∈ (V x−1 (xV ) = V 2 ⊆ U , and yh ∈ H ;
that is, yh ∈ O ∩ (U ∩ H). As O is arbitrary, this says that yx is a limit point of

U ∩ H , as required.

subgroup (of G) containing X .

(i) R is compactly generated by [0, 1] (or any other non-trivial compact interval).

Notation.

By LCA-group we shall mean locally compact Hausdorff abelian

topological group.

A5.2.15

Proposition.

The component of the identity (that is, the largest

connected subset containing e) of a topological group is a closed normal
subgroup.

Proof.

Let C be the component of the identity in a topological group G. As in

any topological space components are closed sets, C is closed.
Let a ∈ C . Then a−1 C ⊆ C , as a−1 C is connected (being a homeomorphic
image of C ) and contains e.
S −1
So
a C = C −1 C ⊆ C , which implies that C is a subgroup.
a∈C
To see that C is a normal subgroup, simply note that for each x in G, x−1 Cx is a
connected set containing e and so x−1 Cx ⊆ C .

A5.2.16

Proposition.

Let N be a normal subgroup of a topological group

G. If the quotient group G/N is given the quotient topology under the canonical
homomorphism p : G → G/N (that is, U is open in G/N if and only if p−1 (U )
is open in G), then G/N becomes a topological group. Further, the map p is
not only continuous but also open. (A map is said to be open if the image of
every open set is open.)

Proof.

The verification that G/N with the quotient topology is a topological

group is routine. That the map p is continuous is obvious (and true for all quotient
maps of topological spaces).
To see that p is an open map, let O be an open set in G. Then p−1 (p(O)) =

N O ⊆ G.
Since O is open, N O is open. (See Exercises A5.2 #4.) So by the definition of the
quotient topology on G/N , p(O) is open in G/N ; that is, p is an open map.

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

A5.2.17

Remarks.

(i) Note that quotient maps of topological spaces are not necessarily open maps.
(ii) Quotient maps of topological groups are not necessarily closed maps. For
example, if R2 denote the product group R × R with the usual topology,

2
and
o of R onto its first factor R, then the set S =
n p is the projection
x, x1 : x ∈ R, x 6= 0 is closed in R2 and p is a quotient map with p(S) not
closed in R.


A5.2.18

Proposition.

If G is a topological group and N is a compact

normal subgroup of G then the canonical homomorphism p : G → G/N is a
closed map. The homomorphism p is also an open map.

Proof.

If S is a closed subset of G, then p−1 (p(S)) = N S which is the product

in G of a compact set and a closed set. By Exercises A5.1 #4 then, this product
is a closed set. So p(S) is closed in G/N and p is a closed map. As p is a quotient
mapping, Proposition A5.2.16 implies that it is an open map.

Proposition.

If G is any topological group and C is the

The proof that G/C is totally disconnected is left as an exercise.

A5.2.21

Proposition.

If G/N is any quotient group of a locally compact

A5.2.22

Proposition.

Let G be a topological group and N a normal

subgroup. Then G/N is discrete if and only if N is open. Also G/N is Hausdorff
if and only if N is closed.

Proof.

This is obvious (noting that a T1 -group is Hausdorff ).

Exercises A5.2
1. Let G and H be topological groups and f : G → H a homomorphism. Show

(i) B1 and B2 , with the topologies determined by their norms, are topological

(ii) If T : B1 → B2 is a continuous homomorphism (of topological groups) then

T is a continuous linear transformation. (So if B1 and B2 are “isomorphic as
topological groups" then they are “isomorphic as topological vector spaces"

G, show that H lies in the centre, Z(G), of G (that is, gh = hg , for all g ∈ G

(This result is the usual reason given for studying Hausdorff topological
groups rather than arbitrary topological groups. However, the following
result which says in effect that all of the topology of a topological
group lies in its “Hausdorffization", namely G/{e}, is perhaps a better
reason.)

11. Show that every Hausdorff group, H , is topologically isomorphic to a closed

on each [ak , ak−1 ). Define a group structure on G by f g(t) = f (t)g(t) and
f −1 (t) = (f (t))−1 , where f and g ∈ G and t ∈ [0, 1). The identity of G is the
function identically equal to e in H . For ε > 0 and any neighbourhood V of e
in H let U (V, ε) be the set of all f such that λ({t ∈ [0, 1) : f (t) 6∈ V }) < ε,

topological groups each of which is a second countable space. By Exercises
A5.1 #6 and (i) and (iii) above, G is an ω -narrow topological group.
[It is proved in Theorem 3.4.23 of Arhangel’skii and Tkachenko [15] that a
topological group is ω -narrow if and only if it is topologically isomorphic to
a subgroup of a product of second countable topological groups.]
A class V of topological groups is said to be a variety of topological groups
if (i) every subgroup of a member of V is a member of V (ii) every quotient
group of a member of V is a member of V and (iii) every product of a set of
members of V is a member of V. (See Morris [295].) So we see that the class of

ω -narrow topological groups is a variety of topological groups. Other examples
are the class of all topological groups and the class of all abelian topological

is any homomorphism of H into a divisible abelian group D , then φ can be
extended to a homomorphism Φ of G into D .

By Zorn’s Lemma 10.2.16, it suffices to show that if x 6∈ H , φ can be
extended to the group H0 = {xn h : h ∈ H, n ∈ Z}.
Case (i). Assume xn 6∈ H , n ∈ N. Then define Φ(xn h) = φ(h), for all n ∈ Z.

Proof.

Clearly Φ is well-defined, a homomorphism, and extends φ on H .
Case (ii). Let k ⩾ 2 be the least positive integer n such that xn ∈ H . So
φ(xk ) = d ∈ D. As D is divisible, there is a z ∈ D such that z k = d. Define

Φ(xn h) = φ(h)z n , for all n ∈ Z. Clearly Φ is well-defined, a homomorphism and
extends φ on H .

Corollary.

If G is an abelian group, then for any g and h in G, with

g 6= h, there exists a homomorphism φ : G → T such that φ(g) 6= φ(h); that is,
φ separates points of G.

Clearly it suffices to show that for each g 6= e in G, there exists a

Proof.

homomorphism φ : G → T such that φ(g) 6= e.
Case (i). Assume g n = e, and g k 6= e for 0 < k < n. Let H = {g m : m ∈ Z}. Define

φ : H → T by φ(g) = an nth root of unity = r, say, (r 6= e), and φ(g m ) = rm , for
each m. Now extend φ to G by Proposition A5.3.6.
Case (ii). Assume g n 6= e, for all n > 0. Define φ(g) = z , for any z 6= e in T. Extend
φ to H and then, by Proposition A5.3.6, to G.
For later use we also record the following corollary of Proposition A5.3.6.

A5.3.8

Proposition.

Let H be an open divisible subgroup of an abelian

topological group G. Then G is topologically isomorphic to H × G/H . (Clearly

G/H is a discrete topological group.)

Proof.

Exercise.

A5.3.9

Theorem.

If G is any infinite abelian group, then G admits a

non-discrete Hausdorff group topology.

Proof.

Let {φi : i ∈ I} be the family of distinct homomorphisms of G into T.

Put H =

f (g) =

Ti , where each Ti = T. Define a map f : G → H =

φi (g). Since each φi is a homomorphism, f is also a homomorphism. By

i∈I
Corollary A5.3.7, f is also one-one; that is, G is isomorphic to the subgroup f (G)
of H .
As H is a Hausdorff topological group, f (G), with the topology induced from

H , is also a Hausdorff topological group. It only remains to show that f (G) is not
discrete.

532

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

Suppose f (G) is discrete.

Then, by Proposition A5.2.8, f (G) would be a

closed subgroup of H . But by Tychonoff ’s Theorem 10.3.4, H is compact and so

f (G)would be compact; that is, f (G) would be an infinite discrete compact space–
which is impossible. So we have a contradiction, and thus f (G) is not discrete.

Corollary A5.3.7 was essential to the proof of Theorem

A5.3.9. This Corollary is a special case of a more general theorem which will be
discussed later. We state the result below.

Proposition.

Every non-discrete subgroup G of R is dense.

We have to show that for each x ∈ R and each ε > 0, there exists an

element g ∈ G ∩ [x − ε, x + ε].
As G is not discrete, 0 is not an isolated point. So there exists an element

xε ∈ (G \ {0}) ∩ [0, ε]. Then the intervals [nxε , (n + 1)xε ], n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . cover R
and are of length ⩽ ε. So for some n, nxε ∈ [x−ε, x+ε] and of course nxε ∈ G.

Let G be a closed subgroup of R. Then G = {0},

G = R or G is a discrete group of the form aZ = {0, a, −a, 2a, −2a, . . . }, for
some a > 0.

Proof.

Assume G 6= R. As G is closed, and hence not dense in R, G must be

discrete. If G 6= {0}, then G contains some positive real number b. So [0, b] ∩ G is
a closed non-empty subset of the compact set [0, b]. Thus [0, b] ∩ G is compact and
discrete. Hence [0, b] ∩ G is finite, and so there exists a least element a > 0 in G.

Every proper Hausdorff quotient group of R is

topologically isomorphic to T.

Proof.

If R/G is a proper Hausdorff quotient group of R, then, by Proposition

A5.2.22, G is a closed subgroup of R. By Proposition A5.5.2, G is of the form aZ,
a > 0. Noting that the map x → a1 x is a topological group isomorphism of R onto
itself such that aZ maps to Z, we see that R/aZ is topologically isomorphic to R/Z
which, we know, is topologically isomorphic to T.

539

A5.5.6

Proof.

Corollary.

Every proper closed subgroup of T is finite.

Identify T with the quotient group R/Z and let p : R → R/Z be the

canonical quotient homomorphism. If G is any proper closed subgroup of R/Z then
p−1 (G) is a proper closed subgroup of R. So p−1 (G) is discrete. By Proposition
A5.2.16, the restriction p : p−1 (G) → G is an open map, so we see that G is discrete.
As G is also compact, it is finite.

We now proceed to the investigation of closed subgroups of Rn , for n ⩾ 1. Here
we use the fact that Rn is a vector space over the field of real numbers.
Notation. If A is a subset of Rn , we denote by sp R (A) the subgroup

{α1 a1 + · · · + αm am : αi ∈ R, ai ∈ A, i = 1, . . . , m, m a positive integer};
and by sp Q (A) the subgroup

{α1 a1 + · · · + αm am : αi ∈ Q, ai ∈ A, i = 1, . . . , m, m a positive integer};
and by gp (A) the subgroup of Rn generated by A.
Clearly gp (A) ⊆ sp Q (A) ⊆ sp R (A). We define rank (A) to be the dimension of
the vector space sp R (A).

A5.5.7 Proposition.
If {a1 , . . . , am } is a linearly independent subset of
Rn , then gp {a1 , . . . , am } is topologically isomorphic to Zm .

Choose elements am+1 , . . . , an so that {a1 , . . . , am , am+1 , . . . , an } is a
basis for Rn . It is clear that if {c1 , . . . , cn } is the canonical basis for Rn , then
gp {c1 , . . . , cm } is topologically isomorphic to Zm . By Exercises A5.5#2, every linear
transformation of Rn onto itself is a homeomorphism. So the linear map taking ai
to ci , i = 1, . . . , n, yields a topological group isomorphism of gp {a1 , . . . , am } onto
gp {c1 , . . . , cm } = Zm .
Proof.

As P is compact and G is discrete (and closed in Rn ), G ∩ P is discrete

Since G is of rank p, G ⊆ sp R {a1 , . . . , ap }, where a1 , . . . , ap are linearly

such {b1 , . . . , bp } there exists one with det(βij ) minimal. Let this set be denoted by
{b1 , . . . , bp }. We claim that G = gp {b1 , . . . , bp } and hence is topologically isomorphic

A5.5.11

Proposition.

Every non-discrete closed subgroup H of Rn , n ⩾ 1,

contains a line through zero.

Proof.

As H is non-discrete there exists a sequence h1 , h2 , . . . of points in H

converging to 0, with each hn 6= 0. Let C be an open cube with centre 0 containing
all the hn . Let mn denote the largest integer m > 0 such that mhn ∈ C . The
points mn hn , n = 1, 2, . . . lie in a compact set C and therefore have a cluster point

a ∈ C ∩ H.
If kmn hn − ak ⩽ ε we have k(mn + 1)hn − ak ⩽ ε + khn k, where k k denotes
the usual norm in Rn . Since hn → 0 as n → ∞ it follows that a is also a cluster
point of the sequence (mn + 1)hn , n = 1, 2, . . . , whose points belong to the closed
set Rn \ C . Hence a ∈ C ∩ (Rn \ C)–the boundary of C , which implies a 6= 0.
Let t be any real number. Since |tmn − [tmn ]| < 1, the relation kmn hn − ak ⩽ ε
implies that k[tmn ]hn − tak ⩽ |t|ε + khn k; since hn → 0 as n → ∞, ta is a limit
point of the sequence [tmn ]hn , n = 1, 2, . . . . But the points of this sequence belong
to H and so ta ∈ H , since H is closed. So H contains the line through a 6= 0 and

0.

543

Let G be a closed subgroup of Rn , n ⩾ 1. Then there
are (closed) vector subspaces U , V and W of Rn such that

A5.5.12

Theorem.

(i) Rn = U × V × W
(ii) G ∩ U = U
(iii) G ∩ V is discrete
(iv) G ∩ W = {0}
(v) G = (G ∩ U ) × (G ∩ V ).

Let U be the union of all lines through 0 lying entirely in G. We claim
that U is a vector subspace of Rn .

Proof.

To see this let x and y be in U and λ, µ and δ ∈ R. Then δλx is in U and hence
also in G. Similarly δµy ∈ G. So δ(λx + µy) = δλx + δµy ∈ G. As this is true for all
δ ∈ R, we have that λx + µy ∈ U . So U is a vector subspace of Rn , and G ∩ U = U .
Let U 0 be any complementary subspace of U ; that is, Rn = U × U 0 . So if g ∈ G,
then g = h + k , h ∈ U , k ∈ U 0 . As U ⊆ G, h ∈ G so k = g − h ∈ G. Hence

G = U × (G ∩ U 0 ).
Put V = sp R (G ∩ U 0 ) and W equal to a complementary subspace in U 0 of V .
So G ∩ W = {0}. Clearly G ∩ V contains no lines through 0, which by Proposition
A5.5.11, implies that G ∩ V is discrete.
A5.5.13

Theorem.

Let G be a closed subgroup of Rn , n ⩾ 1.

If r

equals the rank of G (that is, sp R (G) has dimension r ) then there exists a basis
a1 , . . . , an of Rn such that

G = sp R {a1 , . . . , ap } × gp {ap+1 , . . . , ar }.
So G is topologically isomorphic to Rp × Z r−p and the quotient group Rn /G is
topologically isomorphic to Tr−p × Rn−r .

Proof.

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

Before stating the next theorem let us record some facts about free abelian
groups.

A5.5.14

Definition.

A group F is said to be a free abelian group if it

is the restricted direct product of a finite or infinite number of infinite cyclic
groups. Each of these infinite cyclic groups has a single generator and the set

S of these generators is said to be a basis of F .

A5.5.15

Remarks.

(i) It can be shown that an abelian group F is a free abelian group with basis S if
and only if S is a subset of F with the property that every map f of S into any
abelian group G can be extended uniquely to a homomorphism of F into G.
(ii) One consequence of (i) is that any abelian group G is a quotient group of some
free abelian group. (Let F be the free abelian group with basis S of the same
cardinality as G. Then there is a bijection φ of S onto G. Extend this map to
a homomorphism of F onto G.)
(iii) Proposition A5.5.7 together with Theorem A5.5.10 show that any subgroup of
Zn is isomorphic to Zm , for some m. In other words, any subgroup of a free
abelian group with finite basis is a free abelian group with finite basis. It can
be shown that any subgroup of a free abelian group is a free abelian group. For
details see A.G. Kurosh [250].
(iv) Finally, we record that if the abelian group G admits a homomorphism φ onto
a free abelian group F then G is isomorphic to F × A, where A is the kernel of

φ. (Note that is suffices to produce a homomorphism θ of F into G such that
φθ is the identity map of F . To produce θ, let S be a basis of F and for each
s ∈ S choose a gs ∈ G such that φ(gs ) = s. As F is a free abelian group the
map s → gs of S into G can be extended to a homomorphism θ of F into G.
Clearly φθ acts identically on F .)

Theorem.

Let H = V × F , where V is a divisible abelian

Hausdorff group and F is a discrete free abelian group. If G is a closed subgroup
of H , then there exists a discrete free abelian subgroup F 0 of H isomorphic to

F such that (i) H = V × F 0 , and (ii) G = (G ∩ V ) × (G ∩ F 0 ).

Proof.

Let π1 : H → V and π2 : H → F be the projections. The restriction

of π2 to G is a homomorphism from G to F with kernel G ∩ V . Since F is a free
abelian group, and every subgroup of a free abelian group is a free abelian group,

G/(G∩V ) is free abelian, and therefore, by the above Remark (iv), G is algebraically
isomorphic to (G ∩ V ) × C , where C is a free abelian subgroup of G.
Let p1 and p2 be the restrictions of π1 and π2 to C , respectively. Then p2 is
one-one as C ∩ V = C ∩ G ∩ V = {0}.

V
We can define a homomorphism θ : p2 (C) → V by putting θ(p2 (c)) = p1 (c)
and then use Proposition A5.3.6 to extend θ to a homomorphism of F into the
divisible group V . So θp2 = p1 . If we now define a homomorphism φ : F → H by
φ(x) = θ(x) + x and put F 0 = φ(F ) we have that H = V × F 0 , algebraically; the
decomposition being given by

v + f = [v − θ(f )] + [θ(f ) + f ], v ∈ V and f ∈ F.
Also C ⊆ F 0 , since for each c in C we have

c = p1 (c) + p2 (c) = θ(p2 (c)) + p2 (c) = φ(p2 (c)) ∈ φ(F ) = F 0 .
So (i) and (ii) are satisfied algebraically.
Now φ : F → F 0 is an algebraic isomorphism and since φ−1 is induced by π2 ,
φ−1 is continuous. But F is discrete, so φ is a homeomorphism and F 0 is a discrete
free abelian group.

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

To show that H has the product topology with respect to the decomposition
H = V × F 0 , it suffices to show that the corresponding projections π10 : H → V
and π20 : H → F 0 are continuous. But this is clearly the case since π10 (h) =
π1 (h) − θ(π2 (h)) and π20 (h) = π2 (h) + θ(π2 (h)), for each h ∈ H . Hence the
decomposition G = (G ∩ V ) × (G ∩ F 0 ) also has the product topology.

In Corollary A5.5.18 we have not said that a ⩽ n, b ⩽ m

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

Theorem.
Let G be a Hausdorff abelian topological group locally
isomorphic to Rn , n ⩾ 1. Then G is topologically isomorphic to Ra × Tb × D ,

A5.5.25

where D is a discrete group and a + b = n.

By Lemma A5.5.24 there is a continuous homomorphism f of Rn onto
an open subgroup H of G. As G is locally isomorphic to Rn , it has a compact
Proof.

neighbourhood of 0 and so is locally compact. Hence H is locally compact and the
Open Mapping Theorem A5.4.4 says that f is an open map; that is, H is a quotient
group of Rn . Further the kernel K of f is discrete since otherwise there would be
elements x 6= 0 of K arbitrarily close to 0 such that f (x) = 0, which is false as f
maps a neighbourhood of 0 homeomorphically into G. So Theorem A5.5.13 tells us
that H is topologically isomorphic to Ra × Tb , with a + b = n.
Now H is an open divisible subgroup of G which, by Proposition A5.3.8, implies
that G is topologically isomorphic to H × D , where D = G/H is discrete. Thus G
is topologically isomorphic to Ra × Tb × D , as required.
The next corollary follows immediately.

A5.5.26 Corollary.
Any connected topological group locally isomorphic to
Rn , n ⩾ 1, is topologically isomorphic to Ra × Tb , where a + b = n.

Remark.

We conclude this section by noting that some of the results

presented here can be extended from finite to infinite products of copies of R. For

example, it is known that any closed subgroup of a countable product
Ri of
i=1
isomorphic copies Ri of R is topologically isomorphic to a countable product of
isomorphic copies of R and Z. However, this result does not extend to uncountable
products. For details of the countable products case, Brown et al. [60] and Leptin
[258]. The uncountable case is best considered in the context of pro-Lie groups,

Uniform Spaces

We now say a few words about uniform spaces just enough for our purposes here.
For further discussion, see Kelley [233] and Bourbaki [51].
We introduce some notation convenient for this discussion.
Let X be a set and X × X = X 2 the product of X with itself. If V is a subset of

X 2 then V −1 denotes the set {(y, x) : (x, y) ∈ V } ⊆ X 2 . If U and V are subsets of
X 2 then U V denotes the set of all pairs (x, z), such that for some y ∈ X , (x, y) ∈ U
and (y, z) ∈ V . Putting V = U defines U 2 . The set {(x, x) : x ∈ X} is called the
diagonal.

551

A5.6.1

A uniformity on a set X is a non-empty set U of

Definitions.

subsets of X × X such that
(a) Each member of U contains the diagonal;
(b) U ∈ U =⇒ U −1 ∈ U ;
(c) if U ∈ U then there is a V ∈ U such that V 2 ⊆ U ;
(d) if U ∈ U and V ∈ U , then U ∩ V ∈ U ;
(e) if U ∈ U and U ⊆ V ⊆ X 2 , then V ∈ U .
The pair (X, U) is called a uniform space and each member of U is called an
entourage.
A5.6.2

Examples.

If R is the set of real numbers, then the usual uniformity

on R is the set U of all subsets of U of R × R such that {(x, y) : |x − y| < r} ⊆ U ,
for some positive real number r .
Indeed if (X, d) is any metric space then we can define a uniformity U on

X by putting U equal to the collection of all subsets U of X × X such that
{(x, y) : d(x, y) < r} ⊆ U , for some positive real number r.
Let (G,

τ ) be a topological group and for each neighbourhood U of e, let

UL = {(x, y) : x−1 y ∈ U } and UR = {(x, y) : xy −1 ∈ U }. Then the left uniformity
L on G consists of all sets V ⊆ G × G such that UL ⊆ V , for some U . Similarly we
define the right uniformity. The two-sided uniformity consists of all sets W such
that UL ⊆ W or UR ⊆ W , for some U .
A5.6.3

Remarks.

Given any uniformity U on a set X we can define a

corresponding topology on X . For each x ∈ X , let Ux = {y ∈ X : (x, y) ∈ U }.
Then as U runs over U , the system Ux defines a base of neighbourhoods at x for
a topology; that is, a subset T of X is open in the topology if and only if for each

x ∈ T there is a U ∈ U such that Ux ⊆ T .
It is easily verified that if (G,

τ ) is a topological group then the topologies

arising from the left uniformity, the right uniformity and the two-sided
uniformity all agree with the given topology.

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

A5.6.4

Definitions.

Let (E,

τ E ) and (F, τ F ) be topological spaces and

M any set of subsets M of E and {Vi : i ∈ I}, for some index set I , a base of
open sets for the topology τ F on F . Let P (M, Vi ) = {f : f ∈ F E and f (M ) ⊆
Vi } .
(F E denotes the set of all functions f : E → F .)
The family {P (M, Vi ) : M ∈ M, I ∈ I}, is a subbase for a topology on F E .
[If F is a Hausdorff space and M is a covering of E then it is easily verified that
this topology is Hausdorff.]
Two important special cases of this topology are when
(a) M is the collection of all finite subsets of E – the topology is then the

p-topology or the topology of pointwise convergence, and
(b) M is the collection of all compact subsets of E – the k-topology or the
compact-open topology.

Since every finite set is compact, p ⊆ k . Therefore a subset of F E which is

k -compact is also p-compact, but the converse if false.
Observe that F E with the p-topology is simply

Q

Fx , with the product

x∈E
topology, where each Fx is a homeomorphic copy of F .
We are interested in C(E, F ), the subset of F E consisting of all continuous
functions from E to F , and we shall want to find conditions which guarantee that
a subset of C(E, F ) is k -compact.

Each topology

τ on G ⊆ F E which is jointly

continuous is finer than the k -topology.

Proof.

Let U be an open set in (F,

τ F ), (K, τ K ) a compact subspace of (E, τ E ),

and θ the map taking (g, x) to g(x), g ∈ G and x ∈ E . We want to show that for
each f ∈ P (K, U ) = {g : g ∈ G and g(K) ⊆ U } there is a set W ∈

τ such that

f ∈ W ⊆ P (K, U ).
= (G × K) ∩ θ−1 (U ) is open in
(G, τ ), ×(K, τ K ). If f ∈ P (K, U ), then {f } × K ⊆ V and since {f } × K is
compact, there is a W ∈ τ such that f ∈ W and W × K ⊆ θ −1 (U ). Hence
W ⊆ P (K, U ) as required.

Proposition.

Let (E,

G ⊆ C(E, F ). Then G is k -compact, that is compact in the k topology, if
(a) G is k -closed in C(E, F ),
(b) the closure of the set {g(x) : g ∈ G} is compact in (F,

τ F ), for each x ∈ E ,

and
(c) the p-topology for the p-closure of G in F E is jointly continuous.

Proof.

Let G be the p-closure in F E of G. By condition (b),

Q

({g(x) : g ∈ G})

x∈E
is a p-compact set, and since G is a p-closed subset of this set, G is p-compact.
By condition (c), the p-topology on G is jointly continuous – so G ⊆ C(E, F ).
Also by Proposition A5.6.6, the p-topology on G is finer than the k -topology and
hence they coincide. Thus G is k -compact. As G is k -closed in C(E, F ) and G is

k -compact and a subset of C(E, F ), we have that G is k -compact.

Let E be a topological space and F a uniform space.

A subset G of C(E, F ) is said to be equicontinuous at the point x ∈ E if
for each U in the uniformity U of F , there exists a neighbourhood V of x such
that (g(y), g(x)) ∈ U , for all y ∈ V and g ∈ G. The family G is said to be
equicontinuous if it is equicontinuous at every x ∈ E .

A5.7

Dual Groups

We are now ready to begin our study of duality.

A5.7.1

Definitions.

If G is an abelian topological group then a continuous

homomorphism γ : G → T is said to be a character. The collection of all
characters is called the character group or dual group of G, and is denoted
by G∗ or Γ.
Observe that G∗ is an abelian group if for each γ1 and γ2 in G∗ we define

(γ1 + γ2 )(g) = γ1 (g) + γ2 (g), for all g ∈ G.
Instead of writing γ(g), γ ∈ Γ and g ∈ G we shall generally write (g, γ).
A5.7.2

Example.

Consider the group Z. Each character γ of Z is determined

by γ(1), as γ(n) = nγ(1), for each n ∈ Z. Of course γ(1) can be any element of

T. For each a ∈ T, let γa denote the character γ of Z with γ(1) = a. Then the
mapping a → γa is clearly an algebraic isomorphism of T onto the character group
of Z. So the dual group Z∗ of Z is algebraically isomorphic to T.


557

A5.7.3

Examples.

(i) Consider the group T. We claim that every character γ of T can be expressed in
the form γ(x) = mx, where m is an integer characterizing the homomorphism

γ.
To see this let K denote the kernel of γ . Then by Corollary A5.5.6, K = T or K
is a finite cyclic group. If K = T, then γ is the trivial character and γ(x) = 0.x,

x ∈ T. If K is a finite cyclic group of order r then, by Corollart A5.5.5, T/K is
topologically isomorphic to T. Indeed, if p is the canonical map of T onto T/K
then the topological isomorphism θ : T/K → T is such that θp(x) = rx. Let α
be the continuous one-one homomorphism of T into T induced by γ .

(ii) Consider the group R. We claim that every character γ of R can be expressed
in the form γ(x) = exp(2πidx), x ∈ R, where d is a fixed real number defining

γ : γ = γd . Further, we have γa + γb = γa+b . Thus the dual group of R is
algebraically isomorphic to R itself, under the isomorphism d → γd .
To prove the claim, let K denote the kernel of γ . If K = R then γ = γ0 . If

K 6= R then Proposition A5.5.2 says that K is isomorphic to Z. Further by
Corollary A5.5.5 the quotient group R/K is topologically isomorphic to T. As
in (i) above there are only two possibilities for the induced algebraic isomorphism

R/K → T; these give rise to the cases γ = γ1/a and γ = γ(−1/a) , where a is
the least element of K . So every γ is of the form γd for some d ∈ R, and hence
R is algebraically isomorphic to its dual group.
Exercises A5.7 #1 implies that α(x) = x, for all x ∈ T, or α(x) = −x, for all x ∈ T.
So γ(x) = rx or −rx, for each x ∈ T.

558

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

Hence each character γ of T is of the form γ = γm for some m ∈ Z, where
γm (x) = mx for all x ∈ T. Of course γm + γn = γm+n . Thus the dual group T∗ of
T is algebraically isomorphic to Z, with the isomorphism being m → γm .

group.

Proof.

A5.7.6

Theorem.

If G is any LCA-group then G∗ , endowed with the

k -topology, is an LCA-group.

Proof.

To show that G∗ , with the k -topology, is locally compact, let U be any

compact neighbourhood of 0 in G and Va = {t : t = exp(2πix) ∈ T and 1 > x >
1 − a or a > x ⩾ 0}, where a is a positive real number less than 41 . Then Va is an
open neighbourhood of 0 in T.
Let Na = P (U, Va ) = {γ ∈ G∗ : (g, γ) ∈ Va , for each g ∈ U }. By the definition
of the k -topology, Na is a neighbourhood of 0 in G∗ . we shall show that the k -closure
of Na , clk (Na ), is k -compact. To do this we use Ascoli’s Theorem A5.6.11.
Firstly, we show that Na is equicontinuous. Let ε > 0 be given. We wish to
show that there exists a neighbourhood U1 of 0 in G such that for all γ ∈ Na and

g , h, and g − h in U1 , (g − h, γ) = (g, γ) − (h, γ) ∈ Vε , where
Vε = {t : t = exp(2πix) ∈ T and 1 > x > 1 − ε or ε > x ⩾ 0}.
Suppose that there is no such U1 . Without loss of generality assume ε < 41 and
let n be a positive integer such that 21 > nε > a. Further, let W be a neighbourhood
of 0 in G such that
n
X
Wi ⊆ U, where each Wi = W.
(1)
i=1
By assumption, then, for some g and h in W with g − h ∈ W and some

γ ∈ Na , (g − h, γ) 6∈ Vε . So without loss of generality (g − h, γ) = exp(2πix)
with a > x ⩾ ε. Let j be a positive integer less than or equal to n such that
1
2 > jx > a. So (j(g − h), γ) 6∈ Va . But as jg , jh and j(g − h) all belong to U , by
(1), (j(g − h), γ) ∈ Va , which is a contradiction. Hence Na is equicontinuous.
By Proposiition A5.6.9 the p-closure of Na is equicontinuous. As any subset of
an equicontinuous set is equicontinuous, and clk (Na ) is a subset of the p-closure of

Na , we have that clk (Na ) is equicontinuous.
As T is compact, condition (b) of Ascoli’s Theorem A5.6.11 is also satisfied
and hence clk (Na ) is a compact neighbourhood of 0. So G∗ with the k -topology is
locally compact.

number a < 41 , Va = {t : t = exp(2πix) ∈ T with 1 > x > 1 − a or a > x ⩾ 0}.
Then P (K, Va ) is a compact neighbourhood of 0 in Γ.

Notation.

From now on G∗ and Γ will denote the dual group of G

with the k -topology.

A5.7.9

Theorem.

Let G be an LCA-group and Γ its dual group. If G is

compact, then Γ is discrete. If G is discrete, then Γ is compact.

Proof.

Let G be compact and Va be as in Corollary A5.7.7 Then P (G, Va ) is a

neighbourhood of 0 in Γ. As Va contains no subgroup other than {0}, we must have

P (G, Va ) = {0}. So Γ has the discrete topology.
Let G be discrete. Then by Corollary A5.7.7, P ({0}, Va ) is a compact subset of

Γ. But P ({0}, Va ) clearly equals Γ, and hence Γ is compact.

Corollary.

The dual group T∗ of T is topologically isomorphic to

Z.

Pontryagin–van Kampen Duality Theorem: Introduction

We begin with a statement of the duality theorem.
Theorem. [Pontryagin-van Kampen Duality Theorem] Let G be an LCAgroup and Γ its dual group. For fixed g ∈ G, let g 0 : Γ → T be the function
given by g 0 (γ) = γ(g), for all γ ∈ Γ. If α : G → Γ∗ is the mapping given by
α(g) = g 0 , then α is a topological group isomorphism of G onto Γ∗ .
A5.8.1

Remarks.

(i) Roughly speaking this says that every LCA-group is the dual group of its dual
group.
(ii) This theorem says that every piece of information about an LCA-group
is contained in some piece of information about its dual group.

In

particular all information about a compact Hausdorff abelian group is contained
in information about its dual group – a discrete abelian group. So any compact
Hausdorff abelian group can be completely described by the purely algebraic
properties of its dual group; for example, if G is a compact Hausdorff abelian
group then we shall see that
(a) G is metrizable if and only if Γ is countable.
(b) G is connected if and only if Γ is torsion-free.

563

In the notation of the above Theorem, α is a continuous
homomorphism of G into Γ∗ .

A5.8.2

Proof.

Lemma.

Firstly we have to show that α(g) ∈ Γ∗ ; that is, α(g) = g 0 is a continuous

homomorphism of Γ into T.
As α(g)(γ1 + γ2 ) = (γ1 + γ2 )(g) = γ1 (g) + γ2 (g) = α(g)(γ1 ) + α(g)(γ2 ), for each

γ1 and γ2 in Γ, α(g) : Γ → T is a homomorphism.
To see that α(g) is continuous, it suffices to note that α(g)(γ) ∈ Vε whenever

γ ∈ P ({g}, Vε ), where Vε is an ε-neighbourhood of 0 in T as in Theorem A5.7.6.
So α is a map of G into Γ∗ .
That α is a homomorphism follows by observing

α(g1 + g2 )(γ) = γ(g1 + g2 ) = γ(g1 ) + γ(g2 ) = α(g1 )(γ) + α(g2 )(γ), for all γ ∈ Γ,
=⇒ α(g1 + g2 ) = α(g1 ) + α(g2 ), for all g1 , g2 ∈ G.
To show that α is continuous, it suffices to verify continuity at 0 ∈ G. Let
W be any neighbourhood of 0 in Γ∗ . Without loss of generality we can assume

W = P (K, Vε ), for some compact subset K of Γ. We have to find a neighbourhood
of 0 in G which maps into W .
Let U be any open neighbourhood
of 0 in G such thatnU is compact
and

all g ∈ U1 and i = 1, . . . , m. (This is possible since the γi are continuous.) We
claim that U1 is the required neighbourhood.
 To see
 this let g ∈ U1 and consider
α(g)(γ), where γ ∈ K . Then γ ∈ γi + P U , Vε/2 , for some i ∈ {1, . . . , m}. So



γ − γi ∈ P U , Vε/2 . Thus (γ − γi )(g) ∈ Vε/2 for g ∈ U1 ⊆ U . As γi (g) ∈ Vε/2 ,
this implies that γ(g) ∈ Vε/2 + Vε/2 ⊆ Vε . So α(g)(γ) ∈ Vε , as required.

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

The duality theorem will be proved for compact groups and discrete groups first,
and then it will extended to all LCA-groups.
There are a number of proofs of the duality theorem in the literature. The proof
presented in this Appendix is from Morris [293]. An elegant proof appears in Rudin
[353]. Hewitt and Ross [180] present the more classical approach of first deriving
the structure theory of LCA-groups and then using it in the proof of duality. A proof
using category theory is given in Roeder [343]. Other references include Weil [421],
Cartan and Godement [71], Raikov [335], Naimark [306], Dikranjan et al. [108] and
of course, Pontryagin [330].

Exercises A5.8
1. Show that Z satisfies the Pontryagin-van Kampen Duality Theorem.
(Note. This requires more than just showing that Z∗∗ is topologically isomorphic
to Z. You must prove that the map α in the duality theorem is a topological
group isomorphism.)

Dual Groups of Subgroups, Quotients, and Finite Products

Wenow make some observations which are needed in the proof of the duality theorem,
but which are also of interest in themselves.

If G1 , . . . , Gn are LCA-groups with dual groups
Γ1 , . . . , Γn , respectively, then Γ = Γ1 × Γ2 × · · · × Γn is the dual group of
A5.9.1

Theorem.

G1 × G2 × · · · × Gn .

Proof.

It suffices to prove this for the case n = 2, and finite products can then

be easily deduced by mathematical induction.
If g = g1 + g2 is the unique representation of g ∈ G as a sum of elements of

G1 and G2 , then the pair γ1 ∈ Γ1 and γ2 ∈ Γ2 determine a character γ ∈ Γ by the
formula

(g, γ) = (g1 , γ1 ) + (g2 , γ2 )

(1)

Since every γ ∈ Γ is completely determine by its action on the subgroups G1
and G2 , equation (1) shows that Γ is algebraically the direct sum of Γ1 and Γ2 .
To see that Γ has the product topology Γ1 × Γ2 simply note that

Theorem A5.9.1 shows that the dual group of a finite product is the product of
the dual groups. We shall see, in due course, that the dual of a closed subgroup is
a quotient group, and the dual of a quotient group is a closed subgroup. As a first
step towards this we have Proposition A5.9.5.

The verification that f ∗ is a homomorphism of B ∗ into A∗ is routine. To
see that f ∗ is continuous, let P (K, U ) be a subbasic open set in A∗ , where U is an

Proof.

open subset of T and K is a compact subset of A. The continuity of f ∗ follows
from the fact that (f ∗ )−1 (P (K, U )) = P (f (K), U ) is an open subset of B ∗ .
Assume f is onto and suppose that f ∗ (γ1 ) = f ∗ (γ2 ) where γ1 and γ2 are in B ∗ .
Then f ∗ (γ1 )(a) = f ∗ (γ2 )(a), for all a ∈ A; that is, γ1 f (a) = γ2 f (a), for all a ∈ A.
As f is onto this says that γ1 (b) = γ2 (b), for all b ∈ B . Hence γ1 = γ2 and f ∗ is
one-one.
Assume that f is both an open mapping and one-one. Let δ ∈ A∗ . As f is
one-one, Proposition A5.3.6 tells us that there is a (not necessarily continuous)
homomorphism γ : B → T such that δ = γf . As δ is continuous and f is an open
mapping, γ is indeed continuous; that is, γ ∈ B ∗ . As f ∗ (γ) = δ , we have that f ∗ is
onto.

A5.9.6

If B is a quotient group of A, where A and B are either

both compact Hausdorff abelian groups or both discrete abelian groups, then
B ∗ is topologically isomorphic to a subgroup of A∗ .

If A is a subgroup of B , where A and B are discrete

A5.9.8

Remark.

As noted earlier we shall see in due course that Corollary

A5.9.6 and Corollary A5.9.7 remain true if the hypotheses “compact Hausdorff" and
“discrete" are replaced by “locally compact Hausdorff". We also mention that the
analogous results for duality in Banach spaces appears in Exercises 10.3 #33(xvi).
The next lemma indicates that, before proving the Pontryagin-van Kampen
Duality Theorem, we shall have to see that LCA-groups have enough characters to
separate points.

A5.9.9

Lemma.

In the notation of the Pontryagin-van Kampen Duality

Theorem, the map α is one-one if and only if G has enough characters to
separate points; that is, for each g and h in G, with g 6= h, there is a γ ∈ Γ
such that γ(g) 6= γ(h).

Proof.

Assume that α is one-one. Suppose that there exist g and h in G, with

g 6= h, such that γ(g) = γ(h) for all γ ∈ Γ. Then α(g)(γ) = α(h)(γ), for all γ ∈ Γ.
So α(g) = α(h), which implies that g = h, a contradiction. Hence G has enough
characters to separate points.
Assume now that G has enough characters to separate points. Let g and h be in

G, with g 6= h. Then there is a γ ∈ Γ such that γ(g) 6= γ(h). So α(g)(γ) 6= α(h)(γ),
which implies that α(g) 6= α(h). So α is one-one.

569

The final proposition in this section should remind some readers of the StoneWeierstrass Theorem.

A5.9.10

Proposition.

Let G be an LCA-group and Γ its dual group.

Let G satisfy the Pontryagin-van Kampen Duality Theorem and also have the
property that every nontrivial Hausdorff quotient group Γ/B of Γ has a nontrivial
character. If A is a subgroup of Γ which separates points of G, then A is dense
in Γ.

Proof.

Suppose A is not dense in Γ. If B is the closure of A in Γ then Γ/B

is a nontrivial LCA-group. So there exists a nontrivial continuous homomorphism

φ : Γ/B → T.
Let f be the canonical homomorphism : Γ → Γ/B . Then φf is a continuous
homomorphism : Γ → T. Furthermore, φf (Γ) 6= 0 but φf (B) = 0.
As G satisfies the Pontryagin-van Kampen Duality Theorem, there is a g ∈ G
such that φf (γ) = γ(g), for all γ ∈ Γ. So γ(g) = 0 for all γ in A. But since A
separates points in G, this implies g = 0. So φf (Γ) = 0, which is a contradiction.
Hence A is dense in Γ.
Of course the second sentence in the statement of Proposition A5.9.10 will, in
due course, be seen to be redundant.

Peter-Weyl Theorem

In Lemma A5.9.9 we saw that a necessary condition for a topological group to
satisfy duality is that it have enough characters to separate points. That discrete
abelian groups have this property has been indicated already in Corollary A5.3.7.
For compact groups we use a result from the representation theory of topological
groups.

The following theorem is named after Hermann Weyl (1885–1955) and his

[422] in 1927 for compact Lie groups and by the Dutch mathematician Egbert
Rudolf van Kampen (1908–1942)extended it to all compact groups in van Kampen
[397] in 1935 using the 1934 work, von Neumann [411], of the Hungarian-American
mathematician John von Neumann (1903–1957) on almost periodic functions.

The Duality Theorem for Compact
Groups and Discrete Groups

The next proposition provides the last piece of information we need in order to
prove the Pontryagin-van Kampen Duality Theorem for compact groups and discrete
groups. (This proposition should be compared with Proposition A5.9.10.)

A5.11.1

Proposition.

Let G be a discrete abelian group and Γ its dual

group. If A is a subgroup of Γ which separates points of G, then A is dense in

Γ.

Proof.

Noting how the topology on Γ is defined, it suffices to show that each

non-empty sub-basic open set P (K, U ), where K is a compact subset of G and U
is an open subset of T, intersects A nontrivially.
As G is discrete, K is finite. Let H be the subgroup of G generated by K
and f ∗ : Γ → H ∗ the map obtained by restricting the characters of G to H .
According to Proposition A5.9.5 and Corollary A5.9.7, f ∗ is an open continuous
homomorphism of Γ onto H ∗ . As A separates points of G, f ∗ (A) separates points
of H .

Observing that Corollary 5.9.4 says that H satisfies the Pontryagin-van
Kampen Duality Theorem, Proposition A5.9.10 then implies that f ∗ (A) is dense in

H ∗ . So f ∗ (P (K, U )) ∩ f ∗ (A) 6= Ø. In other words there is a γ ∈ A such that, when
restricted to H , γ maps K into U . Of course this says that γ ∈ P (K, U ) ∩ A.

of Γ. As Γ is discrete, Proposition A5.11.1 then implies that α(G) is dense in Γ∗ .
However, α(G) is compact and hence closed in Γ∗ . Thus α(G) = Γ∗ ; that is, the
map α is onto. Finally, the Open Mapping Theorem for Locally Compact Groups
A5.4.4 tells us that α is also an open map.

A5.11.3

Corollary.

Let G be a compact Hausdorff abelian group and Γ its

dual group. If A is a subgroup of Γ which separates points of G, then A = Γ.

Proof.

This is an immediate consequence of Theorem A5.11.2, Proposition A

5.9.10, Corollary A5.3.7, and Corollary A5.7.7.

Let G be an LCA-group with enough characters to

extends to a character of G.

Let B be an LCA-group with enough characters to

quotient homomorphism.

Theorem.

(Pontryagin-van Kampen Duality Theorem for

Let G be a discrete abelian group and Γ its dual group.
Then the canonical map α is a topological group isomorphism of G onto Γ∗ .

Discrete Groups)

Proof.
As in Theorem A5.11.2, α is a continuous one-one homomorphism of G
into Γ∗ . As α(G) separates points of Γ and Γ is compact, Corollary A5.11.3 yields
that α(G) = Γ. As G and Γ∗ are discrete this completes the proof.
We conclude this section by showing how duality theory yields a complete
description of compact Hausdorff abelian torsion groups. (Recall that a group G is
said to be a torsion group if each of its elements is of finite order.) The first step
is the following interesting result.

Let Gi , i ∈ I , be a set of groups, for some index

set I . Then the subgroup H =
Gi of the direct product i∈I Gi , where

and only finitely many γi are non-zero, then γ is a character on G defined by

i∈I (gi , γi ), for each g ∈ G. (Observe that this is a finite sum!) Let us
denote the subgroup of G∗ consisting of all such γ by A. Then A is algebraically

isomorphic to the restricted direct product
Γi .
i∈I
We claim that A separates points of G. To see this let g ∈ G, g 6= 0. Then

(g, γ) =

g = (. . . , gi , . . . ) with some gi 6= 0. So there is a γi ∈ Γi such that γi (gi ) 6= 0.
Putting γ = (. . . , γj , . . . ) where γj = 0 unless j = i, we see that γ(g) = γi (gi ) 6= 0.
As γ ∈ A, A separates points of G. By Corollary A5.11.3, this implies that
A = G∗ .
A5.11.9

Corollary.

Every countable abelian group is algebraically

isomorphic to a quotient group of a countable restricted direct product of copies
of Z.

Proof.

Let G be a countable abelian group. Put the discrete topology on G and

let Γ be its dual group. Of course Γ is compact and by Exercises A5.10 #4, Γ is
topologically isomorphic to a subgroup of a product

Q

Ti of copies of T, where the

i∈I
cardinality of the index set I equals the cardinality of Γ∗ . By Theorem A5.11.6, Γ∗

a countable product of copies of T. Taking dual groups and using Theorem A5.11.8
and Corollary A5.11.5 we obtain the required result.

Of course the above corollary also follows from the fact that the free abelian
group on a countable set is a countable restricted direct product of copies of Z, and
that any countable abelian group is a quotient group of the free abelian group on a
countable set.

A5.11.10

Remark.

Kaplan [227, 228] has investigated generalizations of

Theorem A5.11.7 to direct products of non-compact groups. As a direct product of
LCA-groups is not, in general, an LCA-group we must first say what we mean by the
dual group of a non-LCA-group: If G is any abelian topological group we define Γ
to be the group of continuous homomorphisms of G into T, with the compact open
topology. Then Γ is an abelian topological group and we can form Γ∗ in the same
way. As in the locally compact case there is a natural map α which takes g ∈ G to

α(g) a function from Γ into T. We can then ask for which groups is α a topological
group isomorphism of G onto Γ∗ . Such groups will be called reflexive.
A satisfactory description of this class is not known, but it includes not only all
LCA-groups but also all Banach spaces (considered as topological groups). (See
Smith [366].) Kaplan showed that if {Gi : i ∈ I} is a family of reflexive groups

Q

Gi is also a reflexive group. Its dual group is algebraically isomorphic to the
i∈I
restricted direct product of the family {G∗i : i ∈ I}. The topology of the dual group

is slightly complicated to describe, but when I is countable it is simply the subspace

For further comments on reflexive groups see Brown et al. [60], Venkataraman

Reflexivity of abelian topological groups, including nuclear groups, has been
thoroughly studied in Banaszczyk [30].

To prove the structure theorem of compact Hausdorff abelian torsion groups we
have to borrow the following result of abelian group theory. (See Fuchs [143].)

A5.12

Monothetic LCA-groups and
Compactly Generated LCA-groups

We have proved the duality theorem for compact groups and for discrete groups.
To extend the duality theorem to all LCA-groups we shall prove two special cases
of the following proposition:
If G is an LCA-group with a subgroup H such that both H and G/H satisfy the
duality theorem, then G satisfies the duality theorem.
The two cases we prove are when H is compact and when H is open.
The duality theorem for all LCA-groups then follows from the fact that every LCAgroup G has an open subgroup H which in turn has a compact subgroup K such
that H/K is an “elementary group" which is known to satisfy the duality theorem.
By an “elementary group" we mean one which is of the form Ra × Zb × Tc × F ,
where F is a finite discrete abelian group and a, b and c are non-negative integers.
Once we have the duality theorem we use it, together with the above structural
result, to prove the Principal Structure Theorem.
We begin with some structure theory.

A5.12.1

Definition.

A topological group is said to be monothetic if it

has a dense cyclic subgroup.

A5.12.2

Examples.

Z and T are monothetic.

compact or G is topologically isomorphic to Z.

Proof.

If G is discrete then either G = Z or G is a finite cyclic group and hence

is compact. So we have to prove that G is compact if it is not discrete.
Then the dense cyclic subgroup {xn : n =
0, ±1, ±2, . . . }, where xn + xm = xn+m for each n and m, is infinite. (If the
Assume G is not discrete.

cyclic subgroup were finite it would be discrete and hence closed in G. As it is also
dense in G, this would mean that it would equal G and G would be discrete.)
Let V be an open symmetric neighbourhood of 0 in G with V compact. If

g ∈ G, then V + g contains some xk . So there is a symmetric neighbourhood W of
0 in G such that (g − xk ) + W ⊆ V . As G is not discrete, W contains an infinite
number of the xn and as W is symmetric x−n ∈ W if xn ∈ W . Hence there exists
a j < k such that xj ∈ W . Putting i = k − j we have i > 0 and
g − xi = g − xk + xj ∈ g − xk + W ⊆ V.
This proves that G =

∞
S

(xi + V ). (The important point is that we need xi

i=1
only for i > 0 .) As V is a compact subset of G we have that

V ⊆

(xi + V ), for some N.

i=1
For each g ∈ G, let n = n(g) be the smallest positive n such that g ∈ xn + V .
By (1), xn − g ∈ xi + V for some 1 ⩽ i ⩽ N . So we have that g ∈ xn−i + V .
Since i > 0, n − i < n and so by our choice of n, n − i ⩽ 0. Thus n ⩽ i ⩽ N .
So for each g ∈ G, n ⩽ N , which means that

G=

which is a finite union of compact sets and so G is compact.

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

Theorem.
A compact Hausdorff abelian group G is monothetic if
and only if G∗ is topologically isomorphic to a subgroup of Td , the circle group
endowed with the discrete topology.

A5.12.4

Proof.

Exercise.

We now use Theorem to obtain our first description of the structure of compactly
generated LCA-groups.

(Recall that an LCA-group G is said to be compactly

generated if it has a compact subset V such that G is generated algebraically by

V . Without loss of generality V can be chosen to be a symmetric neighbourhood
of 0.)

A5.12.5 Proposition.
If G is an LCA-group which is algebraically
generated by a compact symmetric neighbourhood V of 0, then G has a closed
subgroup A topologically isomorphic to Zn , for some integer n ⩾ 0, such that
G/A is compact and V ∩ A = {0}.

If we put V1 = V and inductively define Vn+1 = Vn + V , for each integer

such that V2 ⊆
(gi + V ). Let H be the group generated by {g1 , . . . , gm }. So
i=1
Vi ⊆ V + H , for i = 1 and i = 2. If we assume that Vn ⊆ V + H , then we have
Proof.

Vn+1 ⊆ V + (V + H) = V2 + H ⊆ (V + H) + H = V + H.
So, by induction, Vn ⊆ V + H , for all n ⩾ 1, and hence G = V + H .
Let Hi be the closure in G of the subgroup Hi generated by gi , for i = 1, . . . , m.
If each Hi is compact, then as H = H1 + · · · + Hm , H is compact and so

G = V + H is compact. (Use Exercises A5.1 #4.) The Proposition would then
be true with n = 0. If G is not compact, then, by Theorem A5.12.4, one of the
monothetic groups Hi is topologically isomorphic to Z. In this case Hi = Hi and
we deduce that

G is not compact, then H has a subgroup topologically

As H is a finitely generated abelian group (and every subgroup of an abelian
group with p generators can be generated by ⩽ p elements) there is a largest n
such that H contains a subgroup A topologically isomorphic to Zn . Since A is
discrete and V is compact, A ∩ V is finite. Without loss of generality we can assume
that A ∩ V = {0}. (If necessary we replace A by a subgroup A0 which is also
topologically isomorphic to Zn and has the property that A0 ∩ V {0}. For example, if

A = gp {a1 , . . . , an } and r is chosen such that A ∩ V ⊆ {k1 a1 + · · · + kn an : 1 − r ⩽
ki ⩽ r − 1, i = 1, . . . , n} then we put A0 = gp {ra1 , . . . , ran }.)
Let f be the canonical homomorphism of G onto K = G/A.

Then K =

f (V ) + f (H). By Exercises A5.12 #2 and our choice of n, f (H) has no subgroup
topologically isomorphic to Z. By (*) applied to K instead of G, we see that K is
compact, as required.
The above proposition allows us to prove a most important theorem which
generalizes Theorem A5.10.1.

584

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

A5.12.6

Theorem.

Every LCA-group has enough characters to separate

points.

Proof.

Let G be any LCA-group and g any non-zero element of G. Let V be

a compact symmetric neighbourhood of 0 which contains g . Then the subgroup H
generated algebraically by V is, by Proposition A5.2.9, an open subgroup of G.
By Proposition A5.12.5, H has a closed subgroup A such that H/A is compact
and V ∩ H = {0}. Defining f to be the canonical map of H onto H/A we see that

f (g) 6= 0.
According to Theorem A5.10.1 there is a continuous homomorphism φ : H/A →

T such that φ(f (g)) 6= 0. Then φf is a continuous homomorphism of H into T. As
H is an open subgroup of G and T is divisible, Proposition A5.3.6 tells us that φf
can be extended to a continuous homomorphism γ : G → T. Clearly γ(g) 6= 0 and
so G has enough characters to separate points.
A5.12.7

Corollary.

Let H be a closed subgroup of an LCA-group G. If

g is any element of G not in H , then there is a character γ of G such that
γ(g) 6= 0 but γ(h) = 0, for all h ∈ H .

Proof.

Exercise.

The next corollary is an immediate consequence of the opening sentences in the
proof of Theorem A5.12.6.

Every LCA-group has a subgroup which is both open

and a compactly generated LCA-group.

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

The next proposition gives another useful description of the structure of
compactly generated LCA-groups.

A5.12.10

Proposition.

If G is a compactly generated LCA-group, then

it has a compact subgroup K such that G/K is topologically isomorphic to
Ra × Zb × Tc × F , where F is a finite discrete abelian group and a, b and c are
non-negative integers.

Proof.

By Proposition A5.12.5 there exists a discrete finitely generated subgroup

D of G such that G/D is compact. Let N be a compact symmetric neighbourhood
of 0 such that 3N ∩ D = {0}. If f : G → G/D is the canonical homomorphism
then f (N ) is a neighbourhood of 0 in G/D and, by CorollaryA5.12.8, there exists
a closed subgroup B ⊆ f (N ) such that (G/D)/B is topologically isomorphic to
Tn × E , where E is a finite discrete group and n ⩾ 0. If we let K 0 = f −1 (B) then
we see that G/K 0 is topologically isomorphic to Tn × E .
Putting K = K 0 ∩ N , we have that K is compact and f (K) = B . To see that
K is a subgroup of G, let x and y be in K . Then x − y ∈ K 0 , so there is a z ∈ K
such that f (z) = f (x − y). This implies that x − y − z ∈ D , and since 3N ∩ D = {0}
it follows that x − y − z = 0; that is, x − y ∈ K and so K is a subgroup of G.
We claim that K 0 = K + D . For if k 0 ∈ K 0 , there is a k ∈ K such that

f (k 0 ) = f (k) and so k 0 − k ∈ D. Thus K 0 = K + D. By Exercises A5.4 #7, K 0
is topologically isomorphic to K × D . Hence if θ is the canonical map of G onto
G/K then θ(D) is topologically isomorphic to D and (G/K)/θ(D) is topologically
isomorphic to G/K 0 which is in turn topologically isomorphic to Tn × E . As θ(D)
and E are discrete, Exercises A5.5 #7 tells us that G/K is locally isomorphic to
Tn and hence also to Rn . Theorem A5.5.25 then says that G/K is topologically
isomorphic to Ra × Tc × S , where S is a discrete group and a ⩾ 0 and c ⩾ 0. As
G is compactly generated G/K and hence also S are compactly generated. So S
is a discrete finitely generated abelian group and thus is topologically isomorphic to
Zb × F , for some finite discrete group G and b ⩾ 0.

show that H contains a subgroup topologically isomorphic to Zn+1 .

of 1.
(v) The subgroup gp (U ) of G generated algebraically by U is open in G.
(vi) The subgroup gp (U ) of G generated algebraically by U is open in G, and

5. Let P be a property of topological groups; that is if topological groups G and

H are topologically isomorphic then G has property P if and only if H has
property P . The property P is said to be a three space property if whenever
G is any topological group with a closed normal subgroup N and the topological
groups N and G/N have property P , then G has property P . (See Bruguera

(i) Prove that “being a finite group” is a three space property.
(ii) Prove that “being a finitely generated group” is a three space property.
(iii) Prove that for any given infinite cardinal m, “being a topological group of

of G. If f : G → G/N is the canonical map, show that for each compact
subset C of G/N there exists a compact subset S of G such that f (S) = C .
(vi) Deduce that if N is a closed normal subgroup of a locally compact Hausdorff
group G such that both N and G/N are compactly generated, then G is also
compactly generated. So “being a compactly generated locally compact
Hausdorff group” is a three space property.
(vii) If in (v), N is also compact show that f −1 (C) is compact.
(viii) Deduce that if G is a Hausdorff topological group having a normal subgroup

K such that both K and G/K are compact, then G is compact. So “being
a compact Hausdorff group” is a three space property.

with Theorem A5.12.6 we see that f1∗ is both open and onto. To see that the image
of f2∗ equals the kernel of f1∗ consider the diagram

Let γ be any character of G/K and k any element of K . Then
f1∗ f2∗ γ(k) = γf2 f1 (k) = 0
as the given sequence is exact. Therefore f1∗ f2∗ (γ) = 0 and so Image f2∗ ⊆
Kernel f1∗ . Now if φ ∈ G∗ and f1∗ (φ) = 0, then we have φf1 (k) = 0 for all
k ∈ K . So there exists a homomorphism δ : G/K → T such that δf2 = φ. As f2
is both open and onto, δ is continuous. So Kernel f1∗ ⊆ Image f2∗ . Hence Image
f2∗ = Kernel f1∗ .
Finally we have to show that f2∗ is an open map. Let C be a compact
subset of G/K , U an open subset of T and P (C, U ) the set of all elements of
(G/K)∗ which map C into U . Then P (C, U ) is a sub-basic open set in (G/K)∗ .
Now by Exercises A5.12 #5(i) there exists a compact subset S of G such that
f2 (S) = C . Thus we see that P (S, U ) is a sub-basic open subset of G∗ such that
f2∗ (P (C, U )) = P (S, U ) ∩ f2∗ ((G/K)∗ ). So f2∗ is a homeomorphism of (G/K)∗ onto
its image in G∗ . As K ∗ is discrete, Kernel f1∗ is open in G∗ ; that is, Image f2∗ is
open in G∗ . So f2∗ is an open map.

Then the

is exact, f1∗ is open and continuous and f2∗ is a homeomorphism of (G/A)∗ onto
its image in G∗ .

Proof.
By Proposition A5.9.5, f1∗ is onto and f2∗ is one-one. That Image
f2∗ = Kernel f1∗ is proved exactly as in Proposition A5.13.2. As A is open in G,
G/A is discrete and (G/A)∗ is compact. As f2∗ is one-one and (G/A)∗ is compact,
f2∗ is a homeomorphism of (G/A)∗ onto its image in G∗ .
Finally we have to show that f1∗ is an open map. Let K be a compact
neighbourhood of 0 in G which lies in A. If Va is as in Corollary A5.7.7, then P (K, Va )
is an open set in G∗ such that P (K, Va ) is compact. Of course, f1∗ (P (K, Va ))
consists of those elements of A∗ which map K into Va , and so is open in A∗ . If we
put H equal to the group generated by f1∗ (P (K, Va )) then H is an open subgroup
of A∗ . Furthermore as gp {P (K, Va ))} is an open and closed subgroup of G∗ ,
P (K, Va ) ⊆ gp {P (K, Va )} = B . As B is generated by P (K, Va ) it is σ -compact.
The Open Mapping Theorem A5.4.4 then implies that f1∗ : B → H is open. As
B is an open subgroup of G∗ and H is an open subgroup of A∗ , f1∗ : G∗ → A∗ is
open.

This implies, by Proposition A5.13.4, that α is

an algebraic isomorphism. As α is continuous and G is compactly generated, the
Open Mapping Theorem A5.4.4 then implies that α is an open map, and hence a
topological isomorphism.
At long last we can prove the Pontryagin van-Kampen Duality for all LCA-groups.

595

A5.13.6

Theorem.

[Pontryagin-van Kampen Duality Theorem]

Let G

be an LCA-group and Γ its dual group. Then the canonical map α of G into
Γ∗ is a topological group isomorphism of G onto Γ∗ .

By Corollary A5.12.8, G has an open subgroup A which is compactly generated.
So we have an exact sequence

f1
f2
0 −−→ A −−→ G −−→ G/A −−→ 0
Applying Proposition A5.13.3 and then Proposition A5.13.2 yields the exact sequence

f2∗∗

As A is a compactly generated LCA-group and G/A is a discrete group, both A and

G/A satisfy the duality theorem and so αA and αG/A are topological isomorphisms.
By Proposition A5.13.4, α is an algebraic isomorphism. Since f1 , f1∗∗ and αA are
all open maps and αf1 = f1∗∗ αA , we see that α is also an open map, and hence a
topological isomorphism.
We can now prove the structure theorem for compactly generated LCAgroups, from which the Principal Structure Theorem for all LCA-groups is a trivial
consequence.

and non-negative integers a and b.

Proof.

By Proposition A5.12.10, we have an exact sequence

f1
f2
0 −−→ C −−→ G −−→ Ra × Zb × Tc × F −−→ 0
where C is a compact group, F is a finite discrete group and a, b and c are nonnegative integers. By Proposition A5.13.2, we, therefore, have an exact sequence

f2∗
f1∗
0 ←−− C ∗ ←−− G∗ ←−− Ra × Tb × Zc × F ←−− 0
where f2∗ is an open map. So G∗ has an open subgroup topologically isomorphic
to Ra × Tb . As R and T are divisible groups, Proposition A5.3.8 says that G∗ is
topologically isomorphic to Ra ×Tb ×D , for some discrete group D . As G satisfies the
duality theorem, G is topologically isomorphic to G∗∗ which in turn is topologically
isomorphic to Ra × Zb × K , where K is the compact group D ∗ .
Since every LCA-group has an open compactly generated subgroup we obtain
the Principal Structure Theorem for LCA-groups.

A5.13.8

Theorem.

[Principal Structure Theorem for LCA-Groups]
Every LCA-group has an open subgroup topologically isomorphic to Ra × K , for
some compact abelian group K and non-negative integer a.

As an immediate consequence we have the following significant result.

A5.13.9

Theorem.
Every connected LCA-group is topologically
a
isomorphic to R × K , where K is a compact connected abelian group and

a is a non-negative integer.

A5.13.10

Remarks.

(i) Theorem A5.13.7 generalizes the well-known result that every finitely generated
abelian group is the direct product of a finite number of copies of the infinite
cyclic group with a finite abelian group.
(ii) One might suspect that one could improve upon the Principal Structure Theorem
for LCA-Groups A5.13.8 and show that every LCA-group is topologically
isomorphic to Ra × K × D , where K is compact, D is discrete and a is a nonnegative integer. Unfortunately, as the following example shows, this statement
is false.

Q

Hi , where each Hi is a cyclic
i=1
group of order four. Let C be the subgroup of G consisting of all elements g ∈ G
∞
Q
such that 2g = 0. Then C is algebraically isomorphic to
Ci , where each Ci is a
i=1
cyclic group of order two. Put the discrete topology on each Ci and the product
topology on C . So C is a compact totally disconnected topological group.

A5.13.11

Example.

Let G be the group

Define a topology on G as follows: A base of open neighbourhoods at 0 in G
consists of all the open subsets of C containing 0. With this topology G is a totally
disconnected LCA-group having C as an open subgroup.
Suppose that G is topologically isomorphic to Ra ×K ×D , where K is a compact
abelian group, D is a discrete abelian group, and a is a non-negative integer. As G
is totally disconnected, a = 0. Further, as G is not compact, D must be infinite.
By the Principal Structure Theorem for LCA-Groups A5.13.8, G has an open
subgroup H . As G is totally disconnected a = 0. topologically isomorphic to Ra ×C ,
where C is compact and a is a non-negative integer. Suppose that G is topologically
isomorphic to H × D , where D is a discrete subgroup of G. As G is not compact

D must be infinite
As D is discrete and C is compact, D ∩ C is finite.
If x ∈ D , then 2x ∈ D ∩ C . If 2x = 2y , for y ∈ D , then 2(x − y) = 0, and so
x − y ∈ D ∩ C . As D ∩ C is finite, 2x = 2y for only a finite number of y ∈ D. Hence
D is finite. This is a contradiction and so our supposition is false.

8. A topological group G is said to be minimally almost periodic (m.a.p.) (von
Neumann [411], von Neumann and Wigner [412]) if there every continuous
homomorphism φ of G into every compact Hausdorff group satisfies φ(g) = 1,
for each g ∈ G; that is, every continuous homomorphism of G into a compact
Hausdorff group is trivial. A group H is said to be simple if it has no normal
subgroups other than 1 and H . A topological group S is said to be topologically
simple if its only closed normal subgroups are 1 and S .
(i) Verify that every simple group with the discrete topology is topologically
simple.
(ii) Verify that every infinite topologically simple group is minimally almost
periodic.
(iii) Verify that no infinite abelian group is a simple group.
It is easy to verify that there exist infinite simple groups, which by (i) and (ii)
above show that there exist minimally almost periodic groups. Let ℵ be any
infinite cardinal number and S a set of cardinality ℵ. Let Aℵ be the group of
all even permutations of S which fix all but a finite number of members of S .
That Aℵ is a simple group follows easily from 3.2.4 of Robinson [342]
The concept of minimally periodic group was introduced by John von Neumann
and in a subsequent paper with Nobel prize-winning physicist Eugene Paul
Wigner (1902-1995) proved that the Special Linear group SL(2, C) with even

A5.14 Consequences of the Duality Theorem
Part One: Kronecker’s Theorem
We begin this section by showing that the dual of a subgroup is a quotient group
and the dual of a quotient group is a subgroup.

A5.14.1

Definition.

Let H be a closed subgroup of the LCA-group G and

Ω the set of all γ in the dual group Γ of G such that (h, γ) = 0, for all h ∈ H .
Then Ω is called the annihilator of H .
For fixed h ∈ H , the continuity of (h, γ) shows that the set of all γ with

(h, γ) = 0 is closed, so that Ω is the intersection of closed sets and is therefore
closed. Clearly Ω is a group and so it is a closed subgroup of Γ.

602

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

A5.14.2

Proposition.

With the above notation, if Ω is the annihilator of

H , then H is the annihilator of Ω.

Proof.

If h ∈ H , then (h, γ) = 0 for all γ ∈ Ω. If g ∈ G and g 6∈ H then, by

Corollary A5.12.7 there is a γ ∈ Ω such that (g, γ) 6= 0.

A5.14.3

Theorem.

Let H be a closed subgroup of an LCA-group G. If

Γ is the dual group of G and Ω is the annihilator of H , then Ω and Γ/Ω are
topologically isomorphic to the dual groups of G/H and H , respectively.

Let f be the canonical homomorphism of G onto G/H .
Then
Proposition A5.9.5 says that the map f ∗ : (G/H)∗ → G∗ is a continuous one-one
Proof.

homomorphism. Further, the last paragraph of the proof of Proposition A5.13.3
shows that f ∗ is a homeomorphism of (G/H)∗ onto its image in G∗ . Of course the
definition of f ∗ tells us that f ∗ ((G/H)∗ ) = Ω, and so Ω is topologically isomorphic
to (G/H)∗ .
The fact that Γ/Ω is topologically isomorphic to H ∗ then follows from the above,
together with Proposition A5.14.2 and the duality theorem.



As a corollary we have the following generalization of Corollary A5.11.4.

A5.14.4

Corollary.

If H is a closed subgroup of an LCA-group G, then

every character on H can be extended to a character on G.

Proof.

If φ is a character on H , then by Theorem A5.14.3, φ ∈ Γ/Ω. If f is the

canonical homomorphism of Γ onto Γ/Ω and f (γ) = φ, γ ∈ Γ, then (h, γ) = (h, φ),
for all h ∈ H . So γ is the required extension of φ.



603

We now record an application in the area of diophantine approximation.
Firstly observe that the definition of the annihilator of a subgroup H of an
LCA-group G would make sense even if H were not closed in G. However it is
obvious that the annihilator of H , Ω(H), would equal Ω(H). We will see that this
observation is quite useful.

Let G be a (not necessarily closed) subgroup of Rn ,
n ⩾ 1. Let Ω(G) denote the annihilator of G in (Rn )∗ = Rn . then Ω(G) =
{y ∈ Rn : (y|x) is an integer for each x ∈ G}, where y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) ∈ Rn ,
P
x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ G ⊆ Rn and (y|x) = ni=1 yi xi .

A5.14.5

Proof.

Proposition.

Exercise.



As an immediate consequence of Proposition A5.14.2 we have the following
result.

A5.14.6

Proposition.

If G is any subgroup of Rn , n ⩾ 1, then Ω(Ω(G)) =

G.
Translating Proposition A5.14.6 using Proposition A5.14.5 we obtain a characterization
of those points lying in the closure of a subgroup of Rn .
A5.14.7 Proposition.
A point x lies in the closure of a subgroup G of
Rn , n ⩾ 1 if and only if (y|x) is an integer for all y ∈ Rn such that (y|g) is an
integer for all g ∈ G.

604

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

We apply this characterization to the case where G
is the subgroup of Rn , n ⩾ 1 generated by the vectors

e1 , . . . , en of the canonical basis and by an arbitrary
number m of points ai , i = 1, . . . , m of Rn . To say
that (y|ei ) is an integer, for i = 1, . . . , n means that
each coordinate of y is an integer. So we obtain the
following theorem of the German mathematician Leopold
Kronecker (1823–1891).

[Kronecker once said: “Die

ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere
ist Menschenwerk” (“God made the integers, all else is

Kronecker

the work of man.”)]

(Kronecker) Let ai = (ai1 , . . . , ain ) for i = 1, . . . , m
and b = (b1 , . . . , bn ) be points of Rn , n ⩾ 1. In order that for each ε > 0 there
exists integers q1 , . . . , qm and integers p1 , . . . , pn such that

A5.14.8

Theorem.

q1 a1j + q2 a2j + · · · + qm amj − pj bj ⩽ ε for j = 1, . . . , n
it is necessary and sufficient that for each finite sequence r1 , . . . , rn of integers
Pn
such that the numbers
j=1 aij rj , for i = 1, . . . , m, are all integers, the number
Pn
j=1 bj rj should also be an integer.

605

Putting m = 1 we obtain the following corollary which is a generalization of
Exercise Set A5.5 #3 (ii).

A5.4.19

Corollary.

Let θ1 , . . . , θn be real numbers. In order that, given

any n real numbers x1 , . . . , xn and a real number ε > 0, there should exist an
integer q and n integers pj such that

qθj − pj − xj ⩽ ε for j = 1, . . . , n
it is necessary and sufficient that there exist no relation of the form
n
X

rj θj = h ,

j=1
where the rj are integers not all zero and h is an integer. (In particular this
implies that the θj and the ratios θj /θk , j 6= k , must be irrational.)

For some further comments in this area of approximation see Hewitt and Ross
[180, §26.19] and Bourbaki [51, §1.3 of Vol. 2].

isomorphic to Tb × F , where F is a finite discrete group and b ⩾ 0.]
6. Let G be a subgroup of Rn , n ⩾ 1 and Ω(G) its annihilator. Show that Ω(G) =

7. Recall that a topological group G is said to be almost connected if the quotient
group G/G0 is compact, where G0 is the connected component of the identity
element of G.

If G is an almost connected LCA-group, show that G is
topologically isomorphic to Rn × K , for some compact group K and n ⩾ 0.

A5.15 Consequences of the Duality Theorem
Part Two: Connected and Totally Disconnected LCA-groups

A5.15.1

Theorem.

Let G be an LCA-group and Γ its dual group. Then

G is metrizable if and only if Γ is σ -compact.

Assume that G is metrizable. Then G has a countable base of compact
neighbourhoods U1 , U2 , . . . , Un , . . . of 0. By Corollary A5.7.7, if a = 51 , then the
sets P (Ui , Va ), i = 1, 2, . . . , are compact neighbourhoods of 0 in Γ. As each γ ∈ Γ
∞
S
is continuous, Γ =
P (Ui , Va ). So Γ is σ -compact.
i=1
Conversely, assume that Γ is σ -compact. By Exercises A5.12 #4, there exists
Proof.

a family {Yn }, n = 1, 2, . . . of compact neighbourhoods of 0 in Γ such that every
compact subset of Γ lies in some Yn and Yn ⊆ Yn+1 , n ⩾ 1.

So the family

{g ∈ G : (g, γ) ∈ V1/k , for all γ ∈ Yn }, for k = 2, 3, . . . and n = 1, 2, . . . is a
base of neighbourhoods of 0 in G. (Observe that in saying that these sets are
neighbourhoods we are using the fact that G is the dual group of Γ.) Thus G has
a countable base of neighbourhoods at 0 which, by Exercises A5.6 #3(ii), implies
that G is metrizable.


608

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

As a corollary we have the following striking result.

A5.15.2

Let G be an LCA-group.

Corollary.

Then G is compact and

metrizable if and only if its dual group Γ is countable.

Proof.



Exercise.

We now characterize those compact groups which are connected.

A5.15.3

Proposition.

Let G be a locally compact Hausdorff group and

K a compact subset of G. Then there exists an open and closed compactly
generated subgroup of G containing K .

Proof.

A5.5.4



Exercise.

Definition.

An element g of a topological group G is said to be

compact if gp {g}, the smallest closed subgroup of G containing g , is compact.

A5.15.5

Example.

An element g ∈ G = Ra × Zb × K , where K is compact

and a ⩾ 0 and b ⩾ 0, is compact if and only if it lies in {0} × {0} × K .



609

A5.15.6

Proposition.

If G is an LCA-group, then the set S of compact

elements is a closed subgroup of G.

Proof.

If g and h are in S , then g − h ∈ gp {g} + gp {h} ⊆ gp {g} + gp {h}. As

g − h lies in the compact group gp {g} + gp {h}, it is compact and so is in S . Thus
S is a subgroup of G.
Now let x ∈ S . By Proposition A5.15.3 there is an open compactly generated
subgroup H of G containing x. By Theorem A5.13.7, H is topologically isomorphic
to Ra × Zb × K , where K is compact, a ⩾ 0 and b ⩾ 0. To see that x ∈ S we
have to show only that the Ra coordinate of x and the Zb coordinate of x are both
zero. If the Ra coordinate of x or the Zb coordinate of x were different from zero,
then there would be an entire neighbourhood of x disjoint from S –since all compact
elements of Ra × Zb × K lie in {0} × {0} × K . This would contradict the fact that

x ∈ S.
A5.15.7

Remark.

The set of compact elements of a non-abelian locally

compact Hausdorff group G need not be a subgroup of G. As an example of this,
let G be the discrete group generated by two elements a and b with the relations
a2 = b2 = e. Then a and b are compact elements, but ab is not compact.


610

APPENDIX 5: TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS: A GRADUATE COURSE

A5.15.8

Theorem.

Let G be an LCA-group, Γ its dual group, S the set

of compact elements in Γ and C the component of 0 in G. Then S is the
annihilator in Γ of C and C is the annihilator in G of S .

Proof.
(i) Assume that there is a compact subgroup K of Γ such that K 6= {0}. Then G
has a discrete quotient group K ∗ . As K ∗ is not connected, G is not connected.
(ii) Assume that G is totally disconnected. Let γ ∈ Γ and U be a neighbourhood
of 0 in G such that γ(g) ∈ V1/4 , for all g ∈ U . As G is locally compact and
totally disconnected, Exercises A5.3 #4(i) implies that U contains a compact
open subgroup K . It is clear that γ(K) is a subgroup of V1/4 and hence equals

{0}; that is, γ ∈ Λ(Γ, K) the annihilator in Γ of K . As K is open in G, Λ(Γ, K),
is compact. So every γ ∈ Γ lies in a compact group. Hence S = Γ.
(iii) Now let G be any LCA-group. Then G/C is a totally disconnected LCA-group
and so, by (ii), the dual group of G/C contains only compact elements. As
(G/C)∗ is topologically isomorphic to Λ(Γ, C), we see that Λ(Γ, C) ⊆ S . As
C is a connected LCA-group (i) implies that C ∗ has no nontrivial compact
subgroup; that is, Γ/Λ(Γ, C) has no compact subgroup. Suppose γ ∈ S and

γ 6∈ Λ(Γ, C). Then there is a compact subgroup K of Γ whose image under
the canonical map f : Γ → Γ/Λ(Γ, C) is not {0}. This image is a compact
subgroup of Γ/Λ(Γ, C) and so we have a contradiction. Hence S ⊆ Λ(Γ, C).
Thus S = Λ(Γ, C).
The dual statement then follows from Proposition A5.14.2.
Let G be an LCA-group.
Then G is totally
disconnected if and only if every element in G∗ is compact.

A5.15.10 Corollary.
Let G be an LCA-group. Then G is connected if and

A5.15.11

Corollary.

Let G be a compact Hausdorff abelian group with C

the component of 0 in G. Let Φ be the torsion subgroup of Γ (that is, the
subgroup consisting of all elements of finite order). Then Φ = Λ(Γ, C), the
annihilator in Γ of C , and C = Λ(G, Φ). Also Φ is isomorphic to (G/C)∗ .

Proof.

The first two equalities follow from the Theorem A5.15.7, since an

element of a discrete group is compact if and only if it has finite order. The last
statement follows from the duality between subgroups and quotient groups.



As an immediate consequence of Corollary A5.15.11 we have an interesting
characterization of those compact groups which are connected.

A5.15.12

Corollary.

A compact Hausdorff abelian group is connected if

and only if its dual group is torsion free.



Notation. Let G be an abelian group and fn the homomorphism of G into itself
given by fn (g) = ng , for n a positive integer. We denote fn (G) by G(n) and fn−1 {0}
by G(n) .

A5.15.13

Proposition.

Let G be an LCA-group with dual group Γ. For

any n ∈ N,
(i) Λ(Γ, G(n) ) = Γ
(ii) Λ(Γ, G(n)

Proof.

(n) , and
) = Γ(n) .

Let γ ∈ Λ(Γ, G(n) ).

Then for each g ∈ G we have ng ∈ G(n)

Conversely, if γ ∈ Γ(n) , then
nγ(g) = γ(ng) = 0, for all g ∈ G, and so γ ∈ Λ(Γ, G(n) ). Hence (i) is true.
and so γ(ng) = nγ(g) = 0.

Thus γ ∈ Γ(n) .

To prove (ii) regard G as the dual group of Γ. Then, by (i), Λ(G, Γ(n) ) = G(n)
and so

Γ(n) = Λ(Γ, Λ(G, Γ(n) )) = Λ(Γ, Λ(G, Γ(n) )) = Λ(Γ, G(n) ).

Theorem.

for n ∈ N. Let G be discrete or compact. Then G is divisible if and only if Γ is
torsion-free.

Proof.

If G is divisible then G(n) = G, for all n and so Proposition A5.15.13(i)

implies that Γ(n) = {0}; that is, Γ is torsion-free.
If Γ is torsion-free then Proposition A5.15.13(ii) shows that Λ(G, Γ(n) ) = G =

G(n) , for each n ∈ N.
If G is discrete then G(n) is certainly closed, for each n ∈ N. If G is compact
then G(n) is a continuous image of G and so is compact and closed. So in both
cases G = G(n) , for all n ∈ N, and G is divisible.

Let G be a compact Hausdorff abelian group and Γ

its dual group. Then the following are equivalent:
(i) G is connected;
(ii) Γ is torsion-free;
(iii) G is divisible.

Every connected LCA-group G is divisible.

G is topologically isomorphic to Rn × K , where K is compact and
connected, from which the result immediately follows.

However, it is true that a connected locally compact

Introduction36
In the theory of metric spaces, convergent sequences play a key role.

This is

because they can be used to capture everything about the topology of the metric
space. For example, a set S in a metric space (X, d) is closed if and only if every
convergent sequence of points in S converges to a point in S .

So convergent

sequences determine the closed sets, the open sets, the continuous functions and the
topological properties. For example, a mapping between metric spaces is continuous
if and only if it maps convergent sequences to convergent sequences, and a subset

C of a metric space is compact if and only if every sequence consisting of points in
C has a subsequence which converges.
However, every metric space (X, d) satisfies the first axion of countability, that
is, every point in X has a countable base of neighbourhoods or, in other words,
for each point a ∈ X there is a countable set of neighbourhoods U1 , U2 , . . . , Un , . . .
such that every neighbourhood of a contains a Un for some n ∈ N . [We can choose
Un = {x ∈ X : d(x, a) < n1 }, for each n ∈ N.] However, a general topological
space does not necessarily satisfy the first axiom of countability; that is, it need not
have a countable base of neighbourhoods for each point. For this reason convergent
sequences, which are of course countable sets, do not capture the topology of a
general toplogical space.
Therefore we need a more general concept than convergent sequences which is
rich enough to capture the topology of general topological spaces. In this appendix
we introduce the notion of a filter. Filters do indeed capture everything about the
topology of a general topological space. In particular, we shall see how closedness,
continuity, and compactness can be expressed in terms of filters.

We shall also

see how filters can be used to give an alternative proof of the powerful Tychonoff
Theorem.
There is an equivalent, but less elegant, generalization of convergent sequences
which uses nets rather than filters. It is interesting to note that filters, which were
introduced by Cartan [69, 70] in 1937, have been the preferred approach of many

APPENDIX 6: FILTERS AND NETS

European (especially, French) mathematicians, while American mathematicians have
tended to prefer nets, which were introduced in 1922 by E.H. Moore and H.L. Smith
[289]. Bourbaki [51] sum up their philospophy on fllters: ’it replaces to advantage
the notion of “Moore-Smith convergence”’. Here we treat both filters and nets.

A6.1

Filters

§A6.1 introduces filters and ultrafilters on any non-empty set X .

Filters and

ultrafilters are then related to the notion of a topology on the set X . It is shown
how the property of Hausdorffness can be expressed in terms of filters or ultrafilters.
But the magic of ultrafilters, in particular, is demonstrated in an elegant proof of
the powerful Tychonoff Theorem for compact spaces.
So we begin with the definition of a fliter and find examples. Then we introduce
the notion of an ultrafilter and verify that for every filter there is a finer filter which is
an ultrafilter. We find a beautiful characterization of ultrafilters amongst all filters.

A6.1.1

Definition.

Let X be a set and F a set of subsets of X . Then F

is said to be a filter on X if
(i) F1 , F2 ∈ F implies F1 ∩ F2 ∈ F ;
(ii) F ∈ F and F ⊆ G ⊆ X imply G ∈ F ; and
(iii) Ø ∈
/ F.

621

A6.1.2

Remarks.

(i) If F is a filter on a set X , then by Definition A6.1.1(ii), X ∈ F .
(ii) If F is a filter on a set X , then it is not a topology on X .
[This is clear since Ø ∈
/ F .]

τ is a topology on a set X , then τ is not a filter on X .
[Again this is clear, since Ø ∈ τ .]
(iv) If F is a filter on a set X , then τ = F ∪ {Ø} is a topology on X .
[We see that X ∈ τ , Ø ∈ τ , and unions and finite interesections of sets in τ
are in τ by Definition A6.1.1 (ii) and Definition A6.1.1(i), respectively. So τ is

(iii) If

indeed a topology on X .]

τ is a topology on a set X , then τ \ {Ø} is not necessarily a filter on X .
[For example, if τ is the Euclidean topology on R, then S = τ \ {Ø} is not a

(v) If

filter since the open interval (0, 1) is a member of S , while the closed interval

[0, 1] is not a member of S , and so S does not satisfy Definition A6.1.1(ii).]
T
(vi) If F is a filter on a set X such that
Fi = Ø, then F is said to be a free
Fi ∈F

filter.
A6.1.3

Examples.

(i) Let X be any non-empty set and F consist of just the set X . Then F is a filter
on X .
(ii) Let X be any non-empty set and S a subset of X . If F consists of S and all
subsets of X which contain S , then F is a filter on X and is called the principal
filter generated by S
(iii) Let X be an infinite set and F = {F : Ø 6= F ⊆ X, X\F is a finite subset of X}.
Then F is a filter on X and is called the Fréchet filter. Every Fréchet filter is
a free filter and every free filter contains the Fréchet filter. [Verify this.]
(iv) Let (X,

τ ) be a topological space. For each x ∈ X , the set of all neighbourhoods

of x is a filter. This filter is known as the neighbourhood filter, Nx , of the
point x in (X,

τ ). A neighbourhood filter is clearly not a free filter.

(v) Let f be a mapping of a set X into a set Y and F a filter on X . Then f (F)
is a filter on Y if and only if f is surjective. Further, f −1 (f (F)) = F .
[Verify these statements.]

622

APPENDIX 6: FILTERS AND NETS

A6.1.4

Proposition.

(i) If F is a fliter on a set X , then F has the finite intersection property; that
is, if F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn ∈ F, n ∈ N, then F1 ∩ F2 ∩ · · · ∩ Fn 6= Ø;
(ii) Let S be a set of subsets of a non-empty set X . There exists a filter F on

X such that S ⊆ F if and only if S has the finite intersection property.

Proof.

Part (i) follows from (i) and (iii) of Defintion A6.1.1 using mathematical

induction.
If F is a filter containing S , then it follows from (i) that F , and hence also

S , has the finite intersection property. Conversely, if S has the finite intersection
property, define

F = {F : F ⊆ X such that there exist S1 , S2 , . . . , Sn ∈ S, n ∈ N with

n
\

Si ⊆ F.}

i=1
Clearly F satisfies Definition A6.1.1 and S ⊆ F , and so part (ii) is proved.



Using Proposition A6.1.4(ii) we introduce the following definition.

A6.1.5

Definition.

Let S be a non-empty set of subsets of a non-empty

set X . If S has the finite intersection property, then the filter

F = {F : F ⊆ X such that there exist S1 , . . . , Sn ∈ S, with

n
\

Si ⊆ F.}

i=1
is said to be the filter generated by S .

A6.1.6

Definitions.

Let F1 and F2 be filters on a set X . Then F1 is said

to be finer than F2 , and F2 is said to be coarser than F1 , if F2 ⊆ F1 . Further,
if F1 6= F2 also, then F1 is said to be strictly finer than F2 , and F2 is said to
be strictly coarser than F1 .

623

A6.1.7

Remarks.

(i) Let S be a non-empty set of subsets of a non-empty set X , where S has the
finite intersection property. Then the filter generated by S is the coarsest filter
on X containing the set S .
(ii) Let I be an index set and Fi , i ∈ I , a non-empty set of filters on a set X .
Put S = {F : F ∈ Fi , i ∈ I}. If S has the finite intersection property, then by
Proposition A6.1.4,

F = {F : F ⊆ X such that there exist S1 , . . . , Sn ∈ S, n ∈ N, with

n
\

Si ⊆ F.}

i=1
is the filter generated by S , and is the coarsest filter containing each of the
filters Fi , i ∈ I . So F is the coarsest filter that is finer than each Fi , i ∈ I .

A6.1.8

Definition.

Let X be a non-empty set and U a filter on X . Then

U is said to be an ultrafilter on X if no filter on X is strictly finer than U .

A6.1.9

Remark.

Let X be a non-empty set and x0 ∈ X . Let U be the set of

all subsets of X which contain the given element x0 . Then U is an ultrafilter. The
proof of this is left as an exercise.

624

APPENDIX 6: FILTERS AND NETS

A6.1.10

Proposition.

(Ultrafilter Lemma)

If F0 is any filter on a set X ,

then there exists an ultrafilter U on X such that U is finer than F0 .

Proof.

Let F0 denote the set of all filters on the set X which are finer than the

given fliter F0 . Noting Definition 10.2.1, we see that we can make F0 into a partially
ordered set (F0 , ⩽) by putting Fi ⩽ Fj , for Fi , Fj ∈ F0 , if Fi ⊆ Fj . Observe that
as F0 ∈ F0 , F0 is a non-empty set. We shall now apply Zorn’s Lemma 10.2.16.
Let F1 be any subset of F0 . Then the partial order ⩽ on F0 induces a partial
order on F1 . If (F1 , ⩽) is a linearly ordered set of filters, then we claim that there is
a filter F2 which is an upper bound of F1 .
Define F2 = {F : F ∈ Fi , Fi ∈ F1 }; in other words, F2 is the union of all
the filters in F1 . We will show that F2 is a filter by verifying it satisfies Definition
A6.1.1. As the empty set, Ø, is not a member of any of the filters Fi in F1 , Ø ∈
/ F2 .
If F1 , F2 ∈ F2 , F1 ∈ Fi ∈ F1 and F2 ∈ Fj ∈ F1 . As F1 is a linearly ordered set,
without loss of generality we can assume Fi ⩽ Fj ; that is, Fi ⊆ Fj . So Fi , F2 ∈ Fj .
As Fj is a filter, F1 ∩ F2 ∈ Fj ⊆ F2 . Finally, let F ∈ F2 and let G be a subset of X
containing F . Then F ∈ Fi ∈ F1 . As Fi is a filter, G ∈ Fi ⊆ F2 . So F2 is indeed a
filter. Clearly F2 is an upper bound of F1 . Then by Zorn’s Lemma 10.2.16, F0 has
a maximal element, U .
Suppose F3 is a filter on X which is strictly finer than U . As U ∈ F0 , U is finer
than F0 . Then F3 is also finer than F0 . So F3 ∈ F0 . But this contradicts the
maximality of U . So our supposition is false, and no filter is strictly finer than U .
So U is indeed an ultrafilter and is finer than F0 .

A6.1.11

Remark.

As any filter finer than a free filter is a free filter, it follows

from the Ultrafilter Lemma A6.1.10 and Example A6.1.3(iii) that free ultrafilters
exist. The existence of free ultrafilters is by no means obvious.
As an immediate consequence of the Ultrafilter Lemma A6.1.10 and Proposition
A6.1.4 we have the next corollary which is, in fact, a generalisation of the Ultrafilter
Lemma A6.1.10.

625

A6.1.12

Corollary.

If S is a non-empty set of subsets of a non-empty set

X and S has the finite intersection property, then there is an ultrafilter U on X
such that S ⊆ U .

A6.1.13

Corollary.

Let U be an ultrafilter on a set X . If A and B are

subsets of X such that A ∪ B ∈ U , then either A ∈ U or B ∈ U . In particular,
if A is any subset of X , then either A ∈ U or X \ A ∈ U .

Proof.

Suppose there exist F1 , F2 ∈ U such that F1 ∩ A = Ø and F2 ∩ B = Ø,

where A ∪ B ∈ U . Then (F1 ∩ F2 ) ∩ (A ∪ B) = Ø. But this is a contradiction
as F1 ∩ F2 and A ∪ B are members of the filter U . So, without loss of generality,
asssume F ∩ A 6= Ø, for all F ∈ U .
Let S = U ∪ {A}. Then S has the finite intersection property. By Corollary
A6.1.12, there exists an ultrafilter U1 such that U ⊆ S ⊆ U1 .

But this is a

contradiction unless U = U1 , as the ultrafilter U is maximal. Thus A ∈ U , which



completes the proof.
Corollary A6.1.13 suggests a characterization of ultrafilters amongst all filters.
A6.1.14

Proposition.

Let F be a filter on a set X . Then F is an ultrafilter

on X if and only if it has the property that for every subset A of X , either A ∈ F
or (X \ A) ∈ F .

Proof.

If F is an ultrafilter, then Corollary A6.1.13 shows that for every subset

A of X , A ∈ F or X \ A ∈ F .
Now assume that for every subset A of X , A ∈ F or (X \ A) ∈ F . Suppose F
is not an ultrafilter. Then there exists a filter F1 such that F ⊂ F1 . So there exists
a subset S of X such that S ∈ F1 but S 6∈ F . By our assumption, (X \ S) ∈ F .
This implies (X \ S) ∈ F1 . So both S and X \ S are members of the filter F1 and

S ∩ (X \ S) = Ø. This is a contradiction to F1 being a filter. So our supposition is
false, and F is indeed an ultrafilter.

Ui = Ø or there exists an x0 ∈ X such that {x0 } ∈ U and

Then either



Let f be a mapping of a set X into a set Y and let

U be an ultrafilter on X . Then f (U) is an ultrafilter on Y if and only if f is
surjective.

Proof.

ByExamples A6.1.3(v), f (U) is a filter on Y if and only if f is surjective.

So let us assume that f is surjective. We shall prove that f (U) is an ultrafilter using
Proposition A6.1.14. So, let A be any subset of Y . As f is surjective,

(X \ f −1 (A)) = f −1 (Y \ A).
Since U is an ultrafilter, f −1 (A) ∈ U

A ∈ f (U)

or

or

(X \ f −1 (A)) ∈ U . Thus

f (X \ f −1 (A)) = f (f −1 (Y \ A)) = (Y \ A) ∈ f (U).

So f (U) is an ultrafilter by Proposition A6.1.14.

each i ∈ I . As each Ui is a filter, (X \ S) ∈
/ Ui , for each i ∈ I . So (X \ S) ∈
/ F . Let

F = {Fj : j ∈ J} for some index set J . Either (i) (X \ S) ∩ Fj 6= Ø, for each j ∈ J
or (ii) (X \ S) ∩ Fj = Ø, for some j ∈ J .
In case (i), {Fj : j ∈ J} ∪ {X \ S} has the finite intersection property. So by
Corollary A6.1.12, there exists an ultrafilter U such that U ⊇ ({Fj : j ∈ J}∪{X \S});
that is, (X \ S) ∈ U and F ⊆ U . So U = Ui and (X \ S) ∈ Ui , for some i ∈ I . This
is a contradiction, and so case (i) cannot occur.
In case (ii), for some j ∈ J , (X \ S) ∩ Fj = Ø and thus Fj ⊆ S . As Fj ∈ F and

F is a filter, this implies S ∈ F . This too is a contradiction, and so case (ii) cannot
occur.
Thus our supposition is false; that is, S cannot exist. This says that F =

Remark.

As an immediate consequence of Proposition A6.1.17 we

obtain the following: If F is a filter on a set X and there exists an ultrafilter U on

X which is strictly finer than F , then there must exist at least one other ultrafilter
(strictly) finer than F .

While filters on sets are interesting, our focus is on topological spaces.

So

we now examine the interplay between topologies and filters via the notion of
convergence.

By Lemma A6.1.16, pi (U) is an ultrafilter on (Xi , τ i ), for each i ∈ I . As
(Xi , τ i ) is compact, Corollary A6.1.24 implies that pi (U) converges in (Xi , τ i ), for

Let Oj be any open neighbourhood in (Xj ,

A6.1.26

Remark.

It is appropriate for us to say a few words about Set Theory,

on which our study of Topology rests. The standard axioms for Set Theory are known
as the Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) axioms. These are named after the mathematicians,
Ernst Zermelo [1871–1953] and Abraham Halevi Fraenkel37 [1891–1965]. In 1904,
Zermelo formulated the Axiom of Choice (AC), which says:
For any set {Xi : i ∈ I} of non-empty sets, we can choose a member from
each Xi .
More formally this says:
For any set {Xi : i ∈ I} of non-empty sets, there exists a function

f :I→

S

Xi such that f (x) ∈ Xi for every i ∈ I .
i∈I
In language more familiar to readers of this book, we can state the Axiom of Choice
as follows:
For any set {Xi : i ∈ I} of non-empty sets,

Q

i∈I Xi is non-empty.

Zermelo said that the Axiom of Choice is an unobjectionable logical principle. It
is known that the Axiom of Choice is not implied by the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms,
but is consistent with them; that is, AC is independent of, but consistent with, ZF.
During much of the twentieth century, AC was controversial. Mathematicians were
divided on whether AC is true or false or whether it should be assumed [that is,
added to the ZF axioms] and used. Jan Mycielski [300] relates an anecdote which
37

Fraenkel was the first Dean of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

633

demonstrates this very well:
The mathematician Alfred Tarski (1902–1983) tried to publish his theorem proving
the equivalence between AC and “every infinite set A has the same cardinality as the
product set A × A” in the oldest extant mathematics journal in the world, Comptes
Rendus, but the mathematicians Maurice René Fréchet (1878–1973) and Henri-Léon
Lebesgue (1875–1941) refused to present it.

Fréchet wrote that an implication

between two well known true propositions is not a new result, and Lebesgue wrote
that an implication between two false propositions is of no interest.
In this book we do not hesitate to use the Axiom of Choice. The Axiom of Choice
is equivalent to Zorn’s Lemma 10.2.16 and to the Well-Ordering Theorem [WOT]
10,2,15 (which says that every set can be well-ordered). It is also equivalent to
Tychonoff ’s Theorem which says that any product of compact spaces is compact.
However, if you examine the above proof of Tychonoff ’s Theorem, you will
see that the special case of Tychonoff ’s Theorem which says that any product of
compact Hausdorff spaces is compact Hausdorff, does not require the Axiom of
Choice but only the Ultrafilter Lemma, as pi (U) converges to a unique point in a
Hausdorff space and so no choice is needed. But we did use Zorn’s Lemma in our
proof of the Ultrafilter Lemma. While the Ultrafilter Lemma is implied by the
Axiom of Choice, it is not equivalent to the Axiom of Choice, it is in fact weaker.
In summary, the following four statements are equivalent to each other:
(i) Axiom of Choice (ii) Zorn’s Lemma (iii) Well-Ordering Theorem and (iv)
Tychonoff ’s Theorem.
Ultrafilter Lemma.

Each of these implies, but is not implied by, the

Further, none of these is implied by the Zermelo-Fraenkel

axioms. For deeper discussion of the Axiom of Choice, see Rubin and Rubin [348],
Rubin and Rubin [349] and Herrlich [176]. [The book Howard and Rubin [199] is a
survey of research done during the last 100 years on the Axiom of Choice and its
consequences, and is updated on Howard [198].]

APPENDIX 6: FILTERS AND NETS

A6.1.27

Proposition.

Let f be a surjective mapping of a topological space

(X, τ ) onto a topological space (Y, τ 1 ), and for each x ∈ X , let Nx and Nf (x)
denote, respectively, the filter of neighbourhoods of x ∈ (X, τ ) and the filter of
neighbourhoods of f (x) ∈ (Y, τ 1 ). Then the following are equivalent:
(i) f is continuous;
(ii) for every x ∈ X , Nf (x) ∈ Nf (x) =⇒ f −1 (Nf (x) ) ∈ Nx ;
(iii) for every x ∈ X , f (Nx ) ⊇ Nf (x) ;
(iv) for every x ∈ X and every filter F on (X,

τ ), F → x =⇒ f (F) → f (x);

that is, F ⊇ Nx =⇒ f (F) ⊇ Nf (x) ;
(v) for every x ∈ X and every ultrafilter U on (X,

τ ), U → x =⇒ f (U) → f (x);

that is, U ⊇ Nx =⇒ f (U) ⊇ Nf (x) .

Proof.

We begin by noting that Remark A6.1.21 says that a filter F converges

to a point x if and only if F is finer than Nx .
Clearly (i) ⇔ (ii) ⇔ (iii) and (iii) =⇒ (iv) =⇒ (v).
We shall complete the proof of the Proposition by showing that (v) =⇒ (ii).
Let x ∈ X and U be any ultrafilter finer than Nx . Let
Nf (x) ∈ Nf (x) . Then Nf (x) ∈ f (U). By Examples A6.1.13(v), f −1 (Nf (x) ) ∈ U . By
Proposition A6.1.17, Nx equals the intersection of all ultrafilters containing it. As
f −1 (Nf (x) ) is in each such ultrafilter, f −1 (Nf (x) ) ∈ Nx . Thus (v) =⇒ (ii).

Assume (v) is true.

The same kind of argument used above yields the next Proposition.

be used to define continuous functions and compactness. And we have seen that
ultrafilters can be used to give an elegant and short proof of Tychonoff ’s Theorem.

A6.2

Filterbases

We have seen that it is often more convenient to describe a basis for a topology than
the topology itself. For example in R, Rn for n > 1, metric space topologies, and
product topologies there are elegant descriptions of their bases but less than elegant
descriptions of the topologies themselves. Similarly, it is often more covenient to
describe a filter basis than the filter itself. Further, we will see that it it is easy to
relate convergent filter bases to convergent sequences.

A6.2.1

Definition.

Let X be a non-empty set and G a set of non-empty

subsets of X . Then G is said to be a filterbase (or a filter basis or a filterbasis
or a filter base) if G1 , G2 ∈ G implies that there exists a G3 ∈ G such that

G3 ⊆ G1 ∩ G2 .

A6.2.2

Remarks.

Let X be a non-empty set and G a filterbase on X . Then

(i) clearly Ø ∈

(ii) every filter on X is also a filterbase on X ;
(iii) G has the finite intersection property;
(iv) the set F = {F ⊆ X : F ⊇ G, G ∈ G} is a filter, indeed it is the coarsest filter,
containing G and it is called the filter generated by G ;
(v) if X is a set and x ∈ X , then G = {x} is a filterbase on X ;
(vi) if X has more than one point, then F = {{x} : x ∈ X} is not a filterbase or a
filter. Indeed, if x and y are distinct points of X , then a filter or filterbasis F
cannot contain both of the sets {x} and {y}.
(vii) If A is a set of non-empty subsets of X and A has the finite intersection property,
then there exists a filterbase containing A. [Verify this.]

0.
(iii) Let X be a set and xi , i ∈ N, a sequence of points in X . For each n ∈ N, let

Gn = {xj : j ∈ N and j ⩾ n}.
So each Gn is a subset of X and we define G = {Gn : n ∈ N}. Then G is a
filterbase on the set X . We call G the filterbase determined by the sequence

xi , i ∈ N,.

Let G1 and G2 be filterbases on a set X . Then (i) G1

τ ) where each F ∈ F satisfies

F ⊆ S.

Proof.

If a is a limit point of S , then each neighbourhood N of a must

intersect the set S nontrivially. Let FN = N ∩ S . Let N denote the filterbase
of neighbourhoods in (X,

τ ) of a. We claim that F = {FN : N ∈ N } is a filterbase.

Each FN is non-empty. Further if N1 , N2 ∈ N , then the set N3 = N1 ∩ N2 ∈ N .
But then as a is a limit point of S and N3 is a neighbourhood of a, we also have

FN3 = N3 ∩ S 6= Ø and FN3 = N3 ∩ S = (N1 ∩ N2 ) ∩ S = FN1 ∩ FN2 , and so FN is
indeed a filterbase. Further, from the very definition of F , we see that F → a, as
required.

643

Conversely, let F1 be a fliterbase such that F1 → a0 ∈ X , and each F ∈ F1 ,
satisfies F ⊆ S . Let N 0 be any neighbourhood of a0 . As F1 → a0 , this implies that
N 0 ⊇ F1 , for some F1 ∈ F1 . Since F1 ∈ F1 , F1 ⊆ S , and thus N 0 ∩ S 6= Ø. Hence
a0 is a limit point of S , as required.

Let (X,

(i) S is a closed set in (X,

(ii) Let F be a filterbase on (X,

τ ) such that F ∈ F implies F ⊆ S . Further,

let a ∈ X be such that F → a. Then a ∈ S for every such F and a.

A6.2.13

Remark.

We know that if (X,

τ ) is a metrizable topological space,

then a subset S of X is closed if and only if each point a in X such that a is a limit
point of a sequence s1 , s2 , . . . , sn , . . . where each sn ∈ S , satisfies a ∈ S . Noting
Example A6.2.3 which says that each sequence determines a filterbase, we see that
Corollary A6.2.12 is a generalization of this metrizable space result to arbitrary
topological spaces; that is, filterbases for arbitrary topological spaces fulfil the same
role that sequences do for metrizable spaces.

and G a filterbase on (X,
filterbase G1 on (X,

Let (X,

τ ) be a topological space, a a point in X ,

τ ). If G has a as a cluster point, then there is a

τ ) such that G1 is a refinement of G and a is a limit point

of G1 .

Proof.

For each neighbourhood U of a and each G ∈ G , let GU = G ∩ U . Define

the set G1 = {GU : U a neighbourhood of a, G ∈ G}.
Firstly we have to verify that G1 is a filterbase. Let G1 and G2 be in G1 . Then
G1 = G01 ∩ U1 and G2 = G02 ∩ U2 , where U1 and U2 are neighbourhoods of a in
(X, ), and G01 and G02 are in G . Then

τ

G1 ∩ G2 = (G01 ∩ U1 ) ∩ (G02 ∩ U2 ) = (G01 ∩ G02 ) ∩ (U1 ∩ U2 ).
As G is a filterbase, there exists a G03 ∈ G such that G03 ⊆ G01 ∩ G02 . Since U1 and
U2 are neighbourhoods of a, U3 = U1 ∩ U2 is also a neighbourhood of a. As G03 ∈ G ,
G03 ∩ U3 ∈ G1 . Thus G1 ∩ G2 contains the set G03 ∩ U3 , which is in G1 . So G1 is
indeed a filterbase.
By the definition of G1 , it is a refinement of G .
Clearly, also by the definition of G1 , G1 → a; that is a is a limit point of G1 .

and G a filterbase on (X,

Let (X,

τ ) be a topological space, a a point in X ,

τ ). If G1 is a filterbase which is a refinement of G and

a is a cluster point of G1 , then a is a cluster point of G .

Proof.

To prove that a is a cluster point of G , let G ∈ G and let U be any

neighbourhood of a in (X,

τ ). We need to show that G ∩ U 6= Ø.

As G1 is a refinement of G , there exists a G1 ∈ G1 such that G1 ⊆ G.
Now a is a cluster point of G1 implies that G1 ∩U 6= Ø. So G∩U ⊇ G1 ∩U 6= Ø,
as required.

A6.2.19

Corollary.

Let (X,

G a filterbase on (X, τ ). Then a is a cluster point of G if and only if there is a
filterbase G1 which is a refinement of G such that a is a limit point of G1 .

Proof.

This is an immediate consequence of Propositions A6.2.17, A6.2.18 and

Remark A6.2.16(i).
We now show that filterbases can be used to characterize compact topological
spaces.

Firstly assume that (X,

τ ) is a compact space and G is a filterbase

τ ). Then the set G = {G ∈ G} has the finite intersection property by

intersection property. As (X,

G. So if U is any neighbourhood of a, U ∩ G 6= Ø. Thus we

see that a is a cluster point of the filterbase G .
To prove the converse, let (X,

has a cluster point. We shall prove compactness using Proposition 10.3.2. Let S be
any set of closed subsets of (X,

a cluster point x of the filterbase A; that is, if V is any neighbourhood of x, then

V ∩ A 6= Ø, for each A ∈ A. This implies that x is a limit point of the set A.
Noting that each A ∈ A, being a finite intersection of closed sets, is a closet set,

this implies that x ∈ A, for each A ∈ A. Hence

then f (F) is a filterbase on (Y, τ 1 ). Further, if x ∈ X and F → x, then
A6.2.22

Let (X,

Proposition.

f (F) → f (x).

Proof.

Firstly we show that f (F) is a filterbase on (Y,

τ 1). As F is a filterbase,

every set in F is non-empty and so each set f (F) is also non-empty.

Now let

G1 , G2 ∈ f (F). Then there exists F1 , F2 ∈ F such that f (F1 ) = G1 and
f (F2 ) = G2 . As F is a filterbase, by Definition A6.2.1 there exists a non-empty set
F3 ∈ F , such that F3 ⊆ F1 ∩ F2 . This implies f (F3 ) ⊂ f (F1 ) ∩ f (F2 ); that is, the
set G3 = f (F3 ) ∈ f (F) and G3 ⊆ G1 ∩ G2 . So f (F) is indeed a filterbase on (Y, τ 1 .
Now we know that f is continuous and F → x. Let U be any neighbourhood
of f (x) in (Y, 1 ). As f is continuous, f −1 (U ) is a neighbourhood of x in (X, ).
Since F → x, by Definition 6.2.7 there exists F ∈ F , such that F ⊆ f −1 (U ). So

Let x be any point in the set f −1 (U ) and Nx the neighbourhood filter at x in

(X, τ ). By Example A6.2.9, Nx → x. By assumption, f (Nx ) → f (x). As U is
open, it is a neighbourhood of f (x). So there exists a G ∈ f (Nx ) such that G ⊆ U .
However, G = f (N ), where N ∈ Nx and thus f (N ) ⊆ U . Hence the neighbourhood
N of x satisfies N ⊆ f −1 (U ).
So we have that the set f −1 (U ) contains a neighbourhood of x, for each
x ∈ f −1 (U ). Thus f −1 (U ) ia an open set, which completes the proof that f is
continuous.

Nets38

In 1922 E.H. Moore and H.L. Smith in their paper, Moore and Smith [289],
introduced the notion of a net as a generalization of a sequence.

As we shall

see, this notion is equivalent to the more elegant approach of filters introduced in
1937 by Henri Cartan (Cartan [69], Cartan [70]).
A partial order, ⩽, on a set was defined in Definitions 10.2.1. A set with a
partial order is called a partially ordered set. §10.2 gives a number of examples of
partially ordered sets.

A6.3.1

Definition.

A partially ordered set (D, ⩽) is said to be a directed

set if for any a ∈ D and b ∈ D , there exists a c ∈ D such that a ⩽ c and b ⩽ c.

A6.3.2

Examples.

It is easily seen that N, Z, Q, and R with the usual partial



order are directed sets.

A6.3.3

Example.

Let (X,

τ ) be a topological space and a a point in X . Let

D be the set of all neighbourhoods of the point a. Put a partial order ⩽ on D
by D1 ⩽ D2 if D2 ⊆ D1 , where the sets D1 , D2 ∈ D . As the intersection of two
neighbourhoods of a is a neighbourhood of a, it follows that D1 ∩ D2 ∈ D , and
D1 ∩ D2 ⩾ D1 and D1 ∩ D2 ⩾ D2 , Thus (D, ⩽) is a directed set.

At this point we discuss the equivalence of filterbases and nets.

A6.3.10

Proposition.

Let (X,

τ ) be a topological space, S a subset of X

and a a point in X . Then a is a limit point of S if and only if there is a net in

S converging to a.

Proof.

Firstly let a be a limit point of S . Define a directed set D by

D = {U : U is a neighbourhood of a} where, for U1 , U2 ∈ D, U1 ⩽ U2 if U1 ⊇ U2 .
As a is a limit point of S , U ∩ S 6= Ø, for all U ∈ D . For each U ∈ D , let aU
be an arbitary point of U ∩ S . Then {aU } is a net. If V is any neighbourhood of a,
then V ∈ D . For every U ⩾ V , aU ∈ U ⊆ V . So we have that {aU } → a.
Conversely assume that a ∈ X and {xα } → a, where xα ∈ S , for α in a directed
set D . Let U be any neighbourhood of a. Then there exists a β ∈ D , such that

β ⩽ γ =⇒ xγ ∈ U . So U ∩ S 6= Ø. Thus a is a limit point of S , as required.

APPENDIX 6: FILTERS AND NETS

Now we define the notion of a subnet, which is a generalization of that of a
subsequence. However, it is slightly more technical than one might at first expect.
This extra technicality is needed in order that certain properties of subnets that we
want will be true.

A6.3.20

Definitions.

Let X be a set, D1 and D2 directed sets, and

φ1 : D1 → X and φ2 : D2 → X nets in X . A function θ : D2 → D1 is
said to be non-decreasing if β1 ⩽ β2 =⇒ θ(β1 ) ⩽ θ(β2 ), for all β1 , β2 ∈ D2 .
The function θ is said to be cofinal if for each α ∈ D1 , there exists a β ∈ D2
such that θ(β) ⩾ α. The net φ2 is said to be a subnet of the net φ1 if there
exists a non-decreasing cofinal function θ : D2 → D1 such that φ2 = φ1 ◦ θ .

A6.3.21

Remark.

In the literature there are two inequivalent definitions of

subnet. As well as that used in Definitions A6.3.20, another definition does not
include that θ is non-decreasing but rather only that it is cofinal.

A6.3.22

Example.



Let D1 = D2 = N with the usual ordering, let θ : N → N

τ ) any topological space. Clearly θ is a
non-decreasing cofinal map. So if x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . . is any sequence in (X, τ ) then
be given by θ(n) = 3n, for n ∈ N, and (X,

it is also a net with directed set N and the subsequence x3 , x6 , . . . , x3n , . . . is also a



subnet.

Let D1 = D2 = N with the usual ordering, let θ : N → N
be given by θ(n) = 1 + [ n
2 ], n ∈ N, where [x] denotes the integer part of
x, for example [ 53 ] = 1, [4.9] = 4, [5] = 5. The map θ is non-decreasing
A6.3.23

Example.

and cofinal.

So the sequence and net x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . . in (X,

τ ) has a subnet

x1 , x2 , x2 , x3 , x3 , x4 , x4 , x5 , . . . , x1+[ n ] , . . . which is not a subsequence. So while

every subsequence of a sequence is a subnet, not every subnet of a sequence is
a subsequence.

Let

integers.

Consider the directed sets D1 = N and D2 = (1, ∞), with the usual

orderings. Let φ1 : N → X be the identity map and θ : (1, ∞) → N be given by

θ(x) = [x], the integer part of x, x ∈ (1, ∞). Let φ2 : (1, ∞) → X be defined by
φ2 = φ1 ◦ θ. Clearly φ1 and φ2 are nets in X and φ2 is a subnet of φ1 by its very
definition.
It is interesting to note that the directed set D1 = N is a countable set, while
the directed set D2 = (1, ∞) is an uncountable set.

In other words, if we put

xn = φ1 (n), n ∈ N and xr = φ2 (r), for r ∈ (1, ∞), then the uncountable net {xr },
r ∈ (1, ∞), is a subnet of the countable sequence (and net) {xn }, n ∈ N.

a partial ordering on D2 by (α1 , U1 ) ⩽ (α2 , U2 ) when α1 ⩽ α2 and U1 ⊇ U2 . We
claim that D2 is a directed set. To see this let (α1 , U1 ) ∈ D2 and (α2 , U2 ) ∈ D2 .
As α1 , α2 ∈ D1 and D1 is a directed set, there exists an α3 ∈ D1 with α1 ⩽ α3
and α2 ⩽ α3 . Put U3 = U1 ∩ U2 , so that we have U1 ⊇ U3 and U2 ⊇ U3 . As a
is a cluster point and a ∈ U3 , there exist an α4 with α3 ⩽ α4 such that xα4 ∈ U3 .
So (α4 , U3 ) ∈ D2 . As α1 ⩽ α4 , α2 ⩽ α4 , U1 ⊇ U3 and U2 ⊇ U3 , we see that

(α1 , U1 ) ⩽ (α4 , U3 ) and (α2 , U2 ) ⩽ (α4 , U3 ). So D2 is indeed a directed set.
Define a map θ : D2 → D1 by θ(α, U ) = α, where α ∈ D1 and U is a
neighbourhood of a. Clearly θ is non-decreasing. Now consider any α ∈ D1 . As a is
a cluster point, for any neighbourhood U of a, there exists a γ ∈ D1 with α ⩽ γ such
that xγ ∈ U . So (γ, U ) ∈ D2 and we have θ((γ, U )) = γ and α ⩽ γ . So θ is also
cofinal. For notational convenience, write φ : D1 → X where φ(α) = xα , α ∈ D1 .
Then φ ◦ θ : D2 → X is a subnet of the net {xα }, α ∈ D1 .
As a is a cluster point of the net {xα }, α ∈ D1 , for each neighbourhood U0 of

a and each α0 ∈ D1 , there exists a β ∈ D1 , α0 ⩽ β such that xβ ∈ U0 . Then by
the definition of D2 , for any (α, U ) ∈ D2 with (β, U0 ) ⩽ (α, U ) we have xα ∈ U and
U ⊆ U0 . So xα ∈ U0 . In other words, φ ◦ θ(α, U ) ⊆ U0 , for all (β, U0 ) ⩽ (α, U ) ;
that is the subnet φ ◦ θ converges to a.
The converse follows immediately from Propositions A6.3.26 and A6.3.27.

A6.4 Wallman Compactifications: An Application of Ultrafilters
Repeatedly throughout the study of topology we are interested in whether a given
topological space can be embedded as a subspace of a topological space with nicer
properties. In metric space theory we know that not every metric space is complete.
But can every metric space be embedded as a metric subspace of a complete metric
space? The answer is “yes”, and was proved in Proposition 6.3.23.
This was achieved by first recognizing that a metric space is complete if and only
if every Cauchy sequence converges. So a metric space which fails to be complete
must have Cauchy sequences which are not convergent. For example in Q with the
euclidean metric, we easily find Cauchy sequences of rational numbers which do not
converge (to any rational number).
So we need to enlarge the metric space with extra points so that the Cauchy
sequences which did not converge previously now converge to one of the extra
points. In the case of Q, we add what is effectively the irrational numbers, and the
completion is R.
So the “trick” or rather the “technique”, is to identify why the given topological
space fails to have the desired property and then add extra points in such a way that
the topological space with the extra points does have the desired property.

660

APPENDIX 6: FILTERS AND NETS

In 1937 M.H. Stone and E. C̆ech introduced what is now known as the StoneC̆ech compactification which is defined in Definition 10.4.1. They showed that a
topological space can be embedded as a subspace of a compact Hausdorff space if
and only if it is completely regular and Hausdorff, that is it is a Tychonoff space.
This is discussed in §10.4.
In 1938 H. Wallman (Wallmani [418]) proved that a topological space can be
embedded as a subspace of a compact T1 -space if and only of it is a T1 -space.
We shall now describe the Wallman compactification. If we are given a T1 -space
which is not compact, how can we enlarge the space to obtain a compact T1 -space?
To answer this we find a convenient property for testing compactness. We know
several such properties. We look for one which is most convenient. As indicated in
the title of this section, we shall use ultrafilters.
Note Proposition 10.3.2 states that a topological space (X,

τ ) is compact if and

only if for every family F of closed subsets of X with the finite intersection (F.I.P.)
property (see Definition 10.3.1)

T

F 6= Ø.

F ∈F
So we shall focus our intention on families of closed sets with the finite
intersection property. Now we know that filters and ultrafilters, in particular, have
the F.I.P. But, in almost all topological spaces, families of closed sets cannot form
a filter, since any set which contains a set in the filter is also in the filter.
Therefore we shall modify the notion of an ultrafilter so that the modification
still has all the desired properties of an ultrafilter but can consist of only closed sets.

A6.4.1

Definitions.

Let (X,

τ ) be a topological space and C the set of all

closed subsets of X . A non-empty subset F of C is said to be a filter in C if
(i) F1 , F2 ∈ F implies F1 ∩ F2 ∈ F ;
(ii) F ∈ F and F ⊆ G ∈ C =⇒ G ∈ F ; and
(iii) Ø ∈
/ F.
A filter U in C is said to be an ultrafilter in C if no filter in C is strictly finer
than U .
An ultrafilter U in C is said to be a free ultrafilter in C if

T
U ∈U

U = Ø.

661

We record some useful facts about ultrafilters in the set of all closed sets, C , on
a topological space (X,

τ ).

The proof of Proposition A6.4.2 is analagous to that of The Ultrafilter Lemma
A6.1.10 and Corollary A6.1.12.

Indeed if S is a non-empty set of closed subsets of X and S has the F.I.P., then
there is an ultrafilter U in C such that S ⊆ U .

If U is any ultrafilter in C , then it has the finite interesection property. If U is

set of all free ultrafilters in C . We shall expand the space (X, τ ) by adding extra

a free ultrafilter, then (X,

“points” using these free ultrafilters.

Let ωX be the set X ∪ F.
A6.4.4

Remarks.

So each point in ωX is either a point in X or a free ultrafilter

in C . At first sight this might appear strange, but a set is just a collection of objects.
In this case there are two kinds of objects in ωX , namely points and free ultrafilters
in C .
Our task is to define a topology on ωX in such a way that it has (X,

τ ) as a

subspace, and that with this topology ωX is a compact T1 -space.
For each open subset O of (X, ), define the subset O ∗ of ωX by

τ

O∗ = O ∪ {U ∈ F : X \ O ∈
/ U}.

(1)

Then X ∗ = X ∪ {U ∈ F : Ø ∈
/ U} = X ∪ F = ωX and O∗ = Ø ⇐⇒ O = Ø. (2)
For each closed subset A of (X,

τ ), define the subset A∗ of ωX by

A∗ = A ∪ {U ∈ F : A ∈ U}.

(3)

Then X∗ = X ∪ {U ∈ F : X ∈ U} = X ∪ F = ωX and A∗ = Ø ⇐⇒ A = Ø. (4)
Noting that (X,

τ ) is a T1-space, for x ∈ X , {x} is a closed set in (X, τ ) and

so

{x}∗ = {x} ∪ {U ∈ F : {x} ∈ U} = {x} ∪ Ø = {x}

τ } is a basis for a topology τ ω on ωX
and that this topological space (ωX, τ ω ) is a compact T1 -space which has
(X, τ ) as a subspace.
We shall show that B = {O ∗ : O ∈

APPENDIX 6: FILTERS AND NETS

We claim that for any O ∈

τ

O∗ = ωX \ (X \ O)∗ .

(6)

Proof of (6).

ωX \ (X \ O)∗ = (X ∪ F) \ ((X \ O) ∪ {U ∈ F : X \ O ∈ U}), by (3)
= (X \ (X \ O)) ∪ (F \ {U ∈ F : X \ O ∈ U})
= O ∪ {U ∈ F : X \ O ∈

= O∗ , by (1), which completes the proof.
Similary for any closed set A in (X,



τ ), we can show that

A∗ = ωX \ (X \ A)∗ .

(7)

We claim that for any A1 , A2 ∈ C ,

(A1 ∩ A2 )∗ = A1 ∗ ∩ A2 ∗ .

(8)

Proof of (8).

A1 ∗ ∩ A2 ∗ = (A1 ∪ {U ∈ F : A1 ∈ U}) ∩ (A2 ∪ {U ∈ F : A2 ∈ U}), by (3)
= (A1 ∩ A2 ) ∪ {U ∈ F : A1 , A2 ∈ U}
= (A1 ∩ A2 ) ∪ {U ∈ F : A1 ∩ A2 ∈ U}, by Proposition A6.4.3(ii)
= (A1 ∩ A2 )∗ , by (3), which completes the proof



Similarly we can show that

(A1 ∪ A2 )∗ = A1 ∗ ∪ A2 ∗ .
We claim that for O1 , O2 ∈

(9)

τ

(O1 ∪ O2 )∗ = O1 ∗ ∪ O2 ∗ .

(10)

(10) follows from (6) and (3) and so its proof is left as an exercise.
We also leave the proof of (11) as an exercise.

(O1 ∩ O2 )∗ = O1 ∗ ∩ O2 ∗ .

(11)

As a consequence of (8) and the second part of (4) we obtain
Let A1 , A2 , . . . , An ∈ C.

It follows immediately from (12) that for Ai ∈ C, i ∈ I , any index set,

{Ai : i ∈ I} has the F.I.P. ⇐⇒ {Ai ∗ : i ∈ I} has the F.I.P..

(13)

Now by Proposition 2.2.8, (11) and (2) imply that the set B = {O ∗ : O ∈

τ } is

τ ω on ωX . So every open set in (ωX, τ ω ) is a union
of members of B . Every closed set in (ωX, τ ω ) is therefore an intersection of closed
sets A∗ , where A is closed in (X, τ ).

Hausdorff space (K, τ 1 ) extends to a continuous map of (ωX, τ ω ) into (K, τ 1 ).

compactification (ωX,

τ ) is a subspace of (ωX, τ ω ) follows immediately from
the definitions of ωX , B , τ ω , and O ∗ , for O ∈ τ . That X is dense in (ωX, τ ω )
follows immediately from the the definition of the basic open sets O ∗ , O ∈ τ , as
Proof.

The fact that (X,

each (non-empty) O ∗ intersects X non-trivially.
Next we shall prove that (ωX,

τ ω ) is a T1-space, that is each point is a closed

set. We know that there are two kinds of points in ωX , namely x ∈ X and U ,
where U ∈ F. By (4) above each {x} = {x}∗ and so is a closed set in (ωX,

τ ω ).

Noting that if U, F ∈ F are distinct ultrafilters, there exists A ∈ U such that A ∈
/ F,
because otherwise F would be a finer filter in C than U , which contradicts U being
an ultrafilter in C . Therefore

\

{F ∈ F : A ∈ F} = {U}.

(14)

A∈U
Using (14), the fact that U is a free ultrafilter in C , and (3) which says that

A∗ = A ∪ {F ∈ F : A ∈ F} we obtain that

[ \

{F ∈ F : A ∈ F} = (Ø) ∪ ({U}) = {U}.

Thus U is the intersection of the closed sets A∗ , A ∈ U , and so is a closed set. So
we have that every {x} and every U is a closed set in (ωX,

τ ω ). Thus (ωX, τ ω ) is

indeed a T1 -space.
Finally, we need to show that (ωX,

τ ω ) is compact. Let I be an index set and

{Ci : i ∈ I} a set of closed subsets of ωX with the F.I.P. We are required to prove
T
that
Ci 6= Ø.

As noted earlier, each Ci =
(Aij )∗ , for some index set J , where each Aij
j∈J
is a closed subset of X . Therefore {(Aij )∗ : i ∈ I, j ∈ J} has the F.I.P.. By (12)

667

this implies that {Aij : i ∈ I, j ∈ J} has the F.I.P.. So by Proposition A6.4.2 there
exists an ultrafilter U in C containing {Aij : i ∈ I, j ∈ J}.

subsets of (K, 1 ). As φ : (X, ) → (K, 1 ) is continuous, φ−1 (C1 ) and φ−1 (C2 )
are disjoint closed subsets of (X, ). So by (8) and (2), [φ−1 (C1 )]∗ and [φ−1 (C2 )]∗
are disjoint closed subsets of (ωX, ω ). As [φ−1 (C1 )]∗ is a closed set containing
φ−1 (C1 ) and [φ−1 (C1 )]∗ is a closed set containing φ−1 (C2 ), the closures in ωX of
φ−1 (C1 ) and φ−1 (C2 ) are disjoint. By Proposition 10.3.53, φ : (X, ) → (K, 1 )

(C2 )∗ are disjoint closed sets in the normal space (ωX, τ ω ). So there exist disjoint
O1 , O2 ∈ τ ω , such that (C1 )∗ ⊆ O1 and (C2 )∗ ⊆ O2 . Then the disjoint sets O1 ∩ X
