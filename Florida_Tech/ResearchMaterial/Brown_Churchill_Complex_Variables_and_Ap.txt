PREFACE

This book is a revision of the seventh edition, which was published in 2004. That
edition has served, just as the earlier ones did, as a textbook for a one-term introductory course in the theory and application of functions of a complex variable.
This new edition preserves the basic content and style of the earlier editions, the
first two of which were written by the late Ruel V. Churchill alone.
The first objective of the book is to develop those parts of the theory that are
prominent in applications of the subject. The second objective is to furnish an introduction to applications of residues and conformal mapping. With regard to residues,
special emphasis is given to their use in evaluating real improper integrals, finding
inverse Laplace transforms, and locating zeros of functions. As for conformal mapping, considerable attention is paid to its use in solving boundary value problems
that arise in studies of heat conduction and fluid flow. Hence the book may be
considered as a companion volume to the authors’ text “Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems,” where another classical method for solving boundary value
problems in partial differential equations is developed.
The first nine chapters of this book have for many years formed the basis of a
three-hour course given each term at The University of Michigan. The classes have
consisted mainly of seniors and graduate students concentrating in mathematics,
engineering, or one of the physical sciences. Before taking the course, the students
have completed at least a three-term calculus sequence and a first course in ordinary
differential equations. Much of the material in the book need not be covered in the
lectures and can be left for self-study or used for reference. If mapping by elementary
functions is desired earlier in the course, one can skip to Chap. 8 immediately after
Chap. 3 on elementary functions.
In order to accommodate as wide a range of readers as possible, there are footnotes referring to other texts that give proofs and discussions of the more delicate
results from calculus and advanced calculus that are occasionally needed. A bibliography of other books on complex variables, many of which are more advanced,
is provided in Appendix 1. A table of conformal transformations that are useful in
applications appears in Appendix 2.

The main changes in this edition appear in the first nine chapters. Many of
those changes have been suggested by users of the last edition. Some readers have
urged that sections which can be skipped or postponed without disruption be more
clearly identified. The statements of Taylor’s theorem and Laurent’s theorem, for
example, now appear in sections that are separate from the sections containing
their proofs. Another significant change involves the extended form of the Cauchy
integral formula for derivatives. The treatment of that extension has been completely
rewritten, and its immediate consequences are now more focused and appear together
in a single section.
Other improvements that seemed necessary include more details in arguments
involving mathematical induction, a greater emphasis on rules for using complex
exponents, some discussion of residues at infinity, and a clearer exposition of real
improper integrals and their Cauchy principal values. In addition, some rearrangement of material was called for. For instance, the discussion of upper bounds of
moduli of integrals is now entirely in one section, and there is a separate section
devoted to the definition and illustration of isolated singular points. Exercise sets
occur more frequently than in earlier editions and, as a result, concentrate more
directly on the material at hand.
Finally, there is an Student’s Solutions Manual (ISBN: 978-0-07-333730-2;
MHID: 0-07-333730-7) that is available upon request to instructors who adopt the
book. It contains solutions of selected exercises in Chapters 1 through 7, covering
the material through residues.
In the preparation of this edition, continual interest and support has been provided by a variety of people, especially the staff at McGraw-Hill and my wife
Jacqueline Read Brown.

CHAPTER

1
COMPLEX NUMBERS

In this chapter, we survey the algebraic and geometric structure of the complex
number system. We assume various corresponding properties of real numbers to be
known.

1. SUMS AND PRODUCTS
Complex numbers can be defined as ordered pairs (x, y) of real numbers that are to
be interpreted as points in the complex plane, with rectangular coordinates x and y,
just as real numbers x are thought of as points on the real line. When real numbers
x are displayed as points (x, 0) on the real axis, it is clear that the set of complex
numbers includes the real numbers as a subset. Complex numbers of the form (0, y)
correspond to points on the y axis and are called pure imaginary numbers when
y = 0. The y axis is then referred to as the imaginary axis.
It is customary to denote a complex number (x, y) by z, so that (see Fig. 1)
(1)

z = (x, y).

The real numbers x and y are, moreover, known as the real and imaginary parts of
z, respectively; and we write
(2)

x = Re z, y = Im z.

Two complex numbers z1 and z2 are equal whenever they have the same real parts
and the same imaginary parts. Thus the statement z1 = z2 means that z1 and z2
correspond to the same point in the complex, or z, plane.

FIGURE 1

The sum z1 + z2 and product z1 z2 of two complex numbers
z1 = (x1 , y1 ) and z2 = (x2 , y2 )
are defined as follows:
(3)
(4)

(x1 , y1 ) + (x2 , y2 ) = (x1 + x2 , y1 + y2 ),
(x1 , y1 )(x2 , y2 ) = (x1 x2 − y1 y2 , y1 x2 + x1 y2 ).

Note that the operations defined by equations (3) and (4) become the usual operations
of addition and multiplication when restricted to the real numbers:
(x1 , 0) + (x2 , 0) = (x1 + x2 , 0),
(x1 , 0)(x2 , 0) = (x1 x2 , 0).
The complex number system is, therefore, a natural extension of the real number
system.
Any complex number z = (x, y) can be written z = (x, 0) + (0, y), and it is
easy to see that (0, 1)(y, 0) = (0, y). Hence
z = (x, 0) + (0, 1)(y, 0);
and if we think of a real number as either x or (x, 0) and let i denote the pure
imaginary number (0,1), as shown in Fig. 1, it is clear that∗
(5)

z = x + iy.

Also, with the convention that z2 = zz, z3 = z2 z, etc., we have
i 2 = (0, 1)(0, 1) = (−1, 0),
or
(6)

i 2 = −1.

∗ In electrical engineering, the letter j is used instead of i.

Basic Algebraic Properties

10/29/07

3

Because (x, y) = x + iy, definitions (3) and (4) become
(7)
(8)

(x1 + iy1 ) + (x2 + iy2 ) = (x1 + x2 ) + i(y1 + y2 ),
(x1 + iy1 )(x2 + iy2 ) = (x1 x2 − y1 y2 ) + i(y1 x2 + x1 y2 ).

Observe that the right-hand sides of these equations can be obtained by formally
manipulating the terms on the left as if they involved only real numbers and by
replacing i 2 by −1 when it occurs. Also, observe how equation (8) tells us that any
complex number times zero is zero. More precisely,
z · 0 = (x + iy)(0 + i0) = 0 + i0 = 0
for any z = x + iy.

2. BASIC ALGEBRAIC PROPERTIES
Various properties of addition and multiplication of complex numbers are the same
as for real numbers. We list here the more basic of these algebraic properties and
verify some of them. Most of the others are verified in the exercises.
The commutative laws
z1 + z2 = z2 + z1 ,

(1)

z1 z2 = z2 z1

and the associative laws
(2)

(z1 + z2 ) + z3 = z1 + (z2 + z3 ),

(z1 z2 )z3 = z1 (z2 z3 )

follow easily from the definitions in Sec. 1 of addition and multiplication of complex
numbers and the fact that real numbers obey these laws. For example, if
z1 = (x1 , y1 )

and z2 = (x2 , y2 ),

then
z1 + z2 = (x1 + x2 , y1 + y2 ) = (x2 + x1 , y2 + y1 ) = z2 + z1 .
Verification of the rest of the above laws, as well as the distributive law
(3)

z(z1 + z2 ) = zz1 + zz2 ,

is similar.
According to the commutative law for multiplication, iy = yi. Hence one can
write z = x + yi instead of z = x + iy. Also, because of the associative laws, a
sum z1 + z2 + z3 or a product z1 z2 z3 is well defined without parentheses, as is the
case with real numbers.

Complex Numbers

chap. 1

The additive identity 0 = (0, 0) and the multiplicative identity 1 = (1, 0) for
real numbers carry over to the entire complex number system. That is,
z+0=z

(4)

and z · 1 = z

for every complex number z. Furthermore, 0 and 1 are the only complex numbers
with such properties (see Exercise 8).
There is associated with each complex number z = (x, y) an additive inverse
−z = (−x, −y),

(5)

satisfying the equation z + (−z) = 0. Moreover, there is only one additive inverse
for any given z, since the equation
(x, y) + (u, v) = (0, 0)
implies that
u = −x

and v = −y.

For any nonzero complex number z = (x, y), there is a number z−1 such that
zz = 1. This multiplicative inverse is less obvious than the additive one. To find
it, we seek real numbers u and v, expressed in terms of x and y, such that
−1

(x, y)(u, v) = (1, 0).
According to equation (4), Sec. 1, which defines the product of two complex numbers, u and v must satisfy the pair
xu − yv = 1,

yu + xv = 0

of linear simultaneous equations; and simple computation yields the unique solution
u=

x
x2 + y2

,

v=

−y
x2 + y2

.

So the multiplicative inverse of z = (x, y) is
(6)

z

−1


=

x
−y
,
x2 + y2 x2 + y2


(z = 0).

The inverse z−1 is not defined when z = 0. In fact, z = 0 means that x 2 + y 2 = 0 ;
and this is not permitted in expression (6).

Complex Numbers

chap. 1

in Sec. 2. Inasmuch as such properties continue to be anticipated because they
also apply to real numbers, the reader can easily pass to Sec. 4 without serious
disruption.
We begin with the observation that the existence of multiplicative inverses
enables us to show that if a product z1 z2 is zero, then so is at least one of the factors
z1 and z2 . For suppose that z1 z2 = 0 and z1 = 0. The inverse z1−1 exists; and any
complex number times zero is zero (Sec. 1). Hence
z2 = z2 · 1 = z2 (z1 z1−1 ) = (z1−1 z1 )z2 = z1−1 (z1 z2 ) = z1−1 · 0 = 0.
That is, if z1 z2 = 0, either z1 = 0 or z2 = 0; or possibly both of the numbers z1 and
z2 are zero. Another way to state this result is that if two complex numbers z1 and
z2 are nonzero, then so is their product z1 z2 .
Subtraction and division are defined in terms of additive and multiplicative
inverses:
(1)

z1 − z2 = z1 + (−z2 ),

(2)

z1
= z1 z2−1
z2

(z2 = 0).

Thus, in view of expressions (5) and (6) in Sec. 2,
(3)
and
(4)

z1 − z2 = (x1 , y1 ) + (−x2 , −y2 ) = (x1 − x2 , y1 − y2 )

(z2 = 0)

when z1 = (x1 , y1 ) and z2 = (x2 , y2 ).
Using z1 = x1 + iy1 and z2 = x2 + iy2 , one can write expressions (3) and (4)
here as
(5)

z1 − z2 = (x1 − x2 ) + i(y1 − y2 )

6. Verify
(a) the associative law for addition of complex numbers, stated at the beginning of
Sec. 2;
(b) the distributive law (3), Sec. 2.
7. Use the associative law for addition and the distributive law to show that
z(z1 + z2 + z3 ) = zz1 + zz2 + zz3 .
8. (a) Write (x, y) + (u, v) = (x, y) and point out how it follows that the complex number 0 = (0, 0) is unique as an additive identity.
(b) Likewise, write (x, y)(u, v) = (x, y) and show that the number 1 = (1, 0) is a
unique multiplicative identity.
9. Use −1 = (−1, 0) and z = (x, y) to show that (−1)z = −z.
10. Use i = (0, 1) and y = (y, 0) to verify that −(iy) = (−i)y. Thus show that the additive inverse of a complex number z = x + iy can be written −z = −x − iy without
ambiguity.
11. Solve the equation z2 + z + 1 = 0 for z = (x, y) by writing
(x, y)(x, y) + (x, y) + (1, 0) = (0, 0)
and then solving a pair of simultaneous equations in x and y.
Suggestion: Use the fact that no real number x satisfies the given equation to
show that y = 0.

Also, by observing that (see Exercise 3)
(z1 z2 )(z1−1 z2−1 ) = (z1 z1−1 )(z2 z2−1 ) = 1

(z1 = 0, z2 = 0),

and hence that z1−1 z2−1 = (z1 z2 )−1 , one can use relation (9) to show that

4. VECTORS AND MODULI
It is natural to associate any nonzero complex number z = x + iy with the directed
line segment, or vector, from the origin to the point (x, y) that represents z in the
complex plane. In fact, we often refer to z as the point z or the vector z. In Fig. 2
the numbers z = x + iy and −2 + i are displayed graphically as both points and
radius vectors.

When z1 = x1 + iy1 and z2 = x2 + iy2 , the sum
z1 + z2 = (x1 + x2 ) + i(y1 + y2 )
corresponds to the point (x1 + x2 , y1 + y2 ). It also corresponds to a vector with
those coordinates as its components. Hence z1 + z2 may be obtained vectorially as
shown in Fig. 3.

Although the product of two complex numbers z1 and z2 is itself a complex
number represented by a vector, that vector lies in the same plane as the vectors for
z1 and z2 . Evidently, then, this product is neither the scalar nor the vector product
used in ordinary vector analysis.

Complex Numbers

chap. 1

The vector interpretation of complex numbers is especially helpful in extending
the concept of absolute values of real numbers to the complex plane. The modulus,
or absolute value, of a complex number z = x + iy is defined as the nonnegative
real number x 2 + y 2 and is denoted by |z|; that is,
|z| =

(1)

x2 + y2.

Geometrically, the number |z| is the distance between the point (x, y) and
the origin, or the length of the radius vector representing z. It reduces to the usual
absolute value in the real number system when y = 0. Note that while the inequality
z1 < z2 is meaningless unless both z1 and z2 are real, the statement |z1 | < |z2 |
means that the point z1 is closer to the origin than the point z2 is.
√
√
EXAMPLE 1. Since |− 3 + 2i| = 13 and |1 + 4i| = 17, we know that
the point −3 + 2i is closer to the origin than 1 + 4i is.
The distance between two points (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ) is |z1 − z2 |. This is
clear from Fig. 4, since |z1 − z2 | is the length of the vector representing the
number
z1 − z2 = z1 + (−z2 );
and, by translating the radius vector z1 − z2 , one can interpret z1 − z2 as the directed
line segment from the point (x2 , y2 ) to the point (x1 , y1 ). Alternatively, it follows
from the expression
z1 − z2 = (x1 − x2 ) + i(y1 − y2 )
and definition (1) that
|z1 − z2 | =

(x1 − x2 )2 + (y1 − y2 )2 .

The complex numbers z corresponding to the points lying on the circle with
center z0 and radius R thus satisfy the equation |z − z0 | = R, and conversely. We
refer to this set of points simply as the circle |z − z0 | = R.
EXAMPLE 2. The equation |z − 1 + 3i| = 2 represents the circle whose
center is z0 = (1, −3) and whose radius is R = 2.

It also follows from definition (1) that the real numbers |z|, Re z = x, and
Im z = y are related by the equation
|z|2 = (Re z)2 + (Im z)2 .

(2)
Thus

Re z ≤ |Re z| ≤ |z|

(3)

and

Im z ≤ |Im z| ≤ |z|.

We turn now to the triangle inequality, which provides an upper bound for the
modulus of the sum of two complex numbers z1 and z2 :
|z1 + z2 | ≤ |z1 | + |z2 |.

(4)

This important inequality is geometrically evident in Fig. 3, since it is merely a
statement that the length of one side of a triangle is less than or equal to the sum of
the lengths of the other two sides. We can also see from Fig. 3 that inequality (4)
is actually an equality when 0, z1 , and z2 are collinear. Another, strictly algebraic,
derivation is given in Exercise 15, Sec. 5.
An immediate consequence of the triangle inequality is the fact that
|z1 + z2 | ≥ ||z1 | − |z2 ||.

(5)

To derive inequality (5), we write
|z1 | = |(z1 + z2 ) + (−z2 )| ≤ |z1 + z2 | + |− z2 |,
which means that
(6)

|z1 + z2 | ≥ |z1 | − |z2 |.

This is inequality (5) when |z1 | ≥ |z2 |. If |z1 | < |z2 |, we need only interchange z1
and z2 in inequality (6) to arrive at
|z1 + z2 | ≥ −(|z1 | − |z2 |),
which is the desired result. Inequality (5) tells us, of course, that the length of one
side of a triangle is greater than or equal to the difference of the lengths of the other
two sides.
Because |− z2 | = |z2 |, one can replace z2 by −z2 in inequalities (4) and (5) to
summarize these results in a particularly useful form:
(7)

|z1 ± z2 | ≤ |z1 | + |z2 |,

(8)

|z1 ± z2 | ≥ ||z1 | − |z2 ||.

When combined, inequalities (7) and (8) become
(9)

||z1 | − |z2 || ≤ |z1 ± z2 | ≤ |z1 | + |z2 |.

EXAMPLE 3. If a point z lies on the unit circle |z| = 1 about the origin, it
follows from inequalities (7) and (8) that
|z − 2| ≤ |z| + 2 = 3
and
|z − 2| ≥ ||z| − 2| = 1.
The triangle inequality (4) can be generalized by means of mathematical induction to sums involving any finite number of terms:
(10)

|z1 + z2 + · · · + zn | ≤ |z1 | + |z2 | + · · · + |zn |

(n = 2, 3, . . .).

To give details of the induction proof here, we note that when n = 2, inequality
(10) is just inequality (4). Furthermore, if inequality (10) is assumed to be valid
when n = m, it must also hold when n = m + 1 since, by inequality (4),
|(z1 + z2 + · · · + zm ) + zm+1 | ≤ |z1 + z2 + · · · + zm | + |zm+1 |
≤ (|z1 | + |z2 | + · · · + |zm |) + |zm+1 |.

5. COMPLEX CONJUGATES
The complex conjugate, or simply the conjugate, of a complex number z = x + iy
is defined as the complex number x − iy and is denoted by z ; that is,
z = x − iy.

(1)

The number z is represented by the point (x, −y), which is the reflection in the real
axis of the point (x, y) representing z (Fig. 5). Note that
z=z

and |z| = |z|

for all z.

If z1 = x1 + iy1 and z2 = x2 + iy2 , then
z1 + z2 = (x1 + x2 ) − i(y1 + y2 ) = (x1 − iy1 ) + (x2 − iy2 ).
So the conjugate of the sum is the sum of the conjugates:
z1 + z2 = z1 + z2 .

(2)

In like manner, it is easy to show that

z1 − z2 = z1 − z2 ,

An important identity relating the conjugate of a complex number z = x + iy
to its modulus is
z z = |z|2 ,

(7)

where each side is equal to x 2 + y 2 . It suggests the method for determining a
quotient z1 /z2 that begins with expression (7), Sec. 3. That method is, of course,
based on multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of z1 /z2 by z2 , so
that the denominator becomes the real number |z2 |2 .

and recalling that a modulus is never negative. Property (9) can be verified in a
similar way.
EXAMPLE 2. Property (8) tells us that |z2 | = |z|2 and |z3 | = |z|3 . Hence if
z is a point inside the circle centered at the origin with radius 2, so that |z| < 2, it
follows from the generalized triangle inequality (10) in Sec. 4 that
|z3 + 3z2 − 2z + 1| ≤ |z|3 + 3|z|2 + 2|z| + 1 < 25.

6. EXPONENTIAL FORM
Let r and θ be polar coordinates of the point (x, y) that corresponds to a nonzero
complex number z = x + iy. Since x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ , the number z can
be written in polar form as
z = r(cos θ + i sin θ ).

(1)

If z = 0, the coordinate θ is undefined; and so it is understood that z = 0 whenever
polar coordinates are used.
In complex analysis, the real number r is not allowed to be negative and is the
length of the radius vector for z ; that is, r = |z|. The real number θ represents the
angle, measured in radians, that z makes with the positive real axis when z is interpreted as a radius vector (Fig. 6). As in calculus, θ has an infinite number of possible
values, including negative ones, that differ by integral multiples of 2π. Those values
can be determined from the equation tan θ = y/x, where the quadrant containing the
point corresponding to z must be specified. Each value of θ is called an argument
of z, and the set of all such values is denoted by arg z. The principal value of arg z,
denoted by Arg z, is that unique value  such that −π <  ≤ π. Evidently, then,
arg z = Arg z + 2nπ

(2)

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

Also, when z is a negative real number, Arg z has value π, not −π.

It must be emphasized that because of the restriction −π <  ≤ π of the principal
argument , it is not true that Arg(−1 − i) = 5π/4.
According to equation (2),
arg(−1 − i) = −

3π
+ 2nπ
4

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

Note that the term Arg z on the right-hand side of equation (2) can be replaced by
any particular value of arg z and that one can write, for instance,
arg(−1 − i) =

5π
+ 2nπ
4

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

The symbol eiθ , or exp(iθ ), is defined by means of Euler’s formula as
eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ,

(3)

where θ is to be measured in radians. It enables one to write the polar form (1)
more compactly in exponential form as
z = reiθ .

(4)

The choice of the symbol eiθ will be fully motivated later on in Sec. 29. Its use in
Sec. 7 will, however, suggest that it is a natural choice.

EXAMPLE 2.

Note how expression (4) with r = 1 tells us that the numbers eiθ lie on the
circle centered at the origin with radius unity, as shown in Fig. 7. Values of eiθ
are, then, immediate from that figure, without reference to Euler’s formula. It is, for
instance, geometrically obvious that
eiπ = −1,

e−iπ/2 = −i,

and e−i4π = 1.

Note, too, that the equation
z = Reiθ

(0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π)

is a parametric representation of the circle |z| = R, centered at the origin with radius
R. As the parameter θ increases from θ = 0 to θ = 2π, the point z starts from the
positive real axis and traverses the circle once in the counterclockwise direction.
More generally, the circle |z − z0 | = R, whose center is z0 and whose radius is R,
has the parametric representation
z = z0 + Reiθ

(8)

(0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π).

This can be seen vectorially (Fig. 8) by noting that a point z traversing the circle
|z − z0 | = R once in the counterclockwise direction corresponds to the sum of the
fixed vector z0 and a vector of length R whose angle of inclination θ varies from
θ = 0 to θ = 2π.

Simple trigonometry tells us that eiθ has the familiar additive property of the exponential function in calculus:
eiθ1 eiθ2 = (cos θ1 + i sin θ1 )(cos θ2 + i sin θ2 )
= (cos θ1 cos θ2 − sin θ1 sin θ2 ) + i(sin θ1 cos θ2 + cos θ1 sin θ2 )
= cos(θ1 + θ2 ) + i sin(θ1 + θ2 ) = ei(θ1 +θ2 ) .

Expressions (1), (2), and (3) are, of course, easily remembered by applying the usual
algebraic rules for real numbers and ex .
Another important result that can be obtained formally by applying rules for
real numbers to z = reiθ is
(4)

zn = r n einθ

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

It is easily verified for positive values of n by mathematical induction. To be specific,
we first note that it becomes z = reiθ when n = 1. Next, we assume that it is valid
when n = m, where m is any positive integer. In view of expression (1) for the
product of two nonzero complex numbers in exponential form, it is then valid for
n = m + 1:
zm+1 = zm z = r m eimθ reiθ = (r m r)ei(mθ+θ) = r m+1 ei(m+1)θ .
Expression (4) is thus verified when n is a positive integer. It also holds when
n = 0, with the convention that z0 = 1. If n = −1, −2, . . . , on the other hand, we
define zn in terms of the multiplicative inverse of z by writing
zn = (z−1 )m

where m = −n = 1, 2, . . . .

Then, since equation (4) is valid for positive integers, it follows from the exponential
form (3) of z−1 that

When written in the form

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .),

this is known as de Moivre’s formula. The following example uses a special case
of it.
EXAMPLE 2.

Formula (6) with n = 2 tells us that
(cos θ + i sin θ )2 = cos 2θ + i sin 2θ,

or
cos2 θ − sin2 θ + i2 sin θ

cos θ = cos 2θ + i sin 2θ.

By equating real parts and then imaginary parts here, we have the familiar trigonometric identities
cos 2θ = cos2 θ − sin2 θ,

sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θ.

(See also Exercises 10 and 11, Sec. 8.)

8. ARGUMENTS OF PRODUCTS AND QUOTIENTS
If z1 = r1 eiθ1 and z2 = r2 eiθ2 , the expression
(1)

z1 z2 = (r1 r2 )ei(θ1 +θ2 )

in Sec. 7 can be used to obtain an important identity involving arguments:
(2)

arg(z1 z2 ) = arg z1 + arg z2 .

This result is to be interpreted as saying that if values of two of the three (multiplevalued) arguments are specified, then there is a value of the third such that the
equation holds.
We start the verification of statement (2) by letting θ1 and θ2 denote any values
of arg z1 and arg z2 , respectively. Expression (1) then tells us that θ1 + θ2 is a
value of arg(z1 z2 ). (See Fig. 9.) If, on the other hand, values of arg(z1 z2 ) and

arg z1 are specified, those values correspond to particular choices of n and n1 in the
expressions
arg(z1 z2 ) = (θ1 + θ2 ) + 2nπ

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .)

and
arg z1 = θ1 + 2n1 π

(n1 = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

Since
(θ1 + θ2 ) + 2nπ = (θ1 + 2n1 π) + [θ2 + 2(n − n1 )π],
equation (2) is evidently satisfied when the value
arg z2 = θ2 + 2(n − n1 )π
is chosen. Verification when values of arg(z1 z2 ) and arg z2 are specified follows by
symmetry.
Statement (2) is sometimes valid when arg is replaced everywhere by Arg (see
Exercise 6). But, as the following example illustrates, that is not always the case.

9. ROOTS OF COMPLEX NUMBERS
Consider now a point z = reiθ , lying on a circle centered at the origin with radius
r (Fig. 10). As θ is increased, z moves around the circle in the counterclockwise
direction. In particular, when θ is increased by 2π, we arrive at the original point;
and the same is true when θ is decreased by 2π. It is, therefore, evident from Fig. 10
that two nonzero complex numbers

Roots of Complex Numbers

are equal if and only if
r1 = r2

and θ1 = θ2 + 2kπ,

where k is some integer (k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).
This observation, together with the expression zn = r n einθ in Sec. 7 for integral
powers of complex numbers z = reiθ , is useful in finding the nth roots of any
nonzero complex number z0 = r0 eiθ0 , where n has one of the values n = 2, 3, . . . .
The method starts with the fact that an nth root of z0 is a nonzero number z = reiθ
such that zn = z0 , or
r n einθ = r0 eiθ0 .
According to the statement in italics just above, then,
r n = r0

and nθ = θ0 + 2kπ,
√
where k is any integer (k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .). So r = n r0 , where this radical denotes
the unique positive nth root of the positive real number r0 , and

are the nth roots of z0 . We are able to see immediately from this exponential form
√
of the roots that they all lie on the circle |z| = n r0 about the origin and are equally
spaced every 2π/n radians, starting with argument θ0 /n. Evidently, then, all of the
distinct roots are obtained when k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, and no further roots arise
with other values of k. We let ck (k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1) denote these distinct roots
and write

The number n r0 is the length of each of the radius vectors representing the
n roots. The first root c0 has argument θ0 /n; and the two roots when n = 2 lie at
√
the opposite ends of a diameter of the circle |z| = n r0 , the second root being −c0 .
When n ≥ 3, the roots lie at the vertices of a regular polygon of n sides inscribed
in that circle.
1/n
We shall let z0 denote the set of nth roots of z0 . If, in particular, z0 is a
1/n
positive real number r0 , the symbol r0 denotes the entire set of roots; and the
√
symbol n r0 in expression (1) is reserved for the one positive root. When the value
of θ0 that is used in expression (1) is the principal value of arg z0 (−π < θ0 ≤ π),
the number c0 is referred to as the principal root. Thus when z0 is a positive real
√
number r0 , its principal root is n r0 .

11. REGIONS IN THE COMPLEX PLANE
In this section, we are concerned with sets of complex numbers, or points in the
z plane, and their closeness to one another. Our basic tool is the concept of an
ε neighborhood
|z − z0 | < ε

(1)

of a given point z0 . It consists of all points z lying inside but not on a circle
centered at z0 and with a specified positive radius ε (Fig. 15). When the value of ε
is understood or is immaterial in the discussion, the set (1) is often referred to as just
a neighborhood. Occasionally, it is convenient to speak of a deleted neighborhood,
or punctured disk,
0 < |z − z0 | < ε

(2)

consisting of all points z in an ε neighborhood of z0 except for the point z0 itself.

FIGURE 15

A point z0 is said to be an interior point of a set S whenever there is some
neighborhood of z0 that contains only points of S; it is called an exterior point of
S when there exists a neighborhood of it containing no points of S. If z0 is neither
of these, it is a boundary point of S. A boundary point is, therefore, a point all of
whose neighborhoods contain at least one point in S and at least one point not in S.
The totality of all boundary points is called the boundary of S. The circle |z| = 1,
for instance, is the boundary of each of the sets
(3)

|z| < 1

and |z| ≤ 1.

chap. 1

A set is open if it contains none of its boundary points. It is left as an exercise
to show that a set is open if and only if each of its points is an interior point. A set
is closed if it contains all of its boundary points, and the closure of a set S is the
closed set consisting of all points in S together with the boundary of S. Note that
the first of the sets (3) is open and that the second is its closure.
Some sets are, of course, neither open nor closed. For a set to be not open,
there must be a boundary point that is contained in the set; and if a set is not closed,
there exists a boundary point not contained in the set. Observe that the punctured
disk 0 < |z| ≤ 1 is neither open nor closed. The set of all complex numbers is, on
the other hand, both open and closed since it has no boundary points.
An open set S is connected if each pair of points z1 and z2 in it can be joined
by a polygonal line, consisting of a finite number of line segments joined end to end,
that lies entirely in S. The open set |z| < 1 is connected. The annulus 1 < |z| < 2
is, of course, open and it is also connected (see Fig. 16). A nonempty open set
that is connected is called a domain. Note that any neighborhood is a domain. A
domain together with some, none, or all of its boundary points is referred to as a
region.

A set S is bounded if every point of S lies inside some circle |z| = R; otherwise,
it is unbounded. Both of the sets (3) are bounded regions, and the half plane Re z ≥ 0
is unbounded.
A point z0 is said to be an accumulation point of a set S if each deleted
neighborhood of z0 contains at least one point of S. It follows that if a set S is
closed, then it contains each of its accumulation points. For if an accumulation
point z0 were not in S, it would be a boundary point of S; but this contradicts the
fact that a closed set contains all of its boundary points. It is left as an exercise to
show that the converse is, in fact, true. Thus a set is closed if and only if it contains
all of its accumulation points.
Evidently, a point z0 is not an accumulation point of a set S whenever there
exists some deleted neighborhood of z0 that does not contain at least one point of S.
Note that the origin is the only accumulation point of the set zn = i/n (n = 1, 2, . . .).

ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS

We now consider functions of a complex variable and develop a theory of differentiation for them. The main goal of the chapter is to introduce analytic functions,
which play a central role in complex analysis.

12. FUNCTIONS OF A COMPLEX VARIABLE
Let S be a set of complex numbers. A function f defined on S is a rule that assigns
to each z in S a complex number w. The number w is called the value of f at z and
is denoted by f (z); that is, w = f (z). The set S is called the domain of definition
of f .∗
It must be emphasized that both a domain of definition and a rule are needed
in order for a function to be well defined. When the domain of definition is not
mentioned, we agree that the largest possible set is to be taken. Also, it is not
always convenient to use notation that distinguishes between a given function and
its values.
EXAMPLE 1. If f is defined on the set z = 0 by means of the equation
w = 1/z, it may be referred to only as the function w = 1/z, or simply the function 1/z.
Suppose that w = u + iv is the value of a function f at z = x + iy, so that
u + iv = f (x + iy).
∗ Although the domain of definition is often a domain as defined in Sec. 11, it need not be.

Analytic Functions

chap. 2

Each of the real numbers u and v depends on the real variables x and y, and it
follows that f (z) can be expressed in terms of a pair of real-valued functions of
the real variables x and y:
f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y).

(1)

If the polar coordinates r and θ , instead of x and y, are used, then
u + iv = f (reiθ )
where w = u + iv and z = reiθ . In that case, we may write
f (z) = u(r, θ ) + iv(r, θ ).

(2)
EXAMPLE 2.

If f (z) = z2 , then
f (x + iy) = (x + iy)2 = x 2 − y 2 + i2xy.

Hence
u(x, y) = x 2 − y 2

and v(x, y) = 2xy.

When polar coordinates are used,
f (reiθ ) = (reiθ )2 = r 2 ei2θ = r 2 cos 2θ + ir 2 sin 2θ.
Consequently,
u(r, θ ) = r 2 cos 2θ

and v(r, θ ) = r 2 sin 2θ.

If, in either of equations (1) and (2), the function v always has value zero, then
the value of f is always real. That is, f is a real-valued function of a complex
variable.
EXAMPLE 3. A real-valued function that is used to illustrate some important
concepts later in this chapter is
f (z) = |z|2 = x 2 + y 2 + i0.

If n is zero or a positive integer and if a0 , a1 , a2 , . . . , an are complex constants,
where an = 0, the function
P (z) = a0 + a1 z + a2 z2 + · · · + an zn
is a polynomial of degree n. Note that the sum here has a finite number of terms
and that the domain of definition is the entire z plane. Quotients P (z)/Q(z) of

sec. 12

37

polynomials are called rational functions and are defined at each point z where
Q(z) = 0. Polynomials and rational functions constitute elementary, but important,
classes of functions of a complex variable.
A generalization of the concept of function is a rule that assigns more than
one value to a point z in the domain of definition. These multiple-valued functions occur in the theory of functions of a complex variable, just as they do in
the case of a real variable. When multiple-valued functions are studied, usually
just one of the possible values assigned to each point is taken, in a systematic
manner, and a (single-valued) function is constructed from the multiple-valued
function.
EXAMPLE 4. Let z denote any nonzero complex number. We know from
Sec. 9 that z1/2 has the two values

 
√

(3)
(r > 0, −π <  ≤ π),
f (z) = r exp i
2
the (single-valued) function (3) is well defined on the set of nonzero numbers in
the z plane. Since zero is the only square root of zero, we also write f (0) = 0. The
function f is then well defined on the entire plane.

13. MAPPINGS
Properties of a real-valued function of a real variable are often exhibited by the
graph of the function. But when w = f (z), where z and w are complex, no such
convenient graphical representation of the function f is available because each of
the numbers z and w is located in a plane rather than on a line. One can, however,
display some information about the function by indicating pairs of corresponding
points z = (x, y) and w = (u, v). To do this, it is generally simpler to draw the z
and w planes separately.
When a function f is thought of in this way, it is often referred to as a mapping,
or transformation. The image of a point z in the domain of definition S is the point
w = f (z), and the set of images of all points in a set T that is contained in S is
called the image of T . The image of the entire domain of definition S is called the
range of f . The inverse image of a point w is the set of all points z in the domain
of definition of f that have w as their image. The inverse image of a point may
contain just one point, many points, or none at all. The last case occurs, of course,
when w is not in the range of f .
Terms such as translation, rotation, and reflection are used to convey dominant geometric characteristics of certain mappings. In such cases, it is sometimes
convenient to consider the z and w planes to be the same. For example, the mapping
w = z + 1 = (x + 1) + iy,
where z = x + iy, can be thought of as a translation of each point z one unit to the
right. Since i = eiπ/2 , the mapping

π 
,
w = iz = r exp i θ +
2
where z = reiθ , rotates the radius vector for each nonzero point z through a right
angle about the origin in the counterclockwise direction; and the mapping
w = z = x − iy
transforms each point z = x + iy into its reflection in the real axis.
More information is usually exhibited by sketching images of curves and
regions than by simply indicating images of individual points. In the following
three examples, we illustrate this with the transformation w = z2 . We begin by
finding the images of some curves in the z plane.

sec. 13

Mappings

39

EXAMPLE 1. According to Example 2 in Sec. 12, the mapping w = z2 can
be thought of as the transformation
u = x2 − y2,

(1)

v = 2xy

from the xy plane into the uv plane. This form of the mapping is especially useful
in finding the images of certain hyperbolas.
It is easy to show, for instance, that each branch of a hyperbola
x 2 − y 2 = c1

(2)

(c1 > 0)

is mapped in a one to one manner onto the vertical line u = c1 . We start by noting
from the first of equations (1) that u = c1 when (x, y) is a point lying on either
branch. When, in particular,
 it lies on the right-hand branch, the second of equations
(1) tells us that v = 2y y 2 + c1 . Thus the image of the right-hand branch can be
expressed parametrically as

(−∞ < y < ∞);
u = c1 , v = 2y y 2 + c1
and it is evident that the image of a point (x, y) on that branch moves upward along
the entire line as (x, y) traces out the branch in the upward direction (Fig. 17).
Likewise, since the pair of equations

u = c1 , v = −2y y 2 + c1
(−∞ < y < ∞)
furnishes a parametric representation for the image of the left-hand branch of the
hyperbola, the image of a point going downward along the entire left-hand branch
is seen to move up the entire line u = c1 .

On the other hand, each branch of a hyperbola
(3)

2xy = c2

(c2 > 0)

is transformed into the line v = c2 , as indicated in Fig. 17. To verify this, we
note from the second of equations (1) that v = c2 when (x, y) is a point on either

branch. Suppose that (x, y) is on the branch lying in the first quadrant. Then, since
y = c2 /(2x), the first of equations (1) reveals that the branch’s image has parametric
representation

(0 < x < ∞).
u = x 2 − 22 , v = c2
4x
Observe that
lim u = −∞ and

x→∞

Since u depends continuously on x, then, it is clear that as (x, y) travels down the
entire upper branch of hyperbola (3), its image moves to the right along the entire
horizontal line v = c2 . Inasmuch as the image of the lower branch has parametric
representation
u=

lim u = −∞ and

it follows that the image of a point moving upward along the entire lower branch
also travels to the right along the entire line v = c2 (see Fig. 17).
We shall now use Example 1 to find the image of a certain region.
EXAMPLE 2. The domain x > 0, y > 0, xy < 1 consists of all points lying
on the upper branches of hyperbolas from the family 2xy = c, where 0 < c < 2
(Fig. 18). We know from Example 1 that as a point travels downward along the
entirety of such a branch, its image under the transformation w = z2 moves to the
right along the entire line v = c. Since, for all values of c between 0 and 2, these
upper branches fill out the domain x > 0, y > 0, xy < 1, that domain is mapped
onto the horizontal strip 0 < v < 2.

In view of equations (1), the image of a point (0, y) in the z plane is (−y 2 , 0).
Hence as (0, y) travels downward to the origin along the y axis, its image moves
to the right along the negative u axis and reaches the origin in the w plane. Then,
since the image of a point (x, 0) is (x 2 , 0), that image moves to the right from the
origin along the u axis as (x, 0) moves to the right from the origin along the x axis.
The image of the upper branch of the hyperbola xy = 1 is, of course, the horizontal
line v = 2. Evidently, then, the closed region x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, xy ≤ 1 is mapped onto
the closed strip 0 ≤ v ≤ 2, as indicated in Fig. 18.
Our last example here illustrates how polar coordinates can be useful in analyzing certain mappings.
EXAMPLE 3.

The mapping w = z2 becomes
w = r 2 ei2θ

(4)

when z = reiθ . Evidently, then, the image w = ρeiφ of any nonzero point z is found
by squaring the modulus r = |z| and doubling the value θ of arg z that is used:
ρ = r2

(5)

and φ = 2θ.

Observe that points z = r0 eiθ on a circle r = r0 are transformed into points
w = r02 ei2θ on the circle ρ = r02 . As a point on the first circle moves counterclockwise from the positive real axis to the positive imaginary axis, its image on the
second circle moves counterclockwise from the positive real axis to the negative
real axis (see Fig. 19). So, as all possible positive values of r0 are chosen, the
corresponding arcs in the z and w planes fill out the first quadrant and the upper
half plane, respectively. The transformation w = z2 is, then, a one to one mapping of the first quadrant r ≥ 0, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 in the z plane onto the upper half
ρ ≥ 0, 0 ≤ φ ≤ π of the w plane, as indicated in Fig. 19. The point z = 0 is, of
course, mapped onto the point w = 0.

The transformation w = z2 also maps the upper half plane r ≥ 0, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π
onto the entire w plane. However, in this case, the transformation is not one to one
since both the positive and negative real axes in the z plane are mapped onto the
positive real axis in the w plane.

42

chap. 2

When n is a positive integer greater than 2, various mapping properties of
the transformation w = zn , or w = r n einθ , are similar to those of w = z2 . Such a
transformation maps the entire z plane onto the entire w plane, where each nonzero
point in the w plane is the image of n distinct points in the z plane. The circle
r = r0 is mapped onto the circle ρ = r0n ; and the sector r ≤ r0 , 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π/n is
mapped onto the disk ρ ≤ r0n , but not in a one to one manner.
Other, but somewhat more involved, mappings by w = z2 appear in Example
1, Sec. 97, and Exercises 1 through 4 of that section.

14. MAPPINGS BY THE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION
In Chap. 3 we shall introduce and develop properties of a number of elementary functions which do not involve polynomials. That chapter will start with the
exponential function
ez = ex eiy

(1)

(z = x + iy),

the two factors ex and eiy being well defined at this time (see Sec. 6). Note that
definition (1), which can also be written
ex+iy = ex eiy ,
is suggested by the familiar additive property
ex1 +x2 = ex1 ex2
of the exponential function in calculus.
The object of this section is to use the function ez to provide the reader with
additional examples of mappings that continue to be reasonably simple. We begin
by examining the images of vertical and horizontal lines.
EXAMPLE 1.
(2)

The transformation
w = ez

can be written w = ex eiy , where z = x + iy, according to equation (1). Thus, if
w = ρeiφ , transformation (2) can be expressed in the form
(3)

ρ = ex ,

φ = y.

The image of a typical point z = (c1 , y) on a vertical line x = c1 has polar
coordinates ρ = exp c1 and φ = y in the w plane. That image moves counterclockwise around the circle shown in Fig. 20 as z moves up the line. The image of the
line is evidently the entire circle; and each point on the circle is the image of an
infinite number of points, spaced 2π units apart, along the line.

A horizontal line y = c2 is mapped in a one to one manner onto the ray
φ = c2 . To see that this is so, we note that the image of a point z = (x, c2 ) has
polar coordinates ρ = ex and φ = c2 . Consequently, as that point z moves along the
entire line from left to right, its image moves outward along the entire ray φ = c2 ,
as indicated in Fig. 20.
Vertical and horizontal line segments are mapped onto portions of circles and
rays, respectively, and images of various regions are readily obtained from observations made in Example 1. This is illustrated in the following example.
EXAMPLE 2. Let us show that the transformation w = ez maps the rectangular region a ≤ x ≤ b, c ≤ y ≤ d onto the region ea ≤ ρ ≤ eb , c ≤ φ ≤ d. The
two regions and corresponding parts of their boundaries are indicated in Fig. 21.
The vertical line segment AD is mapped onto the arc ρ = ea , c ≤ φ ≤ d, which is
labeled A D  . The images of vertical line segments to the right of AD and joining the horizontal parts of the boundary are larger arcs; eventually, the image of
the line segment BC is the arc ρ = eb , c ≤ φ ≤ d, labeled B  C  . The mapping is
one to one if d − c < 2π. In particular, if c = 0 and d = π, then 0 ≤ φ ≤ π; and
the rectangular region is mapped onto half of a circular ring, as shown in Fig. 8,
Appendix 2.

Our final example here uses the images of horizontal lines to find the image
of a horizontal strip.
EXAMPLE 3. When w = ez , the image of the infinite strip 0 ≤ y ≤ π is the
upper half v ≥ 0 of the w plane (Fig. 22). This is seen by recalling from Example 1
how a horizontal line y = c is transformed into a ray φ = c from the origin. As the
real number c increases from c = 0 to c = π, the y intercepts of the lines increase
from 0 to π and the angles of inclination of the rays increase from φ = 0 to φ = π.
This mapping is also shown in Fig. 6 of Appendix 2, where corresponding points
on the boundaries of the two regions are indicated.

8. One interpretation of a function w = f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is that of a vector field
in the domain of definition of f . The function assigns a vector w, with components
u(x, y) and v(x, y), to each point z at which it is defined. Indicate graphically the
vector fields represented by (a) w = iz; (b) w = z/|z|.

15. LIMITS
Let a function f be defined at all points z in some deleted neighborhood (Sec. l1)
of z0 . The statement that the limit of f (z) as z approaches z0 is a number w0 , or
that
lim f (z) = w0 ,

(1)

z→z0

means that the point w = f (z) can be made arbitrarily close to w0 if we choose
the point z close enough to z0 but distinct from it. We now express the definition
of limit in a precise and usable form.
Statement (1) means that for each positive number ε, there is a positive number
δ such that
|f (z) − w0 | < ε

(2)

whenever 0 < |z − z0 | < δ.

Geometrically, this definition says that for each ε neighborhood |w − w0 | < ε of
w0 , there is a deleted δ neighborhood 0 < |z − z0 | < δ of z0 such that every point
z in it has an image w lying in the ε neighborhood (Fig. 23). Note that even though
all points in the deleted neighborhood 0 < |z − z0 | < δ are to be considered, their
images need not fill up the entire neighborhood |w − w0 | < ε. If f has the constant
value w0 , for instance, the image of z is always the center of that neighborhood.
Note, too, that once a δ has been found, it can be replaced by any smaller positive
number, such as δ/2.

It is easy to show that when a limit of a function f (z) exists at a point z0 , it is
unique. To do this, we suppose that
lim f (z) = w0

z→z0

and

lim f (z) = w1 .

z→z0

Then, for each positive number ε, there are positive numbers δ0 and δ1 such that
|f (z) − w0 | < ε

whenever 0 < |z − z0 | < δ0

46

Analytic Functions

chap. 2

and
|f (z) − w1 | < ε

whenever 0 < |z − z0 | < δ1 .

So if 0 < |z − z0 | < δ, where δ is any positive number that is smaller than δ0 and
δ1 , we find that
|w1 − w0 | = |[f (z) − w0 ] − [f (z) − w1 ]| ≤ |f (z) − w0 | + |f (z) − w1 | < ε + ε = 2ε.
But |w1 − w0 | is a nonnegative constant, and ε can be chosen arbitrarily small.
Hence
w1 − w0 = 0, or w1 = w0 .
Definition (2) requires that f be defined at all points in some deleted neighborhood of z0 . Such a deleted neighborhood, of course, always exists when z0 is
an interior point of a region on which f is defined. We can extend the definition of
limit to the case in which z0 is a boundary point of the region by agreeing that the
first of inequalities (2) need be satisfied by only those points z that lie in both the
region and the deleted neighborhood.

If limit (1) exists, the symbol z → z0 implies that z is allowed to approach z0
in an arbitrary manner, not just from some particular direction. The next example
emphasizes this.

approach the origin in any manner. But when z = (x, 0) is a nonzero point on the
real axis (Fig. 25),

f (z) =

and when z = (0, y) is a nonzero point on the imaginary axis,
f (z) =

0 − iy

Thus, by letting z approach the origin along the real axis, we would find that the
desired limit is 1. An approach along the imaginary axis would, on the other hand,
yield the limit −1. Since a limit is unique, we must conclude that limit (5) does not
exist.

16. THEOREMS ON LIMITS
We can expedite our treatment of limits by establishing a connection between limits
of functions of a complex variable and limits of real-valued functions of two real
variables. Since limits of the latter type are studied in calculus, we use their definition
and properties freely.
Theorem 1.

Suppose that
f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) (z = x + iy)

and
z0 = x0 + iy0 ,

w0 = u0 + iv0 .

Then
lim f (z) = w0

(1)

z→z0

if and only if
(2)

lim

(x,y)→(x0 ,y0 )

u(x, y) = u0 and

lim

(x,y)→(x0 ,y0 )

v(x, y) = v0 .

To prove the theorem, we first assume that limits (2) hold and obtain limit (1).
Limits (2) tell us that for each positive number ε, there exist positive numbers δ1
and δ2 such that

ε
|u − u0 | <
(3)
whenever 0 < (x − x0 )2 + (y − y0 )2 < δ1
2
and

ε
|v − v0 | <
whenever 0 < (x − x0 )2 + (y − y0 )2 < δ2 .
(4)
2
Let δ be any positive number smaller than δ1 and δ2 . Since
|(u + iv) − (u0 + iv0 )| = |(u − u0 ) + i(v − v0 )| ≤ |u − u0 | + |v − v0 |
and

(x − x0 )2 + (y − y0 )2 = |(x − x0 ) + i(y − y0 )| = |(x + iy) − (x0 + iy0 )|,
it follows from statements (3) and (4) that
|(u + iv) − (u0 + iv0 )| <

ε
ε
+ =ε
2 2

whenever
0 < |(x + iy) − (x0 + iy0 )| < δ.
That is, limit (1) holds.

sec. 16

Theorems on Limits

49

Let us now start with the assumption that limit (1) holds. With that assumption, we know that for each positive number ε, there is a positive number δ such
that
|(u + iv) − (u0 + iv0 )| < ε

(5)
whenever

0 < |(x + iy) − (x0 + iy0 )| < δ.

(6)
But

|u − u0 | ≤ |(u − u0 ) + i(v − v0 )| = |(u + iv) − (u0 + iv0 )|,
|v − v0 | ≤ |(u − u0 ) + i(v − v0 )| = |(u + iv) − (u0 + iv0 )|,
and
|(x + iy) − (x0 + iy0 )| = |(x − x0 ) + i(y − y0 )| =


(x − x0 )2 + (y − y0 )2 .

Hence it follows from inequalities (5) and (6) that
|u − u0 | < ε
whenever
0<



and |v − v0 | < ε

(x − x0 )2 + (y − y0 )2 < δ.

This establishes limits (2), and the proof of the theorem is complete.
Theorem 2.
(7)

Suppose that
lim f (z) = w0 and

z→z0

lim F (z) = W0 .

z→z0

Then
(8)
(9)

lim [f (z) + F (z)] = w0 + W0 ,

z→z0

lim [f (z)F (z)] = w0 W0 ;

z→z0

and, if W0 = 0 ,
(10)

lim

f (z)

z→z0 F (z)

=

w0
.
W0

This important theorem can be proved directly by using the definition of the
limit of a function of a complex variable. But, with the aid of Theorem 1, it follows
almost immediately from theorems on limits of real-valued functions of two real
variables.

50

Analytic Functions

chap. 2

To verify property (9), for example, we write
f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y),
z0 = x0 + iy0 ,

F (z) = U (x, y) + iV (x, y),

w0 = u0 + iv0 ,

W0 = U0 + iV0 .

Then, according to hypotheses (7) and Theorem 1, the limits as (x, y) approaches
(x0 , y0 ) of the functions u, v, U , and V exist and have the values u0 , v0 , U0 , and
V0 , respectively. So the real and imaginary components of the product
f (z)F (z) = (uU − vV ) + i(vU + uV )
have the limits u0 U0 − v0 V0 and v0 U0 + u0 V0 , respectively, as (x, y) approaches
(x0 , y0 ). Hence, by Theorem 1 again, f (z)F (z) has the limit
(u0 U0 − v0 V0 ) + i(v0 U0 + u0 V0 )
as z approaches z0 ; and this is equal to w0 W0 . Property (9) is thus established.
Corresponding verifications of properties (8) and (10) can be given.
It is easy to see from definition (2), Sec. 15, of limit that
lim c = c

z→z0

and

lim z = z0 ,

z→z0

where z0 and c are any complex numbers; and, by property (9) and mathematical
induction, it follows that
lim zn = z0n

z→z0

(n = 1, 2, . . .).

So, in view of properties (8) and (9), the limit of a polynomial
P (z) = a0 + a1 z + a2 z2 + · · · + an zn
as z approaches a point z0 is the value of the polynomial at that point:
(11)

lim P (z) = P (z0 ).

z→z0

17. LIMITS INVOLVING THE POINT AT INFINITY
It is sometimes convenient to include with the complex plane the point at infinity,
denoted by ∞, and to use limits involving it. The complex plane together with this
point is called the extended complex plane. To visualize the point at infinity, one can
think of the complex plane as passing through the equator of a unit sphere centered
at the origin (Fig. 26). To each point z in the plane there corresponds exactly one
point P on the surface of the sphere. The point P is the point where the line through
z and the north pole N intersects the sphere. In like manner, to each point P on the
surface of the sphere, other than the north pole N , there corresponds exactly one

sec. 17

FIGURE 26

point z in the plane. By letting the point N of the sphere correspond to the point
at infinity, we obtain a one to one correspondence between the points of the sphere
and the points of the extended complex plane. The sphere is known as the Riemann
sphere, and the correspondence is called a stereographic projection.
Observe that the exterior of the unit circle centered at the origin in the complex
plane corresponds to the upper hemisphere with the equator and the point N deleted.
Moreover, for each small positive number ε, those points in the complex plane
exterior to the circle |z| = 1/ε correspond to points on the sphere close to N . We
thus call the set |z| > 1/ε an ε neighborhood, or neighborhood, of ∞.
Let us agree that in referring to a point z, we mean a point in the finite plane.
Hereafter, when the point at infinity is to be considered, it will be specifically
mentioned.
A meaning is now readily given to the statement
lim f (z) = w0

z→z0

when either z0 or w0 , or possibly each of these numbers, is replaced by the point
at infinity. In the definition of limit in Sec. 15, we simply replace the appropriate
neighborhoods of z0 and w0 by neighborhoods of ∞. The proof of the following
theorem illustrates how this is done.
Theorem. If z0 and w0 are points in the z and w planes, respectively, then
(1)

lim f (z) = ∞ if and only if

We start the proof by noting that the first of limits (1) means that for each
positive number ε, there is a positive number δ such that
|f (z)| >

(4)

whenever 0 < |z − z0 | < δ.

That is, the point w = f (z) lies in the ε neighborhood |w| > 1/ε of ∞ whenever
z lies in the deleted neighborhood 0 < |z − z0 | < δ of z0 . Since statement (4) can

number ε, there is a positive number δ such that
|f (z)| >

Continuity

18. CONTINUITY
A function f is continuous at a point z0 if all three of the following conditions are
satisfied:
lim f (z) exists,

(1)

z→z0

(2)

f (z0 ) exists,
lim f (z) = f (z0 ).

(3)

z→z0

Observe that statement (3) actually contains statements (1) and (2), since the existence of the quantity on each side of the equation there is needed. Statement (3)
says, of course, that for each positive number ε, there is a positive number δ such
that
|f (z) − f (z0 )| < ε

(4)

whenever |z − z0 | < δ.

A function of a complex variable is said to be continuous in a region R if it is
continuous at each point in R.
If two functions are continuous at a point, their sum and product are also continuous at that point; their quotient is continuous at any such point if the denominator
is not zero there. These observations are direct consequences of Theorem 2, Sec.
16. Note, too, that a polynomial is continuous in the entire plane because of limit
(11) in Sec. 16.
We turn now to two expected properties of continuous functions whose verifications are not so immediate. Our proofs depend on definition (4) of continuity,
and we present the results as theorems.
Theorem 1.

A composition of continuous functions is itself continuous.

A precise statement of this theorem is contained in the proof to follow. We let
w = f (z) be a function that is defined for all z in a neighborhood |z − z0 | < δ of a
point z0 , and we let W = g(w) be a function whose domain of definition contains
the image (Sec. 13) of that neighborhood under f . The composition W = g[f (z)]
is, then, defined for all z in the neighborhood |z − z0 | < δ. Suppose now that f
is continuous at z0 and that g is continuous at the point f (z0 ) in the w plane. In
view of the continuity of g at f (z0 ), there is, for each positive number ε, a positive
number γ such that
|g[f (z)] − g[f (z0 )]| < ε

whenever |f (z) − f (z0 )| < γ .

(See Fig. 27.) But the continuity of f at z0 ensures that the neighborhood |z − z0 | < δ
can be made small enough that the second of these inequalities holds. The continuity
of the composition g[f (z)] is, therefore, established.

Theorem 2. If a function f (z) is continuous and nonzero at a point z0 , then
f (z) = 0 throughout some neighborhood of that point.
Assuming that f (z) is, in fact, continuous and nonzero at z0 , we can prove
Theorem 2 by assigning the positive value |f (z0 )|/2 to the number ε in statement
(4). This tells us that there is a positive number δ such that
|f (z0 )|
whenever |z − z0 | < δ.
2
So if there is a point z in the neighborhood |z − z0 | < δ at which f (z) = 0, we
have the contradiction
|f (z) − f (z0 )| <

|f (z0 )| <

|f (z0 )|
;
2

and the theorem is proved.
The continuity of a function
(5)

f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)

is closely related to the continuity of its component functions u(x, y) and v(x, y).
We note, for instance, how it follows from Theorem 1 in Sec. 16 that the function
(5) is continuous at a point z0 = (x0 , y0 ) if and only if its component functions are
continuous there. Our proof of the next theorem illustrates the use of this statement. The theorem is extremely important and will be used often in later chapters,
especially in applications. Before stating the theorem, we recall from Sec. 11 that a
region R is closed if it contains all of its boundary points and that it is bounded if
it lies inside some circle centered at the origin.
Theorem 3. If a function f is continuous throughout a region R that is both
closed and bounded, there exists a nonnegative real number M such that
(6)

|f (z)| ≤ M

for all points z inR,

where equality holds for at least one such z.

sec. 18

To prove this, we assume that the function f in equation (5) is continuous and
note how it follows that the function

[u(x, y)]2 + [v(x, y)]2
is continuous throughout R and thus reaches a maximum value M somewhere in
R.∗ Inequality (6) thus holds, and we say that f is bounded on R.

If the limit of
w/ z exists, it can be found by letting the point
z = ( x, y) approach the origin (0, 0) in the z plane in any manner. In particular, as z approaches (0, 0) horizontally through the points ( x, 0) on the real
axis (Fig. 29),
z=

x + i0 =

x − i0 =

x + i0 =

z.

In that case, expression (4) tells us that
w

Hence if the limit of w/ z exists, its value must be unity. However, when z
approaches (0, 0) vertically through the points (0, y) on the imaginary axis, so that
z = 0 + i y = 0 − i y = −(0 + i y) = − z,
we find from expression (4) that
w
− z
=
= −1.

Hence the limit must be −1 if it exists. Since limits are unique (Sec. 15), it follows
that dw/dz does not exist anywhere.

and

Hence if the limit of w/ z exists as
used in Example 2, tells us that

z tends to zero, the uniqueness of limits,

z + z = z − z,
or z = 0. Evidently, then dw/dz cannot exist when z = 0.
To show that dw/dz does, in fact, exist at z = 0, we need only observe that
expression (5) reduces to
w
=
z

z

when z = 0. We conclude, therefore, that dw/dz exists only at z = 0, its value
there being 0.
Example 3 shows that a function f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) can be differentiable at a point z = (x, y) but nowhere else in any neighborhood of that point.
Since
u(x, y) = x 2 + y 2

(6)

and v(x, y) = 0

when f (z) = |z|2 , it also shows that the real and imaginary components of a function
of a complex variable can have continuous partial derivatives of all orders at a point
z = (x, y) and yet the function may not be differentiable there.
The function f (z) = |z|2 is continuous at each point in the plane since its
components (6) are continuous at each point. So the continuity of a function at a
point does not imply the existence of a derivative there. It is, however, true that
the existence of the derivative of a function at a point implies the continuity of the
function at that point. To see this, we assume that f  (z0 ) exists and write
lim [f (z) − f (z0 )] = lim

z→z0

z→z0

f (z) − f (z0 )
lim (z − z0 ) = f  (z0 ) · 0 = 0,
z→z0
z − z0

from which it follows that
lim f (z) = f (z0 ).

z→z0

This is the statement of continuity of f at z0 (Sec. 18).
Geometric interpretations of derivatives of functions of a complex variable are
not as immediate as they are for derivatives of functions of a real variable. We defer
the development of such interpretations until Chap. 9.

20. DIFFERENTIATION FORMULAS
The definition of derivative in Sec. 19 is identical in form to that of the derivative
of a real-valued function of a real variable. In fact, the basic differentiation formulas
given below can be derived from the definition in Sec. 19 by essentially the same
steps as the ones used in calculus. In these formulas, the derivative of a function f
at a point z is denoted by either
d
f (z)
dz

or

f  (z),

Let us derive formula (4). To do this, we write the following expression for

and, letting z tend to zero, we arrive at the desired formula for the derivative
of f (z)g(z). Here we have used the fact that g is continuous at the point z, since

sec. 20

g  (z) exists; thus g(z + z) tends to g(z) as z tends to zero (see Exercise 8,
Sec. 18).
There is also a chain rule for differentiating composite functions. Suppose that
f has a derivative at z0 and that g has a derivative at the point f (z0 ). Then the
function F (z) = g[f (z)] has a derivative at z0 , and
F  (z0 ) = g  [f (z0 )]f  (z0 ).

W = w5 . Then

To start the derivation of formula (6), choose a specific point z0 at which f  (z0 )
exists. Write w0 = f (z0 ) and also assume that g  (w0 ) exists. There is, then, some ε
neighborhood |w − w0 | < ε of w0 such that for all points w in that neighborhood,
we can define a function having the values (w0 ) = 0 and
(7)

(w) =

g(w) − g(w0 )
− g  (w0 )
w − w0

when w = w0 .

Note that in view of the definition of derivative,
(8)

lim

w→w0

(w) = 0.

Hence is continuous at w0 .
Now expression (7) can be put in the form
(9)

g(w) − g(w0 ) = [g  (w0 ) +

(w)](w − w0 )

(|w − w0 | < ε),

which is valid even when w = w0 ; and since f  (z0 ) exists and f is therefore
continuous at z0 , we can choose a positive number δ such that the point f (z)
lies in the ε neighborhood |w − w0 | < ε of w0 if z lies in the δ neighborhood
|z − z0 | < δ of z0 . Thus it is legitimate to replace the variable w in equation (9) by
f (z) when z is any point in the neighborhood |z − z0 | < δ. With that substitution,
and with w0 = f (z0 ), equation (9) becomes
(10)

g[f (z)] − g[f (z0 )]
= {g  [f (z0 )] +
z − z0

where we must stipulate that z = z0 so that we are not dividing by zero. As already
noted, f is continuous at z0 and
is continuous at the point w0 = f (z0 ). Hence
the composition [f (z)] is continuous at z0 ; and since (w0 ) = 0,
[f (z)] = 0.

So equation (10) becomes equation (6) in the limit as z approaches z0 .

f  (0) does not exist. Note that to obtain this result, it is not sufficient to consider
only horizontal and vertical approaches to the origin in the z plane. (Compare with
Example 2, Sec. 19.)

21. CAUCHY–RIEMANN EQUATIONS
In this section, we obtain a pair of equations that the first-order partial derivatives
of the component functions u and v of a function
f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)

(1)

must satisfy at a point z0 = (x0 , y0 ) when the derivative of f exists there. We also
show how to express f  (z0 ) in terms of those partial derivatives.
We start by writing
z0 = x0 + iy0 ,

z=

x + i y,

and
w = f (z0 +
= [u(x0 +

z) − f (z0 )
x, y0 + y) − u(x0 , y0 )] + i[v(x0 +

x, y0 + y) − v(x0 , y0 )].

Now it is important to keep in mind that expression (3) is valid as ( x, y)
tends to (0, 0) in any manner that we may choose. In particular, we let ( x, y) tend
to (0, 0) horizontally through the points ( x, 0), as indicated in Fig. 29 (Sec. 19).

f  (z0 ) = ux (x0 , y0 ) + ivx (x0 , y0 ).

Hence it follows from expression (3) that

where the partial derivatives of u and v are, this time, with respect to y. Note that
equation (5) can also be written in the form
f  (z0 ) = −i[uy (x0 , y0 ) + ivy (x0 , y0 )].

sec. 21

Cauchy–Riemann Equations

65

Equations (4) and (5) not only give f  (z0 ) in terms of partial derivatives of the
component functions u and v, but they also provide necessary conditions for the
existence of f  (z0 ). To obtain those conditions, we need only equate the real parts
and then the imaginary parts on the right-hand sides of equations (4) and (5) to see
that the existence of f  (z0 ) requires that
ux (x0 , y0 ) = vy (x0 , y0 )

(6)

and uy (x0 , y0 ) = −vx (x0 , y0 ).

Equations (6) are the Cauchy–Riemann equations, so named in honor of the French
mathematician A. L. Cauchy (1789–1857), who discovered and used them, and
in honor of the German mathematician G. F. B. Riemann (1826–1866), who made
them fundamental in his development of the theory of functions of a complex
variable.
We summarize the above results as follows.
Theorem. Suppose that
f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)
and that f  (z) exists at a point z0 = x0 + iy0 . Then the first-order partial derivatives
of u and v must exist at (x0 , y0 ), and they must satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations
ux = vy ,

(7)

uy = −vx

there. Also, f  (z0 ) can be written
f  (z0 ) = ux + ivx ,

(8)

where these partial derivatives are to be evaluated at (x0 , y0 ).
EXAMPLE 1.

In Example 1, Sec. 19, we showed that the function
f (z) = z2 = x 2 − y 2 + i2xy

is differentiable everywhere and that f  (z) = 2z. To verify that the Cauchy–Riemann
equations are satisfied everywhere, write
u(x, y) = x 2 − y 2

and v(x, y) = 2xy.

ux = 2x = vy ,

uy = −2y = −vx .

Thus
Moreover, according to equation (8),
f  (z) = 2x + i2y = 2(x + iy) = 2z.

66

chap. 2

Since the Cauchy–Riemann equations are necessary conditions for the existence
of the derivative of a function f at a point z0 , they can often be used to locate points
at which f does not have a derivative.
EXAMPLE 2.

When f (z) = |z|2 , we have
u(x, y) = x 2 + y 2

and v(x, y) = 0.

If the Cauchy–Riemann equations are to hold at a point (x, y), it follows that 2x = 0
and 2y = 0, or that x = y = 0. Consequently, f  (z) does not exist at any nonzero
point, as we already know from Example 3 in Sec. 19. Note that the theorem just
proved does not ensure the existence of f  (0). The theorem in the next section will,
however, do this.

22. SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR DIFFERENTIABILITY
Satisfaction of the Cauchy–Riemann equations at a point z0 = (x0 , y0 ) is not sufficient to ensure the existence of the derivative of a function f (z) at that point. (See
Exercise 6, Sec. 23.) But, with certain continuity conditions, we have the following
useful theorem.
Theorem. Let the function
f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)
be defined throughout some ε neighborhood of a point z0 = x0 + iy0 , and suppose
that
(a) the first-order partial derivatives of the functions u and v with respect to x and
y exist everywhere in the neighborhood;
(b) those partial derivatives are continuous at (x0 , y0 ) and satisfy the Cauchy–
Riemann equations
ux = vy ,

uy = −vx

at (x0 , y0 ).
Then f  (z0 ) exists, its value being
f  (z0 ) = ux + ivx
where the right-hand side is to be evaluated at (x0 , y0 ).
To prove the theorem, we assume that conditions (a) and (b) in its hypothesis
are satisfied and write z = x + i y, where 0 < | z| < ε, as well as
w = f (z0 +

z) − f (z0 ).

sec. 22

Sufficient Conditions for Differentiability

67

Thus
w=

(1)

u + i v,

where
u = u(x0 +

x, y0 + y) − u(x0 , y0 )

v = v(x0 +

x, y0 + y) − v(x0 , y0 ).

and
The assumption that the first-order partial derivatives of u and v are continuous at
the point (x0 , y0 ) enables us to write∗
u = ux (x0 , y0 ) x + uy (x0 , y0 ) y + ε1 x + ε2 y

(2)
and

v = vx (x0 , y0 ) x + vy (x0 , y0 ) y + ε3 x + ε4 y,

(3)

where ε1 , ε2 , ε3 , and ε4 tend to zero as ( x, y) approaches (0, 0) in the z plane.
Substitution of expressions (2) and (3) into equation (1) now tells us that
(4)

w = ux (x0 , y0 ) x + uy (x0 , y0 ) y + ε1 x + ε2 y
+ i[vx (x0 , y0 ) x + vy (x0 , y0 ) y + ε3 x + ε4 y].

Because the Cauchy–Riemann equations are assumed to be satisfied at (x0 , y0 ),
one can replace uy (x0 , y0 ) by −vx (x0 , y0 ) and vy (x0 , y0 ) by ux (x0 , y0 ) in equation
(4) and then divide through by the quantity z = x + i y to get
(5)

and this means that the last two terms on the right in equation (5) tend to zero
as the variable z = x + i y approaches zero. The expression for f  (z0 ) in the
statement of the theorem is now established.
EXAMPLE 1.

Consider the exponential function
f (z) = ez = ex eiy

(z = x + iy),

some of whose mapping properties were discussed in Sec. 14. In view of Euler’s
formula (Sec. 6), this function can, of course, be written
f (z) = ex cos y + iex sin y,
where y is to be taken in radians when cos y and sin y are evaluated. Then
u(x, y) = ex cos y

and v(x, y) = ex sin y.

Since ux = vy and uy = −vx everywhere and since these derivatives are everywhere
continuous, the conditions in the above theorem are satisfied at all points in the
complex plane. Thus f  (z) exists everywhere, and
f  (z) = ux + ivx = ex cos y + iex sin y.
Note that f  (z) = f (z) for all z.
EXAMPLE 2. It also follows from our theorem that the function f (z) = |z|2 ,
whose components are
u(x, y) = x 2 + y 2

and v(x, y) = 0,

has a derivative at z = 0. In fact, f  (0) = 0 + i0 = 0. We saw in Example 2,
Sec. 21, that this function cannot have a derivative at any nonzero point since
the Cauchy–Riemann equations are not satisfied at such points. (See also Example
3, Sec. 19.)

23. POLAR COORDINATES
Assuming that z0 = 0, we shall in this section use the coordinate transformation
(1)

x = r cos θ,

y = r sin θ

to restate the theorem in Sec. 22 in polar coordinates.
Depending on whether we write
z = x + iy

or

z = reiθ

(z = 0)

sec. 23

Polar Coordinates

69

when w = f (z), the real and imaginary components of w = u + iv are expressed
in terms of either the variables x and y or r and θ . Suppose that the first-order
partial derivatives of u and v with respect to x and y exist everywhere in some
neighborhood of a given nonzero point z0 and are continuous at z0 . The first-order
partial derivatives of u and v with respect to r and θ also have those properties,
and the chain rule for differentiating real-valued functions of two real variables can
be used to write them in terms of the ones with respect to x and y. More precisely,
since

one can write
(2)

ur = ux cos θ + uy sin θ,

uθ = −ux r sin θ + uy r cos θ.

vr = vx cos θ + vy sin θ,

vθ = −vx r sin θ + vy r cos θ.

Likewise,
(3)

If the partial derivatives of u and v with respect to x and y also satisfy the
Cauchy–Riemann equations
ux = vy ,

(4)

uy = −vx

at z0 , equations (3) become
(5)

vr = −uy cos θ + ux sin θ,

vθ = uy r sin θ + ux r cos θ

at that point. It is then clear from equations (2) and (5) that
(6)

rur = vθ ,

uθ = −rvr

at z0 .
If, on the other hand, equations (6) are known to hold at z0 , it is straightforward
to show (Exercise 7) that equations (4) must hold there. Equations (6) are, therefore,
an alternative form of the Cauchy–Riemann equations (4).
In view of equations (6) and the expression for f  (z0 ) that is found in Exercise 8,
we are now able to restate the theorem in Sec. 22 using r and θ.
Theorem. Let the function
f (z) = u(r, θ ) + iv(r, θ )
be defined throughout some ε neighborhood of a nonzero point z0 = r0 exp(iθ0 ),
and suppose that
(a) the first-order partial derivatives of the functions u and v with respect to r and
θ exist everywhere in the neighborhood;

70

(b) those partial derivatives are continuous at (r0 , θ0 ) and satisfy the polar form
rur = vθ ,

uθ = −rvr

of the Cauchy–Riemann equations at (r0 , θ0 ).
Then f  (z0 ) exists, its value being
f  (z0 ) = e−iθ (ur + ivr ),
where the right-hand side is to be evaluated at (r0 , θ0 ).

24. ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS
We are now ready to introduce the concept of an analytic function. A function f of
the complex variable z is analytic at a point z0 if it has a derivative at each point
in some neighborhood of z0 .∗ It follows that if f is analytic at a point z0 , it must
be analytic at each point in some neighborhood of z0 . A function f is analytic in
an open set if it has a derivative everywhere in that set. If we should speak of a
function f that is analytic in a set S which is not open, it is to be understood that
f is analytic in an open set containing S.
Note that the function f (z) = 1/z is analytic at each nonzero point in the finite
plane. But the function f (z) = |z|2 is not analytic at any point since its derivative
exists only at z = 0 and not throughout any neighborhood. (See Example 3, Sec. 19.)
An entire function is a function that is analytic at each point in the entire finite
plane. Since the derivative of a polynomial exists everywhere, it follows that every
polynomial is an entire function.
If a function f fails to be analytic at a point z0 but is analytic at some point
in every neighborhood of z0 , then z0 is called a singular point, or singularity, of
f . The point z = 0 is evidently a singular point of the function f (z) = 1/z. The
function f (z) = |z|2 , on the other hand, has no singular points since it is nowhere
analytic.
A necessary, but by no means sufficient, condition for a function f to be
analytic in a domain D is clearly the continuity of f throughout D. Satisfaction
of the Cauchy–Riemann equations is also necessary, but not sufficient. Sufficient
conditions for analyticity in D are provided by the theorems in Secs. 22 and 23.
Other useful sufficient conditions are obtained from the differentiation formulas
in Sec. 20. The derivatives of the sum and product of two functions exist wherever
∗ The terms regular and holomorphic are also used in the literature to denote analyticity.

the functions themselves have derivatives. Thus, if two functions are analytic in
a domain D, their sum and their product are both analytic in D. Similarly, their
quotient is analytic in D provided the function in the denominator does not vanish at
any point in D. In particular, the quotient P (z)/Q(z) of two polynomials is analytic
in any domain throughout which Q(z) = 0.
From the chain rule for the derivative of a composite function, we find that
a composition of two analytic functions is analytic. More precisely, suppose that a
function f (z) is analytic in a domain D and that the image (Sec. 13) of D under
the transformation w = f (z) is contained in the domain of definition of a function
g(w). Then the composition g[f (z)] is analytic in D, with derivative

g[f (z)] = g  [f (z)]f  (z).

The following property of analytic functions is especially useful, in addition to
being expected.
Theorem.
throughout D.

If f  (z) = 0 everywhere in a domain D, then f (z) must be constant

We start the proof by writing f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y). Assuming that
f  (z) = 0 in D, we note that ux + ivx = 0 ; and, in view of the Cauchy–Riemann
equations, vy − iuy = 0. Consequently,
ux = uy = 0

and vx = vy = 0

at each point in D.
Next, we show that u(x, y) is constant along any line segment L extending
from a point P to a point P  and lying entirely in D. We let s denote the distance
along L from the point P and let U denote the unit vector along L in the direction
of increasing s (see Fig. 30). We know from calculus that the directional derivative
du/ds can be written as the dot product
du

where grad u is the gradient vector
grad u = ux i + uy j.

(2)

Because ux and uy are zero everywhere in D, grad u is evidently the zero vector
at all points on L. Hence it follows from equation (1) that the derivative du/ds is
zero along L; and this means that u is constant on L.
Finally, since there is always a finite number of such line segments, joined end
to end, connecting any two points P and Q in D (Sec. 11), the values of u at P and
Q must be the same. We may conclude, then, that there is a real constant a such that
u(x, y) = a throughout D. Similarly, v(x, y) = b ; and we find that f (z) = a + bi
at each point in D.

25. EXAMPLES
As pointed out in Sec. 24, it is often possible to determine where a given function
is analytic by simply recalling various differentiation formulas in Sec. 20.
EXAMPLE 1.

The quotient
f (z) =

z3 + 4
(z2 − 3)(z2 + 1)

is evidently
analytic throughout the z plane except for the singular points
√
z = ± 3 and z = ± i. The analyticity is due to the existence of familiar differentiation formulas, which need to be applied only if the expression for f  (z) is
wanted.
When a function is given in terms of its component functions u(x, y) and
v(x, y), its analyticity can be demonstrated by direct application of the Cauchy–
Riemann equations.
EXAMPLE 2.

If
f (z) = cosh x cos y + i sinh x sin y,

the component functions are
u(x, y) = cosh x cos y

and v(x, y) = sinh x sin y.

Because
ux = sinh x cos y = vy

and uy = − cosh x sin y = −vx

everywhere, it is clear from the theorem in Sec. 22 that f is entire.

76

Analytic Functions

chap. 2

Finally, we illustrate how the theorem in Sec. 24 can be used to obtain other
properties of analytic functions.
EXAMPLE 3.

Suppose that a function
f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)

and its conjugate
f (z) = u(x, y) − iv(x, y)
are both analytic in a given domain D. It is now easy to show that f (z) must be
constant throughout D.
To do this, we write f (z) as
f (z) = U (x, y) + iV (x, y)
where
(1)

U (x, y) = u(x, y)

and V (x, y) = −v(x, y).

Because of the analyticity of f (z), the Cauchy–Riemann equations
(2)

ux = vy ,

uy = −vx

hold in D; and the analyticity of f (z) in D tells us that
(3)

Ux = Vy ,

Uy = −Vx .

In view of relations (1), equations (3) can also be written
(4)

ux = −vy ,

uy = vx .

By adding corresponding sides of the first of equations (2) and (4), we find that
ux = 0 in D. Similarly, subtraction involving corresponding sides of the second of
equations (2) and (4) reveals that vx = 0. According to expression (8) in Sec. 21,
then,
f  (z) = ux + ivx = 0 + i0 = 0 ;
and it follows from the theorem in Sec. 24 that f (z) is constant throughout D.
EXAMPLE 4. As in Example 3, we consider a function f that is analytic
throughout a given domain D. Assuming further that the modulus |f (z)| is constant
throughout D, one can prove that f (z) must be constant there too. This result is
needed to obtain an important result later on in Chap. 4 (Sec. 54).
The proof is accomplished by writing
(5)

|f (z)| = c

for all z in D,

sec. 25

Exercises

77

where c is a real constant. If c = 0, it follows that f (z) = 0 everywhere in D. If
c = 0, the fact that (see Sec. 5)
f (z)f (z) = c2
tells us that f (z) is never zero in D. Hence
f (z) =

c2
f (z)

for all z in D,

and it follows from this that f (z) is analytic everywhere in D. The main result in
Example 3 just above thus ensures that f (z) is constant throughout D.

26. HARMONIC FUNCTIONS
A real-valued function H of two real variables x and y is said to be harmonic in a
given domain of the xy plane if, throughout that domain, it has continuous partial
derivatives of the first and second order and satisfies the partial differential equation
Hxx (x, y) + Hyy (x, y) = 0,

(1)

known as Laplace’s equation.
Harmonic functions play an important role in applied mathematics. For
example, the temperatures T (x, y) in thin plates lying in the xy plane are often
harmonic. A function V (x, y) is harmonic when it denotes an electrostatic potential
that varies only with x and y in the interior of a region of three-dimensional space
that is free of charges.
EXAMPLE 1. It is easy to verify that the function T (x, y) = e−y sin x is
harmonic in any domain of the xy plane and, in particular, in the semi-infinite
vertical strip 0 < x < π, y > 0. It also assumes the values on the edges of the strip
that are indicated in Fig. 31. More precisely, it satisfies all of the conditions

lim T (x, y) = 0,

y→∞

which describe steady temperatures T (x, y) in a thin homogeneous plate in the
xy plane that has no heat sources or sinks and is insulated except for the stated
conditions along the edges.
The use of the theory of functions of a complex variable in discovering solutions, such as the one in Example 1, of temperature and other problems is described
in considerable detail later on in Chap. 10 and in parts of chapters following it.∗
That theory is based on the theorem below, which provides a source of harmonic
functions.
Theorem 1. If a function f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is analytic in a domain D,
then its component functions u and v are harmonic in D.
To show this, we need a result that is to be proved in Chap. 4 (Sec. 52). Namely,
if a function of a complex variable is analytic at a point, then its real and imaginary
components have continuous partial derivatives of all orders at that point.
Assuming that f is analytic in D, we start with the observation that the firstorder partial derivatives of its component functions must satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann
equations throughout D:
(2)

ux = vy ,

uy = −vx .

Differentiating both sides of these equations with respect to x, we have
(3)

uxx = vyx ,

uyx = −vxx .

Likewise, differentiation with respect to y yields
(4)

uxy = vyy ,

uyy = −vxy .

Now, by a theorem in advanced calculus,† the continuity of the partial derivatives
of u and v ensures that uyx = uxy and vyx = vxy . It then follows from equations
(3) and (4) that
uxx + uyy = 0 and vxx + vyy = 0.
That is, u and v are harmonic in D.
∗ Another important method is developed in the authors’ “Fourier Series and Boundary Value Prob-

lems,” 7th ed., 2008.
† See, for instance, A. E. Taylor and W. R. Mann, “Advanced Calculus,” 3d ed., pp. 199–201, 1983.

EXAMPLE 2. The function f (z) = e−y sin x − ie−y cos x is entire, as is
shown in Exercise 1 (c), Sec. 25. Hence its real component, which is the temperature
function T (x, y) = e−y sin x in Example 1, must be harmonic in every domain of
the xy plane.

and v(x, y) =

are harmonic throughout any domain in the xy plane that does not contain the origin.
If two given functions u and v are harmonic in a domain D and their first-order
partial derivatives satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations (2) throughout D, then v
is said to be a harmonic conjugate of u. The meaning of the word conjugate here
is, of course, different from that in Sec. 5, where z is defined.
Theorem 2. A function f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is analytic in a domain D
if and only if v is a harmonic conjugate of u.
The proof is easy. If v is a harmonic conjugate of u in D, the theorem in Sec.
22 tells us that f is analytic in D. Conversely, if f is analytic in D, we know from
Theorem 1 that u and v are harmonic in D ; furthermore, in view of the theorem in
Sec. 21, the Cauchy–Riemann equations are satisfied.
The following example shows that if v is a harmonic conjugate of u in some
domain, it is not, in general, true that u is a harmonic conjugate of v there. (See
also Exercises 3 and 4.)
EXAMPLE 4.

Suppose that
u(x, y) = x 2 − y 2

and v(x, y) = 2xy.

Since these are the real and imaginary components, respectively, of the entire function f (z) = z2 , we know that v is a harmonic conjugate of u throughout the plane.
But u cannot be a harmonic conjugate of v since, as verified in Exercise 2(b), Sec.
25, the function 2xy + i(x 2 − y 2 ) is not analytic anywhere.
In Chap. 9 (Sec. 104) we shall show that a function u which is harmonic
in a domain of a certain type always has a harmonic conjugate. Thus, in such
domains, every harmonic function is the real part of an analytic function. It is also
true (Exercise 2) that a harmonic conjugate, when it exists, is unique except for an
additive constant.

sec. 26

EXAMPLE 5. We now illustrate one method of obtaining a harmonic conjugate of a given harmonic function. The function
u(x, y) = y 3 − 3x 2 y

(5)

is readily seen to be harmonic throughout the entire xy plane. Since a harmonic
conjugate v(x, y) is related to u(x, y) by means of the Cauchy–Riemann equations
ux = v y ,

(6)

uy = −vx ,

the first of these equations tells us that
vy (x, y) = −6xy.
Holding x fixed and integrating each side here with respect to y, we find that
v(x, y) = −3xy 2 + φ(x)

(7)

where φ is, at present, an arbitrary function of x. Using the second of equations (6),
we have
3y 2 − 3x 2 = 3y 2 − φ  (x),
or φ  (x) = 3x 2 . Thus φ(x) = x 3 + C, where C is an arbitrary real number. According to equation (7), then, the function
v(x, y) = −3xy 2 + x 3 + C

(8)

is a harmonic conjugate of u(x, y).
The corresponding analytic function is
f (z) = (y 3 − 3x 2 y) + i(−3xy 2 + x 3 + C).

(9)

The form f (z) = i(z3 + C) of this function is easily verified and is suggested by
noting that when y = 0, expression (9) becomes f (x) = i(x 3 + C).

5. Let the function f (z) = u(r, θ) + iv(r, θ) be analytic in a domain D that does not

u(r, θ) satisfies the partial differential equation
r 2 urr (r, θ) + rur (r, θ) + uθθ (r, θ) = 0,
which is the polar form of Laplace’s equation. Show that the same is true of the

6. Verify that the function u(r, θ) = ln r is harmonic in the domain r > 0, 0 < θ < 2π

equations in polar form (Sec. 23), to derive the harmonic conjugate v(r, θ) = θ. (Compare with Exercise 6, Sec. 25.)
7. Let the function f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) be analytic in a domain D, and consider the

real constants. Prove that these families are orthogonal. More precisely, show that if
z0 = (x0 , y0 ) is a point in D which is common to two particular curves u(x, y) = c1
and v(x, y) = c2 and if f  (z0 ) = 0, then the lines tangent to those curves at (x0 , y0 )
are perpendicular.

We conclude this chapter with two sections dealing with how the values of an analytic function in a domain D are affected by its values in a subdomain of D or on a
line segment lying in D. While these sections are of considerable theoretical interest, they are not central to our development of analytic functions in later chapters.
The reader may pass directly to Chap. 3 at this time and refer back when necessary.
Lemma.

Suppose that

(a) a function f is analytic throughout a domain D;
(b) f (z) = 0 at each point z of a domain or line segment contained in D.
Then f (z) ≡ 0 in D; that is, f (z) is identically equal to zero throughout D.
To prove this lemma, we let f be as stated in its hypothesis and let z0 be any
point of the subdomain or line segment where f (z) = 0. Since D is a connected
open set (Sec. 11), there is a polygonal line L, consisting of a finite number of
line segments joined end to end and lying entirely in D, that extends from z0 to
any other point P in D. We let d be the shortest distance from points on L to the
boundary of D, unless D is the entire plane; in that case, d may be any positive
number. We then form a finite sequence of points
z0 , z1 , z2 , . . . , zn−1 , zn
along L, where the point zn coincides with P (Fig. 33) and where each point is
sufficiently close to adjacent ones that
|zk − zk−1 | < d

Finally, we construct a finite sequence of neighborhoods
N0 , N1 , N2 , . . . , Nn−1 , Nn ,
where each neighborhood Nk is centered at zk and has radius d. Note that these
neighborhoods are all contained in D and that the center zk of any neighborhood
Nk (k = 1, 2, . . . , n) lies in the preceding neighborhood Nk−1 .
At this point, we need to use a result that is proved later on in Chap. 6. Namely,
Theorem 3 in Sec. 75 tells us that since f is analytic in N0 and since f (z) = 0 in
a domain or on a line segment containing z0 , then f (z) ≡ 0 in N0 . But the point z1
lies in N0 . Hence a second application of the same theorem reveals that f (z) ≡ 0
in N1 ; and, by continuing in this manner, we arrive at the fact that f (z) ≡ 0 in Nn .
Since Nn is centered at the point P and since P was arbitrarily selected in D, we
may conclude that f (z) ≡ 0 in D. This completes the proof of the lemma.
Suppose now that two functions f and g are analytic in the same domain D
and that f (z) = g(z) at each point z of some domain or line segment contained in
D. The difference
h(z) = f (z) − g(z)
is also analytic in D, and h(z) = 0 throughout the subdomain or along the line
segment. According to the lemma, then, h(z) ≡ 0 throught D ; that is, f (z) = g(z) at
each point z in D. We thus arrive at the following important theorem.
Theorem. A function that is analytic in a domain D is uniquely determined
over D by its values in a domain, or along a line segment, contained in D.
This theorem is useful in studying the question of extending the domain of
definition of an analytic function. More precisely, given two domains D1 and D2 ,
consider the intersection D1 ∩ D2 , consisting of all points that lie in both D1 and
D2 . If D1 and D2 have points in common (see Fig. 34) and a function f1 is analytic
in D1 , there may exist a function f2 , which is analytic in D2 , such that f2 (z) = f1 (z)
for each z in the intersection D1 ∩ D2 . If so, we call f2 an analytic continuation of
f1 into the second domain D2 .
Whenever that analytic continuation exists, it is unique, according to the
theorem just proved. That is, not more than one function can be analytic in D2 and
assume the value f1 (z) at each point z of the domain D1 ∩ D2 interior to D2 . However, if there is an analytic continuation f3 of f2 from D2 into a domain D3 which

FIGURE 34

intersects D1 , as indicated in Fig. 34, it is not necessarily true that f3 (z) = f1 (z)
for each z in D1 ∩ D3 . Exercise 2, Sec. 28, illustrates this.
If f2 is the analytic continuation of f1 from a domain D1 into a domain D2 ,
then the function F defined by means of the equations
F (z) =

f1 (z)
f2 (z)

when z is in D1 ,
when z is in D2

is analytic in the union D1 ∪ D2 , which is the domain consisting of all points that
lie in either D1 or D2 . The function F is the analytic continuation into D1 ∪ D2 of
either f1 or f2 ; and f1 and f2 are called elements of F .

28. REFLECTION PRINCIPLE
The theorem in this section concerns the fact that some analytic functions possess
the property that f (z) = f (z) for all points z in certain domains, while others do
not. We note, for example, that the functions z + 1 and z2 have that property when
D is the entire finite plane; but the same is not true of z + i and iz2 . The theorem
here, which is known as the reflection principle, provides a way of predicting when
f (z) = f (z).
Theorem. Suppose that a function f is analytic in some domain D which
contains a segment of the x axis and whose lower half is the reflection of the upper
half with respect to that axis. Then
(1)

f (z) = f (z)

for each point z in the domain if and only if f (x) is real for each point x on the
segment.
We start the proof by assuming that f (x) is real at each point x on the segment.
Once we show that the function
(2)

F (z) = f (z)

86

Analytic Functions

chap. 2

is analytic in D, we shall use it to obtain equation (1). To establish the analyticity
of F (z), we write
f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y),

F (z) = U (x, y) + iV (x, y)

and observe how it follows from equation (2) that since
(3)

f (z) = u(x, −y) − iv(x, −y),

the components of F (z) and f (z) are related by the equations
(4)

U (x, y) = u(x, t)

and V (x, y) = −v(x, t),

where t = −y. Now, because f (x + it) is an analytic function of x + it, the
first-order partial derivatives of the functions u(x, t) and v(x, t) are continuous
throughout D and satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations∗
(5)

ux = vt ,

ut = −vx .

Furthermore, in view of equations (4),
Ux = ux ,

Vy = −vt

dt
= vt ;
dy

and it follows from these and the first of equations (5) that Ux = Vy . Similarly,
Uy = ut

dt
= −ut ,
dy

Vx = −vx ;

and the second of equations (5) tells us that Uy = −Vx . Inasmuch as the firstorder partial derivatives of U (x, y) and V (x, y) are now shown to satisfy the
Cauchy–Riemann equations and since those derivatives are continuous, we find
that the function F (z) is analytic in D. Moreover, since f (x) is real on the segment
of the real axis lying in D, we know that v(x, 0) = 0 on the segment; and, in view
of equations (4), this means that
F (x) = U (x, 0) + iV (x, 0) = u(x, 0) − iv(x, 0) = u(x, 0).
That is,
(6)

F (z) = f (z)

at each point on the segment. According to the theorem in Sec. 27, which tells
us that an analytic function defined on a domain D is uniquely determined by its
∗ See the paragraph immediately following Theorem 1 in Sec. 26.

sec. 28

Exercises

87

values along any line segment lying in D, it follows that equation (6) actually holds
throughout D. Because of definition (2) of the function F (z), then,
f (z) = f (z) ;

(7)

and this is the same as equation (1).
To prove the converse in the theorem, we assume that equation (1) holds and
note that in view of expression (3), the form (7) of equation (1) can be written
u(x, −y) − iv(x, −y) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y).
In particular, if (x, 0) is a point on the segment of the real axis that lies in D,
u(x, 0) − iv(x, 0) = u(x, 0) + iv(x, 0);
and, by equating imaginary parts here, we see that v(x, 0) = 0. Hence f (x) is real
on the segment of the real axis lying in D.
EXAMPLES. Just prior to the statement of the theorem, we noted that
z + 1 = z + 1 and z2 = z2
for all z in the finite plane. The theorem tells us, of course, that this is true, since
x + 1 and x 2 are real when x is real. We also noted that z + i and iz2 do not have
the reflection property throughout the plane, and we now know that this is because
x + i and ix 2 are not real when x is real.

EXERCISES
1. Use the theorem in Sec. 27 to show that if f (z) is analytic and not constant throughout
a domain D, then it cannot be constant throughout any neighborhood lying in D.
Suggestion: Suppose that f (z) does have a constant value w0 throughout some
neighborhood in D.

CHAPTER

3
ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS

We consider here various elementary functions studied in calculus and define corresponding functions of a complex variable. To be specific, we define analytic
functions of a complex variable z that reduce to the elementary functions in calculus
when z = x + i0. We start by defining the complex exponential function and then
use it to develop the others.

29. THE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION
As anticipated earlier (Sec. 14), we define here the exponential function e z by writing
(1)

ez = ex eiy

(z = x + iy),

where Euler’s formula (see Sec. 6)
(2)

eiy = cos y + i sin y

is used and y is to be taken in radians. We see from this definition that ez reduces
to the usual exponential function in calculus when y = 0 ; and, following the convention used in calculus, we often write exp
z for e z .
√
n
Note that since the positive nth root e of e is assigned to ex when x = 1/n
(n
= 2, 3, . . .), expression (1) tells us that the complex exponential function ez is also
√
n
e when z = 1/n (n = 2, 3, . . .). This is an exception to the convention (Sec. 9) that
would ordinarily require us to interpret e1/n as the set of nth roots of e.

chap. 3

According to definition (1), ex eiy = ex+iy ; and, as already pointed out in
Sec. 14, the definition is suggested by the additive property
ex1 ex2 = ex1 +x2
of ex in calculus. That property’s extension,
ez1 ez2 = ez1 +z2 ,

(3)

to complex analysis is easy to verify. To do this, we write
z1 = x1 + iy1

and z2 = x2 + iy2 .

Then
ez1 ez2 = (ex1 eiy1 )(ex2 eiy2 ) = (ex1 ex2 )(eiy1 eiy2 ).
But x1 and x2 are both real, and we know from Sec. 7 that
eiy1 eiy2 = ei(y1 +y2 ) .
Hence

ez1 ez2 = e(x1 +x2 ) ei(y1 +y2 ) ;

and, since
(x1 + x2 ) + i(y1 + y2 ) = (x1 + iy1 ) + (x2 + iy2 ) = z1 + z2 ,
the right-hand side of this last equation becomes ez1 +z2 . Property (3) is now established.
Observe how property (3) enables us to write e z1 −z2 ez2 = ez1 , or
ez1
= ez1 −z2 .
ez2

(4)

From this and the fact that e0 = 1, it follows that 1/ez = e−z .
There are a number of other important properties of e z that are expected.
According to Example 1 in Sec. 22, for instance,
d z
e = ez
dz

(5)

everywhere in the z plane. Note that the differentiability of e z for all z tells us that
ez is entire (Sec. 24). It is also true that
(6)

ez = 0 for any complex number z.

This is evident upon writing definition (1) in the form
ez = ρeiφ

where ρ = ex and φ = y,

The Exponential Function

which tells us that
|ez | = ex

(7)

and

arg(ez ) = y + 2nπ (n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

Statement (6) then follows from the observation that |ez | is always positive.
Some properties of ez are, however, not expected. For example, since
ez+2πi = ez e2πi

and e2πi = 1,

we find that ez is periodic, with a pure imaginary period of 2πi:
ez+2πi = ez .

(8)

For another property of e z that ex does not have, we note that while ex is
always positive, ez can be negative. We recall (Sec. 6), for instance, that e iπ = −1.
In fact,
ei(2n+1)π = ei2nπ+iπ = ei2nπ eiπ = (1)(−1) = −1

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

There are, moreover, values of z such that e z is any given nonzero complex number.
This is shown in the next section, where the logarithmic function is developed, and
is illustrated in the following example.
EXAMPLE. In order to find numbers z = x + iy such that
ez = 1 + i,

(9)
we write equation (9) as

ex eiy =

√ iπ/4

equality of two nonzero complex numbers in exponential form,
ex =

when z = 0 and writing (e z )n = (1/ez )m . Then use the result in part (a), together
with the property 1/e z = e−z (Sec. 29) of the exponential function.

30. THE LOGARITHMIC FUNCTION
Our motivation for the definition of the logarithmic function is based on solving the
equation
ew = z

(1)

for w, where z is any nonzero complex number. To do this, we note that when z
and w are written z = rei (−π <  ≤ π) and w = u + iv, equation (1) becomes
eu eiv = rei .
According to the statement in italics at the beginning of Sec. 9 about the equality
of two complex numbers expressed in exponential form, this tells us that
eu = r

and v =  + 2nπ

where n is any integer. Since the equation e u = r is the same as u = ln r, it follows
that equation (1) is satisfied if and only if w has one of the values
w = ln r + i( + 2nπ)

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

Thus, if we write
(2)

log z = ln r + i( + 2nπ)

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .),

equation (1) tells us that
elog z = z

(3)

(z = 0),

which serves to motivate expression (2) as the definition of the (multiple-valued)
logarithmic function of a nonzero complex variable z = rei .
√
If z = −1 − 3i, then r = 2 and  = −2π/3. Hence

It should be emphasized that it is not true that the left-hand side of equation
(3) with the order of the exponential and logarithmic functions reversed reduces to
just z. More precisely, since expression (2) can be written
log z = ln |z| + i arg z
and since (Sec. 29)
|ez | = ex

and

arg(ez ) = y + 2nπ (n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .)

when z = x + iy, we know that
log(ez ) = ln |ez | + i arg(ez ) = ln(ex ) + i(y + 2nπ) = (x + iy) + 2nπi
(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).
That is,
(4)

log(ez ) = z + 2nπi

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

The principal value of log z is the value obtained from equation (2) when n = 0
there and is denoted by Log z. Thus
Log z = ln r + i.

(5)

Note that Log z is well defined and single-valued when z = 0 and that
(6)

log z = Log z + 2nπi

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

It reduces to the usual logarithm in calculus when z is a positive real number z = r.
To see this, one need only write z = rei0 , in which case equation (5) becomes
Log z = ln r. That is, Log r = ln r.
EXAMPLE 2. From expression (2), we find that
log 1 = ln 1 + i(0 + 2nπ) = 2nπi

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

As anticipated, Log 1 = 0.
Our final example here reminds us that although we were unable to find logarithms of negative real numbers in calculus, we can now do so.
EXAMPLE 3. Observe that
log(−1) = ln 1 + i(π + 2nπ) = (2n + 1)πi
and that Log (−1) = πi.

31. BRANCHES AND DERIVATIVES OF LOGARITHMS
If z = reiθ is a nonzero complex number, the argument θ has any one of the values
θ =  + 2nπ (n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .), where  = Arg z. Hence the definition
log z = ln r + i( + 2nπ)

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .)

of the multiple-valued logarithmic function in Sec. 30 can be written
log z = ln r + iθ.

(1)

If we let α denote any real number and restrict the value of θ in expression (1)
so that α < θ < α + 2π, the function
(2)

log z = ln r + iθ

(r > 0, α < θ < α + 2π),

with components
u(r, θ ) = ln r

(3)

and v(r, θ ) = θ,

is single-valued and continuous in the stated domain (Fig. 35). Note that if the
function (2) were to be defined on the ray θ = α, it would not be continuous there.
For if z is a point on that ray, there are points arbitrarily close to z at which the
values of v are near α and also points such that the values of v are near α + 2π.

The function (2) is not only continuous but also analytic throughout the domain

In particular,
(5)

A branch of a multiple-valued function f is any single-valued function F that
is analytic in some domain at each point z of which the value F (z) is one of the
values of f . The requirement of analyticity, of course, prevents F from taking on a
random selection of the values of f . Observe that for each fixed α, the single-valued
function (2) is a branch of the multiple-valued function (1). The function
Log z = ln r + i

(6)

(r > 0, −π <  < π)

is called the principal branch.
A branch cut is a portion of a line or curve that is introduced in order to define
a branch F of a multiple-valued function f . Points on the branch cut for F are
singular points (Sec. 24) of F , and any point that is common to all branch cuts of f
is called a branch point. The origin and the ray θ = α make up the branch cut for
the branch (2) of the logarithmic function. The branch cut for the principal branch
(6) consists of the origin and the ray  = π. The origin is evidently a branch point
for branches of the multiple-valued logarithmic function.
Special care must be taken in using branches of the logarithmic function, especially since expected identities involving logarithms do not always carry over from
calculus.

In Sec. 32, we shall derive some identities involving logarithms that do carry
over from calculus, sometimes with qualifications as to how they are to be interpreted. A reader who wishes to pass to Sec. 33 can simply refer to results in Sec. 32

32. SOME IDENTITIES INVOLVING LOGARITHMS
If z1 and z2 denote any two nonzero complex numbers, it is straightforward to show
that
(1)

log(z1 z2 ) = log z1 + log z2 .

This statement, involving a multiple-valued function, is to be interpreted in the same
way that the statement
(2)

arg(z1 z2 ) = arg z1 + arg z2

was in Sec. 8. That is, if values of two of the three logarithms are specified, then
there is a value of the third such that equation (1) holds.
The verification of statement (1) can be based on statement (2) in the following
way. Since |z1 z2 | = |z1 ||z2 | and since these moduli are all positive real numbers,
we know from experience with logarithms of such numbers in calculus that
ln |z1 z2 | = ln |z1 | + ln |z2 |.
So it follows from this and equation (2) that
(3)

ln |z1 z2 | + i arg(z1 z2 ) = (ln |z1 | + i arg z1 ) + (ln |z2 | + i arg z2 ).

Finally, because of the way in which equations (1) and (2) are to be interpreted,
equation (3) is the same as equation (1).
EXAMPLE. To illustrate statement (1), write z1 = z2 = −1 and recall from
Examples 2 and 3 in Sec. 30 that
log 1 = 2nπi

and

log(−1) = (2n + 1)πi,

where n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . . Noting that z1 z2 = 1 and using the values
log(z1 z2 ) = 0

and

log z1 = πi,

Some Identities Involving Logarithms

we find that equations (1) is satisfied when the value log z2 = −πi is chosen.
If, on the other hand, the principal values
Log 1 = 0 and Log(−1) = πi
are used,
Log(z1 z2 ) = 0 and Log z1 + log z2 = 2πi
for the same numbers z1 and z2 . Thus statement (1), which is sometimes true when
log is replaced by Log (see Exercise 1), is not always true when principal values
are used in all three of its terms.
Verification of the statement
 
z1
log
= log z1 − log z2 ,
(4)
z2
which is to be interpreted in the same way as statement (1), is left to the exercises.
We include here two other properties of log z that will be of special interest in
Sec. 33. If z is a nonzero complex number, then
(5)

zn = en log z

(n = 0 ± 1, ±2, . . .)

for any value of log z that is taken. When n = 1, this reduces, of course, to relation
(3), Sec. 30. Equation (5) is readily verified by writing z = re iθ and noting that
each side becomes r n einθ .
It is also true that when z = 0,



z1/n = exp
(6)

(n = 1, 2, . . .).
n
That is, the term on the right here has n distinct values, and those values are the nth
roots of z. To prove this, we write z = r exp(i), where  is the principal value
of arg z. Then, in view of definition (2), Sec. 30, of log z,

Because exp(i2kπ/n) has distinct values only when k = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1, the righthand side of equation (7) has only n values. That right-hand side is, in fact, an
expression for the nth roots of z (Sec. 9), and so it can be written z1/n . This
establishes property (6), which is actually valid when n is a negative integer too
(see Exercise 5).

Log(z1 z2 ) = Log z1 + Log z2 .
Suggestion: Write 1 = Arg z1 and 2 = Arg z2 . Then observe how it follows
from the stated restrictions on z1 and z2 that −π < 1 + 2 < π.
2. Show that for any two nonzero complex numbers z 1 and z2 ,
Log(z1 z2 ) = Log z1 + Log z2 + 2Nπ i
where N has one of the values 0, ±1. (Compare with Exercise 1.)
3. Verify expression (4), Sec. 32, for log(z1 /z2 ) by
(a) using the fact that arg(z1 /z2 ) = arg z1 − arg z2 (Sec. 8);
(b) showing that log(1/z) = − log z (z = 0), in the sense that log(1/z) and − log z
have the same set of values, and then referring to expression (1), Sec. 32, for
log(z1 z2 ).
4. By choosing specific nonzero values of z1 and z2 , show that expression (4), Sec. 32,
for log(z1 /z2 ) is not always valid when log is replaced by Log.
5. Show that property (6), Sec. 32, also holds when n is a negative integer. Do this
by writing z1/n = (z1/m )−1 (m = −n), where n has any one of the negative values
n = −1, −2, . . . (see Exercise 9, Sec. 10), and using the fact that the property is
already known to be valid for positive integers.
6. Let z denote any nonzero complex number, written z = re i (−π <  ≤ π ), and let
n denote any fixed positive integer (n = 1, 2, . . .). Show that all of the values of

log(z1/n ) =

where q = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . , show that the set of values of log(z1/n ) is the same as the set

to a value of log(z1/n ) taken on the left, the appropriate value of log z is to be selected
on the right, and conversely. [The result in Exercise 5(a), Sec. 31, is a special case of
this one.]
Suggestion: Use the fact that the remainder upon dividing an integer by a positive
integer n is always an integer between 0 and n − 1, inclusive; that is, when a positive
integer n is specified, any integer q can be written q = pn + k, where p is an integer
and k has one of the values k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1.

33. COMPLEX EXPONENTS
When z = 0 and the exponent c is any complex number, the function zc is defined
by means of the equation
zc = ec log z ,

(1)

where log z denotes the multiple-valued logarithmic function. Equation (1) provides
a consistent definition of zc in the sense that it is already known to be valid (see
Sec. 32) when c = n (n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .) and c = 1/n (n = ±1, ±2, . . .). Definition (1) is, in fact, suggested by those particular choices of c.
EXAMPLE 1.

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

This shows that
(2)

i −2i = exp[(4n + 1)π]

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

Note that these values of i −2i are all real numbers.
Since the exponential function has the property 1/ez = e−z (Sec. 29), one can
see that

If z = reiθ and α is any real number, the branch
log z = ln r + iθ

(r > 0, α < θ < α + 2π)

of the logarithmic function is single-valued and analytic in the indicated domain
(Sec. 31). When that branch is used, it follows that the function zc = exp(c log z)
is single-valued and analytic in the same domain. The derivative of such a branch
of zc is found by first using the chain rule to write

Thus
(z1 z2 )i = z1i z2i ,

(8)

as might be expected.
On the other hand, continuing to use principal values, we see that
(z2 z3 )i = (−2)i = eiLog(−2) = ei(ln 2+iπ) = e−π ei ln 2
and
z3i = eiLog(−1−i) = ei(ln

or
(9)

(z2 z3 )i = z2i z3i e−2π .

According to definition (1), the exponential function with base c, where c is
any nonzero complex constant, is written
(10)

cz = ez log c .

Note that although ez is, in general, multiple-valued according to definition (10),
the usual interpretation of ez occurs when the principal value of the logarithm is
taken. This is because the principal value of log e is unity.
When a value of log c is specified, c z is an entire function of z. In fact,

It is, therefore, natural to define the sine and cosine functions of a complex variable
z as follows:
(1)

sin z =

eiz − e−iz
2i

and

cos z =

eiz + e−iz
.

cos(−z) = cos z.

Also,
(4)

eiz = cos z + i sin z.

This is, of course, Euler’s formula (Sec. 6) when z is real.
A variety of identities carry over from trigonometry. For instance (see Exercises
2 and 3),
(5)

sin(z1 + z2 ) = sin z1 cos z2 + cos z1 sin z2 ,

(6)

cos(z1 + z2 ) = cos z1 cos z2 − sin z1 sin z2 .

cos(z + 2π) = cos z,

When y is any real number, definitions (1) and the hyperbolic functions
sinhy =

ey − e−y
2

and coshy =

ey + e−y
2

from calculus can be used to write
(12)

sin(iy) = i sinhy

and

cos(iy) = coshy.

Also, the real and imaginary components of sin z and cos z can be displayed in
terms of those hyperbolic functions:
(13)

sin z = sin x cosh y + i cos x sinh y,

(14)

cos z = cos x cosh y − i sin x sinh y,

where z = x + iy. To obtain expressions (13) and (14), we write
z1 = x

and z2 = iy

in identities (5) and (6) and then refer to relations (12). Observe that once expression (13) is obtained, relation (14) also follows from the fact (Sec. 21) that if the
derivative of a function
f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)
exists at a point z = (x, y), then
f  (z) = ux (x, y) + ivx (x, y).
Expressions (13) and (14) can be used (Exercise 7) to show that
(15)

| sin z|2 = sin2 x + sinh2 y,

(16)

| cos z|2 = cos2 x + sinh2 y.

Inasmuch as sinh y tends to infinity as y tends to infinity, it is clear from these two
equations that sin z and cos z are not bounded on the complex plane, whereas the
absolute values of sin x and cos x are less than or equal to unity for all values of x.
(See the definition of a bounded function at the end of Sec. 18.)
A zero of a given function f (z) is a number z0 such that f (z0 ) = 0. Since sin z
becomes the usual sine function in calculus when z is real, we know that the real
numbers z = nπ (n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .) are all zeros of sin z. To show that there are
no other zeros, we assume that sin z = 0 and note how it follows from equation (15)
that
sin2 x + sinh2 y = 0.
This sum of two squares reveals that
sin x = 0 and

sinh y = 0.

which are the zeros of cos z. Likewise, cot z and csc z have singularities at the zeros

sin z =

cos z =

of sin z and cos z, the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions are closely related to
those trigonometric functions:
(3)

−i sinh(iz) = sin z,

cosh(iz) = cos z,

(4)

−i sin(iz) = sinh z,

cos(iz) = cosh z.

Some of the most frequently used identities involving hyperbolic sine and
cosine functions are
(5)

sinh(−z) = − sinh z,

cosh(−z) = cosh z,

(6)

cosh2 z − sinh2 z = 1,

(7)

sinh(z1 + z2 ) = sinh z1 cosh z2 + cosh z1 sinh z2 ,

(8)

cosh(z1 + z2 ) = cosh z1 cosh z2 + sinh z1 sinh z2

and
(9)

sinh z = sinh x cos y + i cosh x sin y,

(10)

cosh z = cosh x cos y + i sinh x sin y,

(11)

|sinh z|2 = sinh2 x + sin2 y,

(12)

|cosh z|2 = sinh2 x + cos2 y,

where z = x + iy. While these identities follow directly from definitions (1), they
are often more easily obtained from related trigonometric identities, with the aid of
relations (3) and (4).
EXAMPLE. To illustrate the method of proof just suggested, let us verify
identity (11). According to the first of relations (4), |sinh z|2 = |sin(iz)|2 . That is,
(13)

|sinh z|2 = |sin(−y + ix)|2 ,

where z = x + iy. But from equation (15), Sec. 34, we know that
|sin(x + iy)|2 = sin2 x + sinh2 y ;
and this enables us to write equation (13) in the desired form (11).

that
eiw = iz + (1 − z2 )1/2

where (1 − z2 )1/2 is, of course, a double-valued function of z. Taking logarithms of
each side of equation (1) and recalling that w = sin−1 z, we arrive at the expression
sin−1 z = −i log[iz + (1 − z2 )1/2 ].

INTEGRALS

Integrals are extremely important in the study of functions of a complex variable.
The theory of integration, to be developed in this chapter, is noted for its mathematical elegance. The theorems are generally concise and powerful, and many of
the proofs are short.

37. DERIVATIVES OF FUNCTIONS w (t)
In order to introduce integrals of f (z) in a fairly simple way, we need to first
consider derivatives of complex-valued functions w of a real variable t. We write
(1)

w(t) = u(t) + iv(t),

where the functions u and v are real-valued functions of t. The derivative
d
w (t), or
w(t),
dt
of the function (1) at a point t is defined as
(2)

w (t) = u (t) + iv  (t),

provided each of the derivatives u and v  exists at t.
From definition (2), it follows that for every complex constant z0 = x0 + iy0 ,
d
[z0 w(t)] = [(x0 + iy0 )(u + iv)] = [(x0 u − y0 v) + i(y0 u + x0 v)]
dt
= (x0 u − y0 v) + i(y0 u + x0 v) = (x0 u − y0 v  ) + i(y0 u + x0 v  ).

117

118

Integrals

But

chap. 4

(x0 u − y0 v  ) + i(y0 u + x0 v  ) = (x0 + iy0 )(u + iv  ) = z0 w (t),

and so
(3)

d
[z0 w(t)] = z0 w (t).
dt
Another expected rule that we shall often use is

(4)

d z0 t
e = z0 ez0 t,
dt

where z0 = x0 + iy0 . To verify this, we write
ez0 t = ex0 t eiy0 t = ex0 t cos y0 t + iex0 t sin y0 t
and refer to definition (2) to see that
d z0 t
e = (ex0 t cos y0 t) + i(ex0 t sin y0 t) .
dt
Familiar rules from calculus and some simple algebra then lead us to the expression
d z0 t
e = (x0 + iy0 )(ex0 t cos y0 t + iex0 t sin y0 t),
dt
or

d z0 t
e = (x0 + iy0 )ex0 t eiy0 t.
dt

This is, of course, the same as equation (4).
Various other rules learned in calculus, such as the ones for differentiating
sums and products, apply just as they do for real-valued functions of t. As was the
case with property (3) and formula (4), verifications may be based on corresponding
rules in calculus. It should be pointed out, however, that not every such rule carries
over to functions of type (1). The following example illustrates this.
EXAMPLE. Suppose that w(t) is continuous on an interval a ≤ t ≤ b; that
is, its component functions u(t) and v(t) are continuous there. Even if w (t) exists
when a < t < b, the mean value theorem for derivatives no longer applies. To be
precise, it is not necessarily true that there is a number c in the interval a < t < b
such that
w(b) − w(a)
w (c) =
.
b−a
To see this, consider the function w(t) = eit on the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. When that
function is used, |w (t)| = |ieit | = 1; and this means that the derivative w (t) is
never zero, while w(2π) − w(0) = 0.

38. DEFINITE INTEGRALS OF FUNCTIONS w(t)
When w(t) is a complex-valued function of a real variable t and is written
w(t) = u(t) + iv(t),

where u and v are real-valued, the definite integral of w(t) over an interval a ≤ t ≤ b
is defined as

Improper integrals of w(t) over unbounded intervals are defined in a similar way.
The existence of the integrals of u and v in definition (2) is ensured if those
functions are piecewise continuous on the interval a ≤ t ≤ b. Such a function is
continuous everywhere in the stated interval except possibly for a finite number of
points where, although discontinuous, it has one-sided limits. Of course, only the
right-hand limit is required at a; and only the left-hand limit is required at b. When
both u and v are piecewise continuous, the function w is said to have that property.
Anticipated rules for integrating a complex constant times a function w(t), for
integrating sums of such functions, and for interchanging limits of integration are
all valid. Those rules, as well as the property
 b
 c
 b
w(t) dt =
w(t) dt +

are easy to verify by recalling corresponding results in calculus.
The fundamental theorem of calculus, involving antiderivatives, can, moreover,
be extended so as to apply to integrals of the type (2). To be specific, suppose that
the functions
w(t) = u(t) + iv(t)

and W (t) = U (t) + iV (t)

are continuous on the interval a ≤ t ≤ b. If W  (t) = w(t) when a ≤ t ≤ b, then
U  (t) = u(t) and V  (t) = v(t). Hence, in view of definition (2),

We recall from the example in Sec. 37 how the mean value theorem for derivatives in calculus does not carry over to complex-valued functions w(t). Our final
example here shows that the mean value theorem for integrals does not carry over
either. Thus special care must continue to be used in applying rules from calculus.
EXAMPLE 3. Let w(t) be a continuous complex-valued function of t defined
on an interval a ≤ t ≤ b. In order to show that it is not necessarily true that there
is a number c in the interval a < t < b such that
 b
w(t) dt = w(c)(b − a),
a

we write a = 0, b = 2π and use the same function w(t) = eit (0 ≤ t ≤ 2π) as in
the example in Sec. 37. It is easy to see that

and this means that w(c)(b − a) is not zero.

39. CONTOURS
Integrals of complex-valued functions of a complex variable are defined on curves
in the complex plane, rather than on just intervals of the real line. Classes of curves
that are adequate for the study of such integrals are introduced in this section.
A set of points z = (x, y) in the complex plane is said to be an arc if
x = x(t),

(1)

y = y(t)

(a ≤ t ≤ b),

where x(t) and y(t) are continuous functions of the real parameter t. This definition
establishes a continuous mapping of the interval a ≤ t ≤ b into the xy, or z, plane;
and the image points are ordered according to increasing values of t. It is convenient
to describe the points of C by means of the equation
z = z(t)

(2)

(a ≤ t ≤ b),

where
z(t) = x(t) + iy(t).

(3)

The arc C is a simple arc, or a Jordan arc,∗ if it does not cross itself ; that is,
C is simple if z(t1 ) = z(t2 ) when t1 = t2 . When the arc C is simple except for the
fact that z(b) = z(a), we say that C is a simple closed curve, or a Jordan curve.
Such a curve is positively oriented when it is in the counterclockwise direction.
The geometric nature of a particular arc often suggests different notation for
the parameter t in equation (2). This is, in fact, the case in the following examples.

EXAMPLE 2.

The unit circle

about the origin is a simple closed curve, oriented in the counterclockwise direction.
So is the circle
z = z0 + Reiθ

(6)

(0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π),

centered at the point z0 and with radius R (see Sec. 6).
The same set of points can make up different arcs.
EXAMPLE 3.

The arc
z = e−iθ

(7)

(0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π)

is not the same as the arc described by equation (5). The set of points is the same,
but now the circle is traversed in the clockwise direction.
EXAMPLE 4.

The points on the arc
z = ei2θ

(8)

(0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π)

are the same as those making up the arcs (5) and (7). The arc here differs, however,
from each of those arcs since the circle is traversed twice in the counterclockwise
direction.
The parametric representation used for any given arc C is, of course, not unique.
It is, in fact, possible to change the interval over which the parameter ranges to any
other interval. To be specific, suppose that
t = φ(τ )

(9)

(α ≤ τ ≤ β),

where φ is a real-valued function mapping an interval α ≤ τ ≤ β onto the interval
a ≤ t ≤ b in representation (2). (See Fig. 37.) We assume that φ is continuous with

a continuous derivative. We also assume that φ  (τ ) > 0 for each τ ; this ensures that
t increases with τ . Representation (2) is then transformed by equation (9) into
(10)

z = Z(τ )

(α ≤ τ ≤ β),

where
(11)

Z(τ ) = z[φ(τ )].

This is illustrated in Exercise 3.
Suppose now that the components x  (t) and y  (t) of the derivative (Sec. 37)
(12)

z (t) = x  (t) + iy  (t)

of the function (3), used to represent C, are continuous on the entire interval a ≤ t ≤ b.
The arc is then called a differentiable arc, and the real-valued function

|z (t)| = [x  (t)]2 + [y  (t)]2
is integrable over the interval a ≤ t ≤ b. In fact, according to the definition of arc
length in calculus, the length of C is the number
 b
L=
(13)
|z (t)| dt.
a

The value of L is invariant under certain changes in the representation for
C that is used, as one would expect. More precisely, with the change of variable
indicated in equation (9), expression (13) takes the form [see Exercise 1(b)]
 β
L=
|z [φ(τ )]|φ  (τ ) dτ.
α

So, if representation (10) is used for C, the derivative (Exercise 4)
(14)

Z  (τ ) = z [φ(τ )]φ  (τ )

enables us to write expression (13) as
 β
|Z  (τ )| dτ.
L=
α

Thus the same length of C would be obtained if representation (10) were to be used.
If equation (2) represents a differentiable arc and if z (t) = 0 anywhere in the
interval a < t < b, then the unit tangent vector
T=

z (t)
|z (t)|

is well defined for all t in that open interval, with angle of inclination arg z (t). Also,
when T turns, it does so continuously as the parameter t varies over the entire interval

a < t < b. This expression for T is the one learned in calculus when z(t) is interpreted as a radius vector. Such an arc is said to be smooth. In referring to a smooth
arc z = z(t) (a ≤ t ≤ b), then, we agree that the derivative z (t) is continuous on the
closed interval a ≤ t ≤ b and nonzero throughout the open interval a < t < b.
A contour, or piecewise smooth arc, is an arc consisting of a finite number of
smooth arcs joined end to end. Hence if equation (2) represents a contour, z(t) is
continuous, whereas its derivative z (t) is piecewise continuous. The polygonal line
(4) is, for example, a contour. When only the initial and final values of z(t) are
the same, a contour C is called a simple closed contour. Examples are the circles
(5) and (6), as well as the boundary of a triangle or a rectangle taken in a specific
direction. The length of a contour or a simple closed contour is the sum of the
lengths of the smooth arcs that make up the contour.
The points on any simple closed curve or simple closed contour C are boundary
points of two distinct domains, one of which is the interior of C and is bounded.
The other, which is the exterior of C, is unbounded. It will be convenient to accept
this statement, known as the Jordan curve theorem, as geometrically evident; the
proof is not easy.∗

40. CONTOUR INTEGRALS
We turn now to integrals of complex-valued functions f of the complex variable z.
Such an integral is defined in terms of the values f (z) along a given contour C,
extending from a point z = z1 to a point z = z2 in the complex plane. It is, therefore,
a line integral ; and its value depends, in general, on the contour C as well as on
the function f . It is written


 z2
f (z) dz

or

C

f (z) dz,
z1

the latter notation often being used when the value of the integral is independent
of the choice of the contour taken between two fixed end points. While the integral
may be defined directly as the limit of a sum, we choose to define it in terms of a
definite integral of the type introduced in Sec. 38.
Suppose that the equation
z = z(t)

(1)

(a ≤ t ≤ b)

represents a contour C, extending from a point z1 = z(a) to a point z2 = z(b). We
assume that f [z(t)] is piecewise continuous (Sec. 38) on the interval a ≤ t ≤ b and
refer to the function f (z) as being piecewise continuous on C. We then define the
line integral, or contour integral, of f along C in terms of the parameter t:

f (z) dz =

(2)
C

 b

f [z(t)]z (t) dt.

a

Note that since C is a contour, z (t) is also piecewise continuous on a ≤ t ≤ b; and
so the existence of integral (2) is ensured.
The value of a contour integral is invariant under a change in the representation
of its contour when the change is of the type (11), Sec. 39. This can be seen by
following the same general procedure that was used in Sec. 39 to show the invariance
of arc length.

not zero.) The question of predicting when an integral around a closed contour has

43. UPPER BOUNDS FOR MODULI OF CONTOUR
INTEGRALS
We turn now to an inequality involving contour integrals that is extremely important
in various applications. We present the result as a theorem but preface it with a
needed lemma involving functions w(t) of the type encountered in Secs. 37 and 38.
Lemma. If w(t) is a piecewise continuous complex-valued function defined
on an interval a ≤ t ≤ b, then
 b
  b




This inequality clearly holds when the value of the integral on the left is zero.
Thus, in the verification we may assume that its value is a nonzero complex number
and write
 b
w(t) dt = r0 eiθ0 .
a

Solving for r0 , we have
(2)

r0 =

 b

e−iθ0 w(t) dt.

a

Now the left-hand side of this equation is a real number, and so the right-hand side
is too. Thus, using the fact that the real part of a real number is the number itself,
we find that
 b
r0 = Re
e−iθ0 w(t) dt,
a

or
(3)

r0 =

 b

Re[e−iθ0 w(t)] dt.

a

But
Re[e−iθ0 w(t)] ≤ |e−iθ0 w(t)| = |e−iθ0 | |w(t)| = |w(t)|,
and it follows from equation (3) that
r0 ≤

 b

|w(t)| dt.

a

Because r0 is, in fact, the left-hand side of inequality (1), the verification of the
lemma is complete.

Since the integral on the right here represents the length L of C (see Sec. 39),
inequality (5) is established. It is, of course, a strict inequality if inequality (4) is
strict.
Note that since C is a contour and f is piecewise continuous on C, a number M
such as the one appearing in inequality (4) will always exist. This is because the realvalued function |f [z(t)]| is continuous on the closed bounded interval a ≤ t ≤ b
when f is continuous on C; and such a function always reaches a maximum value
M on that interval.∗ Hence |f (z)| has a maximum value on C when f is continuous
on it. The same is, then, true when f is piecewise continuous on C.
EXAMPLE 1. Let C be the arc of the circle |z| = 2 from z = 2 to z = 2i
that lies in the first quadrant (Fig. 46). Inequality (5) can be used to show that

44. ANTIDERIVATIVES
Although the value of a contour integral of a function f (z) from a fixed point z1
to a fixed point z2 depends, in general, on the path that is taken, there are certain
functions whose integrals from z1 to z2 have values that are independent of path.
(Recall Examples 2 and 3 in Sec. 41.) The examples just cited also illustrate the
fact that the values of integrals around closed paths are sometimes, but not always,
zero. Our next theorem is useful in determining when integration is independent of
path and, moreover, when an integral around a closed path has value zero.
The theorem contains an extension of the fundamental theorem of calculus
that simplifies the evaluation of many contour integrals. The extension involves the
concept on an antiderivative of a continuous function f (z) on a domain D, or a
function F (z) such that F  (z) = f (z) for all z in D. Note that an antiderivative is, of
necessity, an analytic function. Note, too, that an antiderivative of a given function
f (z) is unique except for an additive constant. This is because the derivative of the
difference F (z) − G(z) of any two such antiderivatives is zero ; and, according to
the theorem in Sec. 24, an analytic function is constant in a domain D when its
derivative is zero throughout D.
Theorem. Suppose that a function f (z) is continuous on a domain D. If any
one of the following statements is true, then so are the others:
(a) f (z) has an antiderivative F (z) throughout D;
(b) the integrals of f (z) along contours lying entirely in D and extending from any
fixed point z1 to any fixed point z2 all have the same value, namely
z2
 z2
f (z) dz = F (z)
= F (z2 ) − F (z1 )
z1

z1

where F (z) is the antiderivative in statement (a);
(c) the integrals of f (z) around closed contours lying entirely in D all have value
zero.
It should be emphasized that the theorem does not claim that any of these
statements is true for a given function f (z). It says only that all of them are true or
that none of them is true. The next section is devoted to the proof of the theorem
and can be easily skipped by a reader who wishes to get on with other important
aspects of integration theory. But we include here a number of examples illustrating
how the theorem can be used.

EXAMPLE 2. The function f (z) = 1/z2 , which is continuous everywhere

consisting of the entire plane with the origin deleted. Consequently,

about the origin.
Note that the integral of the function f (z) = 1/z around the same circle cannot
be evaluated in a similar way. For, although the derivative of any branch F (z) of
log z is 1/z (Sec. 31), F (z) is not differentiable, or even defined, along its branch
cut. In particular, if a ray θ = α from the origin is used to form the branch cut, F  (z)
fails to exist at the point where that ray intersects the circle C (see Fig. 49). So C
does not lie in any domain throughout which F  (z) = 1/z, and one cannot make
direct use of an antiderivative. Example 3, just below, illustrates how a combination
of two different antiderivatives can be used to evaluate f (z) = 1/z around C.

45. PROOF OF THE THEOREM
To prove the theorem in the previous section, it is sufficient to show that statement
(a) implies statement (b), that statement (b) implies statement (c), and finally that
statement (c) implies statement (a).
Let us assume that statement (a) is true, or that f (z) has an antiderivative F (z)
on the domain D being considered. To show how statement (b) follows, we need to
show that integration in independent of path in D and that the fundamental theorem
of calculus can be extended using F (z). If a contour C from z1 to z2 is a smooth
arc lying in D, with parametric representation z = z(t) (a ≤ t ≤ b), we know from
Exercise 5, Sec. 39, that
d
F [z(t)] = F  [z(t)]z (t) = f [z(t)]z (t)
dt

(a ≤ t ≤ b).

Because the fundamental theorem of calculus can be extended so as to apply to
complex-valued functions of a real variable (Sec. 38), it follows that

f (z) dz =
C

 b

f z(t) z (t) dt = F [z(t)]

a

b
= F [z(b)] − F [z(a)].

Since z(b) = z2 and z(a) = z1 , the value of this contour integral is then
F (z2 ) − F (z1 );

sec. 45

Proof of the Theorem

147

and that value is evidently independent of the contour C as long as C extends from
z1 to z2 and lies entirely in D. That is,
z2
 z2
(1)
f (z) dz = F (z2 ) − F (z1 ) = F (z)

when C is smooth. Expression (1) is also valid when C is any contour, not necessarily a smooth one, that lies in D. For, if C consists of a finite number of smooth
arcs Ck (k = 1, 2, . . . , n), each Ck extending from a point zk to a point zk+1 , then

Because the last sum here telescopes to F (zn+1 ) − F (z1 ), we arrive at the expression

f (z) dz = F (zn+1 ) − F (z1 ).
C

(Compare with Example 3, Sec. 41.) The fact that statement (b) follows from statement (a) is now established.
To see that statement (b) implies statement (c), we now show that the value of
any integral around a closed contour in D is zero when integration is independent
of path there. To do this, we let z1 and z2 denote two points on any closed contour
C lying in D and form two paths C1 and C2 , each with initial point z1 and final
point z2 , such that C = C1 − C2 (Fig. 53). Assuming that integration is independent
of path in D, one can write

f (z) dz = 0.

That is, the integral of f (z) around the closed contour C = C1 − C2 has value zero.
It remains to show statement (c) implies statement (a). That is, we need to
show that if integrals of f (z) around closed contours in D always have value zero,

then f (z) has an antiderivative on D. Assuming that the values of such integrals
are in fact zero, we start by showing that integration is independent of path in D.
We let C1 and C2 denote any two contours, lying in D, from a point z1 to a point
z2 and observe that since integrals around closed paths lying in D have value zero,
equation (3) holds (see Fig. 53). Thus equation (2) holds. Integration is, therefore,
independent of path in D ; and we can define the function
 z
F (z) =
f (s) ds
z0

on D. The proof of the theorem is complete once we show that F  (z) = f (z)
everywhere in D. We do this by letting z + z be any point distinct from z and
lying in some neighborhood of z that is small enough to be contained in D. Then

46. CAUCHY–GOURSAT THEOREM
In Sec. 44, we saw that when a continuous function f has an antiderivative in a
domain D, the integral of f (z) around any given closed contour C lying entirely
in D has value zero. In this section, we present a theorem giving other conditions
on a function f which ensure that the value of the integral of f (z) around a simple
closed contour (Sec. 39) is zero. The theorem is central to the theory of functions
of a complex variable; and some modifications of it, involving certain special types
of domains, will be given in Secs. 48 and 49.
We let C denote a simple closed contour z = z(t) (a ≤ t ≤ b), described in the
positive sense (counterclockwise), and we assume that f is analytic at each point
interior to and on C. According to Sec. 40,


and if
f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)

and z(t) = x(t) + iy(t),

the integrand f [z(t)]z (t) in expression (1) is the product of the functions
u[x(t), y(t)] + iv[x(t), y(t)],

x  (t) + iy  (t)

of the real variable t. Thus

Observe that expression (3) can be obtained formally by replacing f (z) and dz on

and dx + i dy,

respectively, and expanding their product. Expression (3) is, of course, also valid
when C is any contour, not necessarily a simple closed one, and when f [z(t)] is
only piecewise continuous on it.
We next recall a result from calculus that enables us to express the line integrals on the right in equation (3) as double integrals. Suppose that two real-valued
functions P (x, y) and Q(x, y), together with their first-order partial derivatives, are
continuous throughout the closed region R consisting of all points interior to and
on the simple closed contour C. According to Green’s theorem,

Now f is continuous in R, since it is analytic there. Hence the functions u and
v are also continuous in R. Likewise, if the derivative f  of f is continuous in R,
so are the first-order partial derivatives of u and v. Green’s theorem then enables
us to rewrite equation (3) as

But, in view of the Cauchy–Riemann equations

uy = −vx ,

the integrands of these two double integrals are zero throughout R. So when f is
analytic in R and f  is continuous there,

(5)
f (z) dz = 0.
C

This result was obtained by Cauchy in the early part of the nineteenth century.
Note that once it has been established that the value of this integral is zero,
the orientation of C is immaterial. That is, statement (5) is also true if C is taken
in the clockwise direction, since then


f (z) dz = −
f (z) dz = 0.

C

EXAMPLE. If C is any simple closed contour, in either direction, then

exp(z3 ) dz = 0.
C

This is because the composite function f (z) = exp(z3 ) is analytic everywhere and
its derivative f  (z) = 3z2 exp(z3 ) is continuous everywhere.
Goursat∗ was the first to prove that the condition of continuity on f  can be
omitted. Its removal is important and will allow us to show, for example, that the
derivative f  of an analytic function f is analytic without having to assume the
continuity of f  , which follows as a consequence. We now state the revised form
of Cauchy’s result, known as the Cauchy–Goursat theorem.
Theorem. If a function f is analytic at all points interior to and on a simple
closed contour C, then

f (z) dz = 0.

The proof is presented in the next section, where, to be specific, we assume
that C is positively oriented. The reader who wishes to accept this theorem without
proof may pass directly to Sec. 48.

47. PROOF OF THE THEOREM
We preface the proof of the Cauchy–Goursat theorem with a lemma. We start by
forming subsets of the region R which consists of the points on a positively oriented
simple closed contour C together with the points interior to C. To do this, we draw
equally spaced lines parallel to the real and imaginary axes such that the distance
between adjacent vertical lines is the same as that between adjacent horizontal lines.
We thus form a finite number of closed square subregions, where each point of R lies
in at least one such subregion and each subregion contains points of R. We refer to
these square subregions simply as squares, always keeping in mind that by a square
we mean a boundary together with the points interior to it. If a particular square
contains points that are not in R, we remove those points and call what remains a
partial square. We thus cover the region R with a finite number of squares and partial
squares (Fig. 55), and our proof of the following lemma starts with this covering.
Lemma. Let f be analytic throughout a closed region R consisting of the
points interior to a positively oriented simple closed contour C together with the
points on C itself. For any positive number ε, the region R can be covered with a
finite number of squares and partial squares, indexed by j = 1, 2, . . . , n, such that
in each one there is a fixed point zj for which the inequality

is satisfied by all points other than zj in that square or partial square.

Proof of the Theorem

153

To start the proof, we consider the possibility that in the covering constructed
just prior to the statement of the lemma, there is some square or partial square in
which no point zj exists such that inequality (1) holds for all other points z in it.
If that subregion is a square, we construct four smaller squares by drawing line
segments joining the midpoints of its opposite sides (Fig. 55). If the subregion is
a partial square, we treat the whole square in the same manner and then let the
portions that lie outside of R be discarded. If in any one of these smaller subregions, no point zj exists such that inequality (1) holds for all other points z in it, we
construct still smaller squares and partial squares, etc. When this is done to each of
the original subregions that requires it, we find that after a finite number of steps,
the region R can be covered with a finite number of squares and partial squares
such that the lemma is true.
To verify this, we suppose that the needed points zj do not exist after subdividing one of the original subregions a finite number of times and reach a contradiction.
We let σ0 denote that subregion if it is a square; if it is a partial square, we let σ0
denote the entire square of which it is a part. After we subdivide σ0 , at least one of
the four smaller squares, denoted by σ1 , must contain points of R but no appropriate
point zj . We then subdivide σ1 and continue in this manner. It may be that after a
square σk−1 (k = 1, 2, . . .) has been subdivided, more than one of the four smaller
squares constructed from it can be chosen. To make a specific choice, we take σk
to be the one lowest and then furthest to the left.
In view of the manner in which the nested infinite sequence
(2)

σ0 , σ1 , σ2 , . . . , σk−1 , σk , . . .

of squares is constructed, it is easily shown (Exercise 9, Sec. 49) that there is a point
z0 common to each σk ; also, each of these squares contains points of R other than
possibly z0 . Recall how the sizes of the squares in the sequence are decreasing, and
note that any δ neighborhood |z − z0 | < δ of z0 contains such squares when their
diagonals have lengths less than δ. Every δ neighborhood |z − z0 | < δ therefore contains points of R distinct from z0 , and this means that z0 is an accumulation point of
R. Since the region R is a closed set, it follows that z0 is a point in R. (See Sec. 11.)
Now the function f is analytic throughout R and, in particular, at z0 . Consequently, f  (z0 ) exists, According to the definition of derivative (Sec. 19), there is,
for each positive number ε, a δ neighborhood |z − z0 | < δ such that the inequality


 f (z) − f (z0 )



− f (z0 ) < ε

z − z0
is satisfied by all points distinct from z0 in that neighborhood. But the neighborhood
|z − z0 | < δ contains a square σK when the integer K is large enough that the length
of a diagonal of that square is less than δ (Fig. 56). Consequently, z0 serves as the
point zj in inequality (1) for the subregion consisting of the square σK or a part
of σK . Contrary to the way in which the sequence (2) was formed, then, it is not
necessary to subdivide σK . We thus arrive at a contradiction, and the proof of the
lemma is complete.

Continuing with a function f which is analytic throughout a region R consisting

now ready to prove the Cauchy–Goursat theorem, namely that

(3)
f (z) dz = 0.
C

Given an arbitrary positive number ε, we consider the covering of R in the
statement of the lemma. We then define on the j th square or partial square a function
δj (z) whose values are δj (zj ) = 0, where zj is the fixed point in inequality (1), and
δj (z) =

(4)

f (z) − f (zj )
− f  (zj )

when z = zj .

According to inequality (1),
|δj (z)| < ε

(5)

at all points z in the subregion on which δj (z) is defined. Also, the function δj (z)
is continuous throughout the subregion since f (z) is continuous there and
lim δj (z) = f  (zj ) − f  (zj ) = 0.

z→zj

Next, we let Cj (j = 1, 2, . . . , n) denote the positively oriented boundaries of
the above squares or partial squares covering R. In view of our definition of δj (z),
the value of f at a point z on any particular Cj can be written
f (z) = f (zj ) − zj f  (zj ) + f  (zj )z + (z − zj )δj (z);
and this means that

entirely or partially with the boundary of a square. In either case, we let sj denote
the length of a side of the square. Since, in the j th integral, both the variable z and
the point zj lie in that square,
√
|z − zj | ≤ 2sj .
In view of inequality (5), then, we know that each integrand on the right in inequality
(8) satisfies the condition
√
(9)
|(z − zj )δj (z)| = |z − zj | |δj (z)| < 2sj ε.
As for the length of the path Cj , it is 4sj if Cj is the boundary of a square. In that

If Cj is the boundary of a partial square, its length does not exceed 4sj + Lj , where

as well as all of the squares originally used in covering R (Fig. 57). Note that the

Since the value of the positive number ε is arbitrary, we can choose it so that
the right-hand side of this last inequality is as small as we please. The left-hand
side, which is independent of ε, must therefore be equal to zero ; and statement (3)
follows. This completes the proof of the Cauchy–Goursat theorem.

48. SIMPLY CONNECTED DOMAINS
A simply connected domain D is a domain such that every simple closed contour
within it encloses only points of D. The set of points interior to a simple closed
contour is an example. The annular domain between two concentric circles is, however, not simply connected. Domains that are not simply connected are discussed
in the next section.
The closed contour in the Cauchy–Goursat theorem (Sec. 46) need not be
simple when the theorem is adapted to simply connected domains. More precisely,

for every closed contour C lying in D.
The proof is easy if C is a simple closed contour or if it is a closed contour that
intersects itself a finite number of times. For if C is simple and lies in D, the function
f is analytic at each point interior to and on C; and the Cauchy–Goursat theorem
ensures that equation (1) holds. Furthermore, if C is closed but intersects itself a
finite number of times, it consists of a finite number of simple closed contours.
This is illustrated in Fig. 58, where the simple closed contours Ck (k = 1, 2, 3, 4)
make up C. Since the value of the integral around each Ck is zero, according to the
Cauchy–Goursat theorem, it follows that

Corollary. A function f that is analytic throughout a simply connected domain
D must have an antiderivative everywhere in D.
We begin the proof of this corollary with the observation that a function f is
continuous on a domain D when it is analytic there. Consequently, since equation
(1) holds for the function in the hypothesis of this corollary and for each closed
contour C in D, f has an antiderivative throughout D, according to the theorem in
Sec. 44. Note that since the finite plane is simply connected, the corollary tells us
that entire functions always possess antiderivatives.

49. MULTIPLY CONNECTED DOMAINS
A domain that is not simply connected (Sec. 48) is said to be multiply connected.
The following theorem is an adaptation of the Cauchy–Goursat theorem to multiply
connected domains.
Theorem.

Suppose that

(a) C is a simple closed contour, described in the counterclockwise direction;
(b) Ck (k = 1, 2, . . . , n) are simple closed contours interior to C, all described in
the clockwise direction, that are disjoint and whose interiors have no points in
common (Fig. 60).
If a function f is analytic on all of these contours and throughout the multiply
connected domain consisting of the points inside C and exterior to each Ck , then

Note that in equation (1), the direction of each path of integration is such that
the multiply connected domain lies to the left of that path.
To prove the theorem, we introduce a polygonal path L1 , consisting of a finite
number of line segments joined end to end, to connect the outer contour C to the
inner contour C1 . We introduce another polygonal path L2 which connects C1 to
C2 ; and we continue in this manner, with Ln+1 connecting Cn to C. As indicated
by the single-barbed arrows in Fig. 60, two simple closed contours 1 and 2 can
be formed, each consisting of polygonal paths Lk or −Lk and pieces of C and Ck
and each described in such a direction that the points enclosed by them lie to the
left. The Cauchy–Goursat theorem can now be applied to f on 1 and 2 , and the
sum of the values of the integrals over those contours is found to be zero. Since the
integrals in opposite directions along each path Lk cancel, only the integrals along
C and the Ck remain; and we arrive at statement (1).
Corollary. Let C1 and C2 denote positively oriented simple closed contours,
where C1 is interior to C2 (Fig. 61). If a function f is analytic in the closed region

one of the two halves of a1 ≤ x ≤ b1 , etc. Prove that there is a point x0 which belongs
to every one of the closed intervals an ≤ x ≤ bn .

is divided into four equal squares one of which, called σ2 , is selected, etc. (see Sec.

50. CAUCHY INTEGRAL FORMULA
Another fundamental result will now be established.
Theorem. Let f be analytic everywhere inside and on a simple closed contour
C, taken in the positive sense. If z0 is any point interior to C, then

f (z) dz

f (z0 ) =
(1)
.
2πi C z − z0
Formula (1) is called the Cauchy integral formula. It tells us that if a function
f is to be analytic within and on a simple closed contour C, then the values of f
interior to C are completely determined by the values of f on C.
When the Cauchy integral formula is written as

f (z) dz
(2)
= 2πif (z0 ),
C z − z0
it can be used to evaluate certain integrals along simple closed contours.
EXAMPLE. Let C be the positively oriented circle |z| = 2. Since the function
f (z) =

z
9 − z2

is analytic within and on C and since the point z0 = −i is interior to C, formula
(2) tells us that

We begin the proof of the theorem by letting Cρ denote a positively oriented
circle |z − z0 | = ρ, where ρ is small enough that Cρ is interior to C (see Fig. 66).
Since the quotient f (z)/(z − z0 ) is analytic between and on the contours Cρ and
C, it follows from the principle of deformation of paths (Sec. 49) that

Now the fact that f is analytic, and therefore continuous, at z0 ensures that
corresponding to each positive number ε, however small, there is a positive number
δ such that
(5)

|f (z) − f (z0 )| < ε

whenever |z − z0 | < δ.

Let the radius ρ of the circle Cρ be smaller than the number δ in the second of
these inequalities. Since |z − z0 | = ρ < δ when z is on Cρ , it follows that the first
of inequalities (5) holds when z is such a point; and the theorem in Sec. 43, giving
upper bounds for the moduli of contour integrals, tells us that

Since the left-hand side of this inequality is a nonnegative constant that is less than
an arbitrarily small positive number, it must be equal to zero. Hence equation (2)
is valid, and the theorem is proved.

51. AN EXTENSION OF THE CAUCHY INTEGRAL

The Cauchy integral formula in the theorem in Sec. 50 can be extended so as to
provide an integral representation for derivatives of f at z0 . To obtain the extension,
we consider a function f that is analytic everywhere inside and on a simple closed

52. SOME CONSEQUENCES OF THE EXTENSION
We turn now to some important consequences of the extension of the Cauchy integral
formula in the previous section.
Theorem 1. If a function f is analytic at a given point, then its derivatives
of all orders are analytic there too.
To prove this remarkable theorem, we assume that a function f is analytic
at a point z0 . There must, then, be a neighborhood |z − z0 | < ε of z0 throughout
which f is analytic (see Sec. 24). Consequently, there is a positively oriented circle
C0 , centered at z0 and with radius ε/2, such that f is analytic inside and on C0
(Fig. 68). From expression (4), Sec. 51, we know that

Some Consequences of The Extension

169

at each point z interior to C0 , and the existence of f  (z) throughout the neighborhood |z − z0 | < ε/2 means that f  is analytic at z0 . One can apply the same
argument to the analytic function f  to conclude that its derivative f  is analytic,
etc. Theorem 1 is now established.
As a consequence, when a function
f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)
is analytic at a point z = (x, y), the differentiability of f  ensures the continuity of
f  there (Sec. 19). Then, since (Sec. 21)
f  (z) = ux + ivx = vy − iuy ,
we may conclude that the first-order partial derivatives of u and v are continuous
at that point. Furthermore, since f  is analytic and continuous at z and since
f  (z) = uxx + ivxx = vyx − iuyx ,
etc., we arrive at a corollary that was anticipated in Sec. 26, where harmonic functions were introduced.
Corollary. If a function f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is analytic at a point
z = (x, y), then the component functions u and v have continuous partial derivatives
of all orders at that point.
The proof of the next theorem, due to E. Morera (1856–1909), depends on
the fact that the derivative of an analytic function is itself analytic, as stated in
Theorem 1.
Theorem 2.
(1)

Let f be continuous on a domain D. If

f (z) dz = 0
C

for every closed contour C in D, then f is analytic throughout D.
In particular, when D is simply connected, we have for the class of continuous functions defined on D the converse of the theorem in Sec. 48, which is the
adaptation of the Cauchy–Goursat theorem to such domains.
To prove the theorem here, we observe that when its hypothesis is satisfied, the
theorem in Sec. 44 ensures that f has an antiderivative in D ; that is, there exists
an analytic function F such that F  (z) = f (z) at each point in D. Since f is the
derivative of F , it then follows from Theorem 1 that f is analytic in D.
Our final theorem here will be essential in the next section.

53. LIOUVILLE’S THEOREM AND THE FUNDAMENTAL
THEOREM OF ALGEBRA
Cauchy’s inequality in Theorem 3 of Sec. 52 can be used to show that no entire
function except a constant is bounded in the complex plane. Our first theorem here,

sec. 53

Liouville’s Theorem and The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

173

which is known as Liouville’s theorem, states this result in a somewhat different
way.
Theorem 1. If a function f is entire and bounded in the complex plane, then
f (z) is constant througout the plane.
To start the proof, we assume that f is as stated and note that since f is entire,
Theorem 3 in Sec. 52 can be applied with any choice of z0 and R. In particular,
Cauchy’s inequality (2) in that theorem tells us that when n = 1,
MR
.
R
Moreover, the boundedness condition on f tells us that a nonnegative constant M
exists such that |f (z)| ≤ M for all z ; and, because the constant MR in inequality
(1) is always less than or equal to M, it follows that
 

f (z0 ) ≤ M ,
(2)
R
where R can be arbitrarily large. Now the number M in inequality (2) is independent
of the value of R that is taken. Hence that inequality holds for arbitrarily large
values of R only if f  (z0 ) = 0. Since the choice of z0 was arbitrary, this means that
f  (z) = 0 everywhere in the complex plane. Consequently, f is a constant function,
according to the theorem in Sec. 24.
The following theorem, called the fundamental theorem of algebra, follows
readily from Liouville’s theorem.
|f  (z0 )| ≤

(1)

Theorem 2.

Any polynomial

P (z) = a0 + a1 z + a2 z2 + · · · + an zn

(an = 0)

of degree n (n ≥ 1) has at least one zero. That is, there exists at least one point z0
such that P (z0 ) = 0.
The proof here is by contradiction. Suppose that P (z) is not zero for any value
of z. Then the reciprocal
1
f (z) =
P (z)
is clearly entire, and it is also bounded in the complex plane.
To show that its is bounded, we first write

Integrals

chap. 4

Next, we observe that a sufficiently large positive number R can be found such
that the modulus of each of the quotients in expression (3) is less than the number
|an |/(2n) when |z| > R. The generalized triangle inequality (10), Sec. 4, which
applies to n complex numbers, thus shows that
|w| <

|an |
2

whenever |z| > R.

Consequently,
|an + w| ≥ ||an | − |w|| >

|an |
2

whenever |z| > R.

This inequality and expression (4) enable us to write
(5)

|Pn (z)| = |an + w||z|n >

|an | n
|an | n
|z| >
R
2
2

whenever |z| > R.

Evidently, then,
|f (z)| =

2
1
<
|P (z)|
|an |R n

whenever |z| > R.

So f is bounded in the region exterior to the disk |z| ≤ R. But f is continuous in
that closed disk, and this means that f is bounded there too (Sec. 18). Hence f is
bounded in the entire plane.
It now follows from Liouville’s theorem that f (z), and consequently P (z), is
constant. But P (z) is not constant, and we have reached a contradiction.∗
The fundamental theorem tells us that any polynomial P (z) of degree n (n ≥ 1)
can be expressed as a product of linear factors:
(6)

P (z) = c(z − z1 )(z − z2 ) · · · (z − zn ),

where c and zk (k = 1, 2, . . . , n) are complex constants. More precisely, the theorem
ensures that P (z) has a zero z1 . Then, according to Exercise 9, Sec. 54,
P (z) = (z − z1 )Q1 (z),
where Q1 (z) is a polynomial of degree n − 1. The same argument, applied to Q1 (z),
reveals that there is a number z2 such that
P (z) = (z − z1 )(z − z2 )Q2 (z),
where Q2 (z) is a polynomial of degree n − 2. Continuing in this way, we arrive at
expression (6). Some of the constants zk in expression (6) may, of course, appear
more than once, and it is clear that P (z) can have no more than n distinct zeros.

Maximum Modulus Principle

54. MAXIMUM MODULUS PRINCIPLE
In this section, we derive an important result involving maximum values of the
moduli of analytic functions. We begin with a needed lemma.
Lemma. Suppose that |f (z)| ≤ |f (z0 )| at each point z in some neighborhood
|z − z0 | < ε in which f is analytic. Then f (z) has the constant value f (z0 ) throughout that neighborhood.
To prove this, we assume that f satisfies the stated conditions and let z1 be any
point other than z0 in the given neighborhood. We then let ρ be the distance between
z1 and z0 . If Cρ denotes the positively oriented circle |z − z0 | = ρ, centered at z0
and passing through z1 (Fig. 70), the Cauchy integral formula tells us that

f (z0 ) =

and the parametric representation

for Cρ enables us to write equation (1) as
 2π

(2)
f (z0 + ρeiθ ) dθ.
f (z0 ) =

We note from expression (2) that when a function is analytic within and on a given
circle, its value at the center is the arithmetic mean of its values on the circle. This
result is called Gauss’s mean value theorem.

On the other hand, since

(0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π),

we find that

Thus

It is now evident from inequalities (3) and (5) that

|f (z0 + ρeiθ )| dθ,
2π 0
or

 2π

[|f (z0 )| − |f (z0 + ρeiθ )|] dθ = 0.

0

The integrand in this last integral is continuous in the variable θ ; and, in view of
condition (4), it is greater than or equal to zero on the entire interval 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π.
Because the value of the integral is zero, then, the integrand must be identically
equal to zero. That is,
(6)

|f (z0 + ρeiθ )| = |f (z0 )|

(0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π).

This shows that |f (z)| = |f (z0 )| for all points z on the circle |z − z0 | = ρ.
Finally, since z1 is any point in the deleted neighborhood 0 < |z − z0 | < ε, we
see that the equation |f (z)| = |f (z0 )| is, in fact, satisfied by all points z lying on any
circle |z − z0 | = ρ, where 0 < ρ < ε. Consequently, |f (z)| = |f (z0 )| everywhere
in the neighborhood |z − z0 | < ε. But we know from Example 4. Sec. 25, that when
the modulus of an analytic function is constant in a domain, the function itself is
constant there. Thus f (z) = f (z0 ) for each point z in the neighborhood, and the
proof of the lemma is complete.
This lemma can be used to prove the following theorem, which is known as
the maximum modulus principle.
Theorem. If a function f is analytic and not constant in a given domain D,
then |f (z)| has no maximum value in D. That is, there is no point z0 in the domain
such that |f (z)| ≤ |f (z0 )| for all points z in it.
Given that f is analytic in D, we shall prove the theorem by assuming that
|f (z)| does have a maximum value at some point z0 in D and then showing that
f (z) must be constant throughout D.
The general approach here is similar to that taken in the proof of the lemma
in Sec. 27. We draw a polygonal line L lying in D and extending from z0 to any
other point P in D. Also, d represents the shortest distance from points on L to the

sec. 54

Maximum Modulus Principle

177

boundary of D. When D is the entire plane, d may have any positive value. Next,
we observe that there is a finite sequence of points
z0 , z1 , z2 , . . . , zn−1 , zn
along L such that zn coincides with the point P and
|zk − zk−1 | < d

(k = 1, 2, . . . , n).

In forming a finite sequence of neighborhoods (Fig. 71)
N0 , N1 , N2 , . . . , Nn−1 , Nn
where each Nk has center zk and radius d, we see that f is analytic in each of
these neighborhoods, which are all contained in D, and that the center of each
neighborhood Nk (k = 1, 2, . . . , n) lies in the neighborhood Nk−1 .

Since |f (z)| was assumed to have a maximum value in D at z0 , it also has
a maximum value in N0 at that point. Hence, according to the preceding lemma,
f (z) has the constant value f (z0 ) throughout N0 . In particular, f (z1 ) = f (z0 ). This
means that |f (z)| ≤ |f (z1 )| for each point z in N1 ; and the lemma can be applied
again, this time telling us that
f (z) = f (z1 ) = f (z0 )
when z is in N1 . Since z2 is in N1 , then, f (z2 ) = f (z0 ). Hence |f (z)| ≤ |f (z2 )|
when z is in N2 ; and the lemma is once again applicable, showing that
f (z) = f (z2 ) = f (z0 )
when z is in N2 . Continuing in this manner, we eventually reach the neighborhood
Nn and arrive at the fact that f (zn ) = f (z0 ).
Recalling that zn coincides with the point P , which is any point other than z0
in D, we may conclude that f (z) = f (z0 ) for every point z in D. Inasmuch as f (z)
has now been shown to be constant throughout D, the theorem is proved.
If a function f that is analytic at each point in the interior of a closed bounded
region R is also continuous throughout R, then the modulus |f (z)| has a maximum
value somewhere in R (Sec. 18). That is, there exists a nonnegative constant M such
that |f (z)| ≤ M for all points z in R, and equality holds for at least one such point.

178

Integrals

chap. 4

If f is a constant function, then |f (z)| = M for all z in R. If, however, f (z) is not
constant, then, according to the theorem just proved, |f (z)| = M for any point z in
the interior of R. We thus arrive at an important corollary.
Corollary. Suppose that a function f is continuous on a closed bounded region
R and that it is analytic and not constant in the interior of R. Then the maximum
value of |f (z)| in R, which is always reached, occurs somewhere on the boundary
of R and never in the interior.
EXAMPLE. Let R denote the rectangular region 0 ≤ x ≤ π, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1. The
corollary tells us that the modulus of the entire function f (z) = sin z has a maximum
value in R that occurs somewhere on the boundary of R and not in its interior. This
can be verified directly by writing (see Sec. 34)

|f (z)| = sin2 x + sinh2 y
and noting that the term sin2 x is greatest when x = π/2 and that the increasing
function sinh2 y is greatest when y = 1. Thus the maximum value of |f (z)| in R
occurs at the boundary point z = (π/2, 1) and at no other point in R (Fig. 72).

FIGURE 72

When the function f in the corollary is written f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y), the
component function u(x, y) also has a maximum value in R which is assumed on
the boundary of R and never in the interior, where it is harmonic (Sec. 26). This is
because the composite function g(z) = exp[f (z)] is continuous in R and analytic
and not constant in the interior. Hence its modulus |g(z)| = exp[u(x, y)], which is
continuous in R, must assume its maximum value in R on the boundary. In view
of the increasing nature of the exponential function, it follows that the maximum
value of u(x, y) also occurs on the boundary.
Properties of minimum values of |f (z)| and u(x, y) are treated in the exercises.

EXERCISES
1. Suppose that f (z) is entire and that the harmonic function u(x, y) = Re[f (z)] has an
upper bound u0 ; that is, u(x, y) ≤ u0 for all points (x, y) in the xy plane. Show that
u(x, y) must be constant throughout the plane.
Suggestion: Apply Liouville’s theorem (Sec. 53) to the function g(z) = exp[f (z)].

2. Show that for R sufficiently large, the polynomial P (z) in Theorem 2, Sec. 53, satisfies
the inequality
|P (z)| < 2|an ||z|n whenever |z| ≥ R.
[Compare with the first of inequalities (5), Sec. 53.]
Suggestion: Observe that there is a positive number R such that the modulus of
each quotient in expression (3), Sec. 53, is less than |an |/n when |z| > R.
3. Let a function f be continuous on a closed bounded region R, and let it be analytic
and not constant throughout the interior of R. Assuming that f (z) = 0 anywhere in
R, prove that |f (z)| has a minimum value m in R which occurs on the boundary of R
and never in the interior. Do this by applying the corresponding result for maximum
values (Sec. 54) to the function g(z) = 1/f (z).
4. Use the function f (z) = z to show that in Exercise 3 the condition f (z) = 0 anywhere
in R is necessary in order to obtain the result of that exercise. That is, show that
|f (z)| can reach its minimum value at an interior point when the minimum value is
zero.
5. Consider the function f (z) = (z + 1)2 and the closed triangular region R with vertices
at the points z = 0, z = 2, and z = i. Find points in R where |f (z)| has its maximum
and minimum values, thus illustrating results in Sec. 54 and Exercise 3.
Suggestion: Interpret |f (z)| as the square of the distance between z and −1.
Ans. z = 2, z = 0.
6. Let f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) be a function that is continuous on a closed bounded
region R and analytic and not constant throughout the interior of R. Prove that the
component function u(x, y) has a minimum value in R which occurs on the boundary
of R and never in the interior. (See Exercise 3.)
7. Let f be the function f (z) = ez and R the rectangular region 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ π .
Illustrate results in Sec. 54 and Exercise 6 by finding points in R where the component
function u(x, y) = Re[f (z)] reaches its maximum and minimum values.
Ans. z = 1, z = 1 + π i.
8. Let the function f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) be continuous on a closed bounded
region R, and suppose that it is analytic and not constant in the interior of R.
Show that the component function v(x, y) has maximum and minimum values in
R which are reached on the boundary of R and never in the interior, where it is
harmonic.
Suggestion: Apply results in Sec. 54 and Exercise 6 to the function g(z) = −if (z).
9. Let z0 be a zero of the polynomial
P (z) = a0 + a1 z + a2 z2 + · · · + an zn
of degree n (n ≥ 1). Show in the following way that
P (z) = (z − z0 )Q(z)
where Q(z) is a polynomial of degree n − 1.

This chapter is devoted mainly to series representations of analytic functions. We
present theorems that guarantee the existence of such representations, and we
develop some facility in manipulating series.

positive integer n0 such that
|zn − z| < ε

whenever n > n0 .

Geometrically, this means that for sufficiently large values of n, the points zn lie in
any given ε neighborhood of z (Fig. 73). Since we can choose ε as small as we please,

it follows that the points zn become arbitrarily close to z as their subscripts
increase. Note that the value of n0 that is needed will, in general, depend on the
value of ε.
The sequence (1) can have at most one limit. That is, a limit z is unique if it
exists (Exercise 5, Sec. 56). When that limit exists, the sequence is said to converge
to z ; and we write
lim zn = z.

If the sequence has no limit, it diverges.

To prove this theorem, we first assume that conditions (5) hold and obtain
condition (4) from it. According to conditions (5), there exist, for each positive
number ε, positive integers n1 and n2 such that
ε
whenever n > n1
|xn − x| <

and
|yn − y| <

Hence if n0 is the larger of the two integers n1 and n2 ,

Since
|(xn + iyn ) − (x + iy)| = |(xn − x) + i(yn − y)| ≤ |xn − x| + |yn − y|,
then,
|zn − z| <

whenever n > n0 .

Condition (4) thus holds.
Conversely, if we start with condition (4), we know that for each positive
number ε, there exists a positive integer n0 such that
|(xn + iyn ) − (x + iy)| < ε

whenever n > n0 .

But
|xn − x| ≤ |(xn − x) + i(yn − y)| = |(xn + iyn ) − (x + iy)|
and
|yn − y| ≤ |(xn − x) + i(yn − y)| = |(xn + iyn ) − (x + iy)|;
and this means that
|xn − x| < ε

and |yn − y| < ε

whenever n > n0 .

That is, conditions (5) are satisfied.
Note how the theorem enables us to write

Limits (7) therefore imply statement (3), and conversely. Since XN and YN are the
partial sums of the series (4), the theorem here is proved.
This theorem can be useful in showing that a number of familiar properties
of series in calculus carry over to series whose terms are complex numbers. To
illustrate how this is done, we include here two such properties and present them
as corollaries.
Corollary 1. If a series of complex numbers converges, the nth term converges
to zero as n tends to infinity.
Assuming that series (1) converges, we know from the theorem that if
zn = xn + iyn

(n = 1, 2, . . .),

then each of the series

converges. We know, moreover, from calculus that the nth term of a convergent
series of real numbers approaches zero as n tends to infinity. Thus, by the theorem
in Sec. 55,
lim zn = lim xn + i lim yn = 0 + 0 · i = 0 ;

n→∞

n→∞

n→∞

and the proof of Corollary 1 is complete.
It follows from this corollary that the terms of convergent series are bounded.
That is, when series (1) converges, there exists a positive constant M such that
|zn | ≤ M for each positive integer n. (See Exercise 9.)
For another important property of series of complex numbers that follows from
a corresponding property in calculus, series (1) is said to be absolutely convergent
if the series
∞

n=1

|zn | =


xn2 + yn2

n=1


of real numbers xn2 + yn2 converges.
Corollary 2. The absolute convergence of a series of complex numbers implies
the convergence of that series.
To prove Corollary 2, we assume that series (1) converges absolutely. Since


|xn | ≤ xn2 + yn2 and |yn | ≤ xn2 + yn2 ,
we know from the comparison test in calculus that the two series
∞


|xn |

and

∞


|yn |

must converge. Moreover, since the absolute convergence of a series of real numbers implies the convergence of the series itself, it follows that the series (8) both
converge. In view of the theorem in this section, then, series (1) converges. This
finishes the proof of Corollary 2.
In establishing the fact that the sum of a series is a given number S, it is often
convenient to define the remainder ρN after N terms, using the partial sums (2) :
(9)

ρN = S − SN .

Thus S = SN + ρN ; and, since |SN − S| = |ρN − 0|, we see that a series converges
to a number S if and only if the sequence of remainders tends to zero. We shall

make considerable use of this observation in our treatment of power series. They
are series of the form

stated region containing z0 . In such series, involving a variable z, we shall denote

Any function which is analytic at a point z0 must have a Taylor series about z0 .
For, if f is analytic at z0 , it is analytic throughout some neighborhood |z − z0 | < ε
of that point (Sec. 24) ; and ε may serve as the value of R0 in the statement of
Taylor’s theorem. Also, if f is entire, R0 can be chosen arbitrarily large ; and the
condition of validity becomes |z − z0 | < ∞. The series then converges to f (z) at
each point z in the finite plane.
When it is known that f is analytic everywhere inside a circle centered at
z0 , convergence of its Taylor series about z0 to f (z) for each point z within that
circle is ensured; no test for the convergence of the series is even required. In fact,
according to Taylor’s theorem, the series converges to f (z) within the circle about
z0 whose radius is the distance from z0 to the nearest point z1 at which f fails to
be analytic. In Sec. 65, we shall find that this is actually the largest circle centered
at z0 such that the series converges to f (z) for all z interior to it.
In the following section, we shall first prove Taylor’s theorem when z0 = 0, in
which case f is assumed to be analytic throughout a disk |z| < R0 and series (1)
becomes a Maclaurin series:
f (z) =

The proof when z0 is arbitrary will follow as an immediate consequence. A reader

in Sec. 59.

58. PROOF OF TAYLOR’S THEOREM
To begin the derivation of representation (4), Sec. 57, we write |z| = r and let
C0 denote and positively oriented circle |z| = r0 , where r < r0 < R0 (see Fig. 75).
Since f is analytic inside and on the circle C0 and since the point z is interior to

To accomplish this, we recall that |z| = r and that C0 has radius r0 , where r0 > r.
Then, if s is a point on C0 , we can see that
|s − z| ≥ ||s| − |z|| = r0 − r.

Inasmuch as (r/r0 ) < 1, limit (7) clearly holds.
To verify the theorem when the disk of radius R0 is centered at an arbitrary point
z0 , we suppose that f is analytic when |z − z0 | < R0 and note that the composite
function f (z + z0 ) must be analytic when |(z + z0 ) − z0 | < R0 . This last inequality
is, of course, just |z| < R0 ; and, if we write g(z) = f (z + z0 ), the analyticity of g
in the disk |z| < R0 ensures the existence of a Maclaurin series representation:
g(z) =

for all points z interior to some circle centered at z0 , then the power series here must
be the Taylor series for f about z0 , regardless of how those constants arise. This
observation often allows us to find the coefficients an in Taylor series in more efficient
ways than by appealing directly to the formula an = f (n) (z0 )/n! in Taylor’s theorem.
In the following examples, we use the formula in Taylor’s theorem to find
the Maclaurin series expansions of some fairly simple functions, and we emphasize
the use of those expansions in finding other representations. In our examples, we
shall freely use expected properties of convergent series, such as those verified in
Exercises 7 and 8, Sec. 56.
EXAMPLE 1. Since the function f (z) = ez is entire, it has a Maclaurin
series representation which is valid for all z. Here f (n) (z) = ez (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .) ;

60. LAURENT SERIES
If a function f fails to be analytic at a point z0 , one cannot apply Taylor’s theorem
at that point. It is often possible, however, to find a series representation for f (z)
involving both positive and negative powers of z − z0 . (See Example 5, Sec. 59,
and also Exercises 11, 12, and 13 for that section.) We now present the theory of
such representations, and we begin with Laurent’s theorem.
Theorem. Suppose that a function f is analytic throughout an annular domain
R1 < |z − z0 | < R2 , centered at z0 , and let C denote any positively oriented simple
closed contour around z0 and lying in that domain (Fig. 76). Then, at each point in
the domain, f (z) has the series representation

In either one of the forms (1) and (4), the representation of f (z) is called a Laurent
series.
Observe that the integrand in expression (3) can be written f (z)(z − z0 )n−1 .
Thus it is clear that when f is actually analytic throughout the disk |z − z0 | < R2 , this
integrand is too. Hence all of the coefficients bn are zero; and, because (Sec. 51)

expansion (1) reduces to a Taylor series about z0 .
If, however, f fails to be analytic at z0 but is otherwise analytic in the disk
|z − z0 | < R2 , the radius R1 can be chosen arbitrarily small. Representation (1) is
then valid in the punctured disk 0 < |z − z0 | < R2 . Similarly, if f is analytic at each
point in the finite plane exterior to the circle |z − z0 | = R1 , the condition of validity
is R1 < |z − z0 | < ∞. Note that if f is analytic everywhere in the finite plane except
at z0 , series (1) is valid at each point of analyticity, or when 0 < |z − z0 | < ∞.
We shall prove Laurent’s theorem first when z0 = 0, which means that the
annulus is centered at the origin. The verification of the theorem when z0 is arbitrary
will follow readily; and, as was the case with Taylor’s theorem, a reader can skip
the entire proof without difficulty.

61. PROOF OF LAURENT’S THEOREM
We start the proof by forming a closed annular region r1 ≤ |z| ≤ r2 that is contained
in the domain R1 < |z| < R2 and whose interior contains both the point z and the
contour C (Fig. 77). We let C1 and C2 denote the circles |z| = r1 and |z| = r2 ,

respectively, and we assign them a positive orientation. Observe that f is analytic
on C1 and C2 , as well as in the annular domain between them.
Next, we construct a positively oriented circle γ with center at z and small
enough to be contained in the interior of the annular region r1 ≤ |z| ≤ r2 , as shown
in Fig. 77. It then follows from the adaptation of the Cauchy–Goursat theorem to
integrals of analytic functions around oriented boundaries of multiply connected
domains (Sec. 49) that

(6)

lim ρN (z) = 0 and

N →∞

lim σN (z) = 0.

N →∞

These limits are readily established by a method already used in the proof of Taylor’s
theorem in Sec. 58. We write |z| = r, so that r1 < r < r2 , and let M denote the
maximum value of |f (s)| on C1 and C2 . We also note that if s is a point on C2 ,
then |s − z| ≥ r2 − r ; and if s is on C1 , we have |z − s| ≥ r − r1 . This enables us
to write
 N
r
Mr2
Mr1 r1 N
|ρN (z)| ≤
and |σN (z)| ≤
.
r2 − r r2
r − r1 r
Since (r/r2 ) < 1 and (r1 /r) < 1, it is now clear that both ρN (z) and σN (z) tend to
zero as N tends to infinity.
Finally, we need only recall the corollary in Sec. 49 to see that the contours
used in integrals (5) here may be replaced by the contour C. This completes the
proof of Laurent’s theorem when z0 = 0 since, if z is used instead of s as the
variable of integration, expressions (5) for the coefficients an and bn are the same
as expressions (2) and (3) in Sec. 60 when z0 = 0 there.
To extend the proof to the general case in which z0 is an arbitrary point in the
finite plane, we let f be a function satisfying the conditions in the theorem; and, just
as we did in the proof of Taylor’s theorem, we write g(z) = f (z + z0 ). Since f (z) is
analytic in the annulus R1 < |z − z0 | < R2 , the function f (z + z0 ) is analytic when
R1 < |(z + z0 ) − z0 | < R2 . That is, g is analytic in the annulus R1 < |z| < R2 ,
which is centered at the origin. Now the simple closed contour C in the statement
of the theorem has some parametric representation z = z(t) (a ≤ t ≤ b), where
(7)

R1 < |z(t) − z0 | < R2

for all t in the interval a ≤ t ≤ b. Hence if  denotes the path
(8)

z = z(t) − z0

(a ≤ t ≤ b),

 is not only a simple closed contour but, in view of inequalities (7), it lies in the

the condition of validity R1 < |z| < R2 . Expression (10) for the coefficients an is,

The coefficients in a Laurent series are generally found by means other than appealing directly to their integral representations. This is illustrated in the following
examples, where it is always assumed that when the annular domain is specified, a
Laurent series for a given function in unique. As was the case with Taylor series,
we defer the proof of such uniqueness until Sec. 66.

63. ABSOLUTE AND UNIFORM CONVERGENCE
OF POWER SERIES
This section and the three following it are devoted mainly to various properties of
power series. A reader who wishes to simply accept the theorems and the corollary
in these sections can easily skip the proofs in order to reach Sec. 67 more quickly.
We recall from Sec. 56 that a series of complex numbers converges absolutely
if the series of absolute values of those numbers converges. The following theorem
concerns the absolute convergence of power series.
Theorem 1.

If a power series
∞


(1)

an (z − z0 )n

n=0

converges when z = z1 (z1 = z0 ), then it is absolutely convergent at each point z in
the open disk |z − z0 | < R1 where R1 = |z1 − z0 | (Fig. 79).

Absolute and Uniform Convergence of Power Series

209

We start the proof by assuming that the series
∞


an (z1 − z0 )n

(z1 = z0 )

n=0

converges. The terms an (z1 − z0 )n are thus bounded ; that is,
|an (z1 − z0 )n | ≤ M

(n = 0, 1, 2, . . .)

for some positive constant M (see Sec. 56). If |z − z0 | < R1 and if we write
ρ=

|z − z0 |
,
|z1 − z0 |



n

we can see that
|an (z − z0 )n | = |an (z1 − z0 )n |

|z − z0 |
|z1 − z0 |

≤ Mρ n

(n = 0, 1, 2, . . .).

Now the series
∞


Mρ n

n=0

is a geometric series, which converges since ρ < 1. Hence, by the comparison test
for series of real numbers,
∞


|an (z − z0 )n |

n=0

converges in the open disk |z − z0 | < R1 . This completes the proof.
The theorem tells us that the set of all points inside some circle centered at z0
is a region of convergence for the power series (1), provided it converges at some
point other than z0 . The greatest circle centered at z0 such that series (1) converges
at each point inside is called the circle of convergence of series (1). The series
cannot converge at any point z2 outside that circle, according to the theorem ; for
if it did, it would converge everywhere inside the circle centered at z0 and passing
through z2 . The first circle could not, then, be the circle of convergence.
Our next theorem involves terminology that we must first define. Suppose that
the power series (1) has circle of convergence |z − z0 | = R, and let S(z) and SN (z)
represent the sum and partial sums, respectively, of that series:
S(z) =

SN (z) =

Then write the remainder function (see Sec. 56)
(2)

ρN (z) = S(z) − SN (z)

(|z − z0 | < R).

210

Series

chap. 5

Since the power series converges for any fixed value of z when |z − z0 | < R, we know
that the remainder ρN (z) approaches zero for any such z as N tends to infinity. According to definition (2), Sec. 55, of the limit of a sequence, this means that corresponding
to each positive number ε, there is a positive integer Nε such that
|ρN (z)| < ε

(3)

whenever N > Nε .

When the choice of Nε depends only on the value of ε and is independent of the
point z taken in a specified region within the circle of convergence, the convergence
is said to be uniform in that region.
If z1 is a point inside the circle of convergence |z − z0 | = R of a

Our proof of this theorem depends on Theorem 1. Given that z1 is a point lying

circle and farther from z0 than z1 for which the series converges. So, according to
Theorem 1,

Consequently,
(8)

|ρN (z)| ≤ σN

when |z − z0 | ≤ R1 .

Since σN are the remainders of a convergent series, they tend to zero as N tends to
infinity. That is, for each positive number ε, an integer Nε exists such that
(9)

σN < ε

whenever N > Nε .

Because of conditions (8) and (9), then, condition (3) holds for all points z in the
disk |z − z0 | ≤ R1 ; and the value of Nε is independent of the choice of z. Hence
the convergence of series (4) is uniform in that disk.

64. CONTINUITY OF SUMS OF POWER SERIES
Our next theorem is an important consequence of uniform convergence, discussed
in the previous section.
Theorem. A power series
(1)

∞


an (z − z0 )n

n=0

represents a continuous function S(z) at each point inside its circle of convergence
|z − z0 | = R.
Another way to state this theorem is to say that if S(z) denotes the sum of
series (1) within its circle of convergence |z − z0 | = R and if z1 is a point inside
that circle, then for each positive number ε there is a positive number δ such that
(2)

|S(z) − S(z1 )| < ε

whenever |z − z1 | < δ.

212

Series

chap. 5

[See definition (4), Sec. 18, of continuity.] The number δ here is small enough so
that z lies in the domain of definition |z − z0 | < R of S(z) (Fig. 81).

FIGURE 81

To prove the theorem, we let Sn (z) denote the sum of the first N terms of series
(1) and write the remainder function
ρN (z) = S(z) − SN (z)

(|z − z0 | < R).

S(z) = SN (z) + ρN (z)

(|z − z0 | < R),

Then, because
one can see that
|S(z) − S(z1 )| = |SN (z) − SN (z1 ) + ρN (z) − ρN (z1 )|,
or
(3)

|S(z) − S(z1 )| ≤ |SN (z) − SN (z1 )| + |ρN (z)| + |ρN (z1 )|.

If z is any point lying in some closed disk |z − z0 | ≤ R0 whose radius R0 is greater
than |z1 − z0 | but less than the radius R of the circle of convergence of series (1)
(see Fig. 81), the uniform convergence stated in Theorem 2, Sec. 63, ensures that
there is a positive integer Nε such that
ε
|ρN (z)| <
whenever N > Nε .
(4)
3
In particular, condition (4) holds for each point z in some neighborhood |z − z1 | < δ
of z1 that is small enough to be contained in the disk |z − z0 | ≤ R0 .
Now the partial sum SN (z) is a polynomial and is, therefore, continuous at z1
for each value of N . In particular, when N = Nε + 1, we can choose our δ so small
that
ε
|SN (z) − SN (z1 )| <
(5)
whenever |z − z1 | < δ.

Thus, since inequality (7) is the same as |z − z0 | > |z1 − z0 |, series (6) must converge absolutely to a continuous function in the domain exterior to the circle
|z − z0 | = R1 , where R1 = |z1 − z0 |. Also, we know that if a Laurent series representation

In this section, we prove that the sum S(z) is actually analytic within that circle.
Our proof depends on the following theorem, which is of interest in itself.

Theorem 1. Let C denote any contour interior to the circle of convergence of
the power series (1), and let g(z) be any function that is continuous on C. The series
formed by multiplying each term of the power series by g(z) can be integrated term
by term over C; that is,

To prove this theorem, we note that since both g(z) and the sum S(z) of the
power series are continuous on C, the integral over C of the product
g(z)S(z) =



an g(z)(z − z0 )n + g(z)ρN (z),

where ρN (z) is the remainder of the given series after N terms, exists. The terms
of the finite sum here are also continuous on the contour C, and so their integrals
over C exist. Consequently, the integral of the quantity g(z)ρN (z) must exist; and
we may write

g(z)S(z) dz =

Now let M be the maximum value of |g(z)| on C, and let L denote the length
of C. In view of the uniform convergence of the given power series (Sec. 63), we
know that for each positive number ε there exists a positive integer Nε such that,
for all points z on C,
|ρN (z)| < ε

whenever N > Nε .

Since Nε is independent of z, we find that

If g(z) = 1 for each value of z in the open disk bounded by the circle of
convergence of power series (1), the fact that (z − z0 )n is entire when n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

for every such contour ; and, by Morera’s theorem (Sec. 52), the function S(z) is
analytic throughout the domain. We state this result as a corollary.
Corollary. The sum S(z) of power series (1) is analytic at each point z interior
to the circle of convergence of that series.
This corollary is often helpful in establishing the analyticity of functions and
in evaluating limits.
EXAMPLE 1.

To illustrate, let us show that the function defined by means

f (z) =

ez − 1 =

obtained by dividing each side of equation (4) by z, is valid when z = 0. But series
(5) clearly converges to f (0) when z = 0. Hence representation (5) is valid for all
z ; and f is, therefore, an entire function. Note that since (ez − 1)/z = f (z) when
z = 0 and since f is continuous at z = 0,
ez − 1
= lim f (z) = f (0) = 1.

The first limit here is, of course, also evident if we write it in the form
(ez − 1) − 0

which is the definition of the derivative of ez − 1 at z = 0.
We observed in Sec. 57 that the Taylor series for a function f about a point z0
converges to f (z) at each point z interior to the circle centered at z0 and passing
through the nearest point z1 where f fails to be analytic. In view of our corollary
to Theorem 1, we now know that there is no larger circle about z0 such that at each
point z interior to it the Taylor series converges to f (z). For if there were such a
circle, f would be analytic at z1 ; but f is not analytic at z1 .
We now present a companion to Theorem 1.
Theorem 2. The power series (1) can be differentiated term by term. That is,
at each point z interior to the circle of convergence of that series,


S (z) =

To prove this, let z denote any point interior to the circle of convergence of
series (1). Then let C be some positively oriented simple closed contour surrounding
z and interior to that circle. Also, define the function
g(s) =

Now S(z) is analytic inside and on C, and this enables us to write

g(s)S(s) ds =

with the aid of the integral representation for derivatives in Sec. 51. Furthermore,

66. UNIQUENESS OF SERIES REPRESENTATIONS
The uniqueness of Taylor and Laurent series representations, anticipated in Secs. 59
and 62, respectively, follows readily from Theorem 1 in Sec. 65. We consider first
the uniqueness of Taylor series representations.
Theorem 1.

If a series
∞


(1)

an (z − z0 )n

n=0

converges to f (z) at all points interior to some circle |z − z0 | = R, then it is the
Taylor series expansion for f in powers of z − z0 .
To start the proof, we write the series representation
f (z) =

(|z − z0 | < R).

m=0

Then, by appealing to Theorem 1 in Sec. 65, we may write

and C is some circle centered at z0 and with radius less than R.
In view of the extension (6), Sec. 51, of the Cauchy integral formula (see also
the corollary in Sec. 65), we find that

Because of equations (5) and (7), equation (3) now reduces to

This shows that series (2) is, in fact, the Taylor series for f about the point z0 .
Note how it follows from Theorem 1 that if series (1) converges to zero throughout some neighborhood of z0 , then the coefficients an must all be zero.
Our second theorem here concerns the uniqueness of Laurent series representations.

hypothesis of this theorem tells us that there is an annular domain about z0 such
that

for each point z in it. Let g(z) be as defined by equation (4), but now allow n to
be a negative integer too. Also, let C be any circle around the annulus, centered
at z0 and taken in the positive sense. Then, using the index of summation m and
adapting Theorem 1 in Sec. 65 to series involving both nonnegative and negative
powers of z − z0 (Exercise 10), write

CHAPTER

6
RESIDUES AND POLES

The Cauchy–Goursat theorem (Sec. 46) states that if a function is analytic at all
points interior to and on a simple closed contour C, then the value of the integral
of the function around that contour is zero. If, however, the function fails to be
analytic at a finite number of points interior to C, there is, as we shall see in this
chapter, a specific number, called a residue, which each of those points contributes
to the value of the integral. We develop here the theory of residues; and, in Chap. 7,
we shall illustrate their use in certain areas of applied mathematics.

68. ISOLATED SINGULAR POINTS
Recall (Sec. 24) that a point z0 is called a singular point of a function f if f fails
to be analytic at z0 but is analytic at some point in every neighborhood of z0 . A
singular point z0 is said to be isolated if, in addition, there is a deleted neighborhood
0 < |z − z0 | < ε of z0 throughout which f is analytic.
EXAMPLE 1. The function
z+1
z3 (z2 + 1)
has the three isolated singular points z = 0 and z = ±i.
EXAMPLE 2. The origin is a singular point of the principal branch (Sec. 31)
Log z = ln r + i

of the logarithmic function. It is not, however, an isolated singular point since every
deleted ε neighborhood of it contains points on the negative real axis (see Fig. 82)
and the branch is not even defined there. Similar remarks can be made regarding
any branch
log z = ln r + iθ
(r > 0, α < θ < α + 2π)
of the logarithmic function.

EXAMPLE 3. The function

sin(π/z)
has the singular points z = 0 and z = 1/n (n = ±1, ±2, . . .), all lying on the segment of the real axis from z = −1 to z = 1. Each singular point except z = 0 is
isolated. The singular point z = 0 is not isolated because every deleted ε neighborhood of the origin contains other singular points of the function. More precisely,
when a positive number ε is specified and m is any positive integer such that
m > 1/ε, the fact that 0 < 1/m < ε means that the point z = 1/m lies in the deleted
ε neighborhood 0 < |z| < ε (Fig. 83).

231

In this chapter, it will be important to keep in mind that if a function is analytic
everywhere inside a simple closed contour C except for a finite number of singular
points
z1 , z2 , . . . , zn ,
those points must all be isolated and the deleted neighborhoods about them can be
made small enough to lie entirely inside C. To see that this is so, consider any
one of the points zk . The radius ε of the needed deleted neighborhood can be any
positive number that is smaller than the distances to the other singular points and
also smaller than the distance from zk to the closest point on C.
Finally, we mention that it is sometimes convenient to consider the point
at infinity (Sec. 17) as an isolated singular point. To be specific, if there is a
positive number R1 such that f is analytic for R1 < |z| < ∞, then f is said to
have an isolated singular point at z0 = ∞. Such a singular point will be used in
Sec. 71.

69. RESIDUES
When z0 is an isolated singular point of a function f , there is a positive number R2
such that f is analytic at each point z for which 0 < |z − z0 | < R2 . Consequently,
f (z) has a Laurent series representation

becomes

(2)
f (z) dz = 2πib1 .

The complex number b1 , which is the coefficient of 1/(z − z0 ) in expansion (1), is
called the residue of f at the isolated singular point z0 , and we shall often write
b1 = Res f (z).

well. With the aid of the Maclaurin series representation (Sec. 59)

The residue of the integrand at its isolated singular point z = 0 is, therefore, zero
(b1 = 0), and the value of integral (5) is established.
We are reminded in this example that although the analyticity of a function
within and on a simple closed contour C is a sufficient condition for the value of
the integral around C to be zero, it is not a necessary condition.

70. CAUCHY’S RESIDUE THEOREM
If, except for a finite number of singular points, a function f is analytic inside a
simple closed contour C, those singular points must be isolated (Sec. 68). The following theorem, which is known as Cauchy’s residue theorem, is a precise statement
of the fact that if f is also analytic on C and if C is positively oriented, then the

value of the integral of f around C is 2πi times the sum of the residues of f at
the singular points inside C.
Theorem. Let C be a simple closed contour, described in the positive sense.

To prove the theorem, let the points zk (k = 1, 2, . . . , n) be centers of positively
oriented circles Ck which are interior to C and are so small that no two of them have
points in common. The circles Ck , together with the simple closed contour C, form
the boundary of a closed region throughout which f is analytic and whose interior
is a multiply connected domain consisting of the points inside C and exterior to
each Ck . Hence, according to the adaptation of the Cauchy–Goursat theorem to such
domains (Sec. 49),

where C is the circle |z| = 2, described counterclockwise. The integrand has the

Suppose that a function f is analytic throughout the finite plane except for a finite
number of singular points interior to a positively oriented simple closed contour C.
Next, let R1 denote a positive number which is large enough that C lies inside the
circle |z| = R1 (see Fig. 89). The function f is evidently analytic throughout the
domain R1 < |z| < ∞ and, as already mentioned at the end of Sec. 68, the point at
infinity is then said to be an isolated singular point of f .

Note that the circle C0 keeps the point at infinity on the left, just as the singular
point in the finite plane is on the left in equation (3), Sec. 69. Since f is analytic

72. THE THREE TYPES OF ISOLATED SINGULAR POINTS

isolated singular point at z0 , then f (z) has a Laurent series representation

f (z) =

z − z0

(z − z0 )n

of the series, involving negative powers of z − z0 , is called the principal part of f
at z0 . We now use the principal part to identify the isolated singular point z0 as one
of three special types. This classification will aid us in the development of residue
theory that appears in following sections.
If the principal part of f at z0 contains at least one nonzero term but the number
of such terms is only finite, then there exists a positive integer m (m ≥ 1) such that
bm = 0 and bm+1 = bm+2 = · · · = 0.

There remain two extremes, the case in which every coefficient in the principal
part (2) is zero and the one in which an infinie number of them are nonzero.
When every bn is zero, so that

(0 < |z − z0 | < R2 ),
z0 is known as a removable singular point. Note that the residue at a removable
singular point is always zero. If we define, or possibly redefine, f at z0 so that
f (z0 ) = a0 , expansion (4) becomes valid throughout the entire disk |z − z0 | < R2 .
Since a power series always represents an analytic function interior to its circle of
convergence (Sec. 65), it follows that f is analytic at z0 when it is assigned the
value a0 there. The singularity z0 is, therefore, removed.
EXAMPLE 4.

The point z0 = 0 is a removable singular point of the function
f (z) =

When the value f (0) = 1/2 is assigned, f becomes entire.
If an infinite number of the coefficients bn in the principal part (2) are nonzero,

From this we see that e1/z has an essential singular point at z0 = 0, where the
residue b1 is unity.
This example can be used to illustrate (see Exercise 4) an important result known
as Picard’s theorem. It concerns the behavior of a function near an essential singular
point and states that in each neighborhood of an essential singular point, a function
assumes every finite value, with one possible exception, an infinite number of times.∗

In the remaining sections of this chapter, we shall develop in greater depth
the theory of the three types of isolated singular points just described. The emphasis will be on useful and efficient methods for identifying poles and finding the
corresponding residues.

(c) m = 2, B = 2e 2 .

3. Suppose that a function f is analytic at z0 , and write g(z) = f (z)/(z − z0 ). Show that
(a) if f (z0 ) = 0, then z0 is a simple pole of g, with residue f (z0 );
(b) if f (z0 ) = 0, then z0 is a removable singular point of g.
Suggestion: As pointed out in Sec. 57, there is a Taylor series for f (z) about z 0
since f is analytic there. Start each part of this exercise by writing out a few terms
of that series.
4. Use the fact (see Sec. 29) that ez = −1 when
z = (2n + 1)π i

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .)

to show that e1/z assumes the value −1 an infinite number of times in each neighborhood of the origin. More precisely, show that e 1/z = −1 when
z=−

i
(2n + 1)π

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .);

then note that if n is large enough, such points lie in any given ε neighborhood
of the origin. Zero is evidently the exceptional value in Picard’s theorem, stated in
Example 5, Sec. 72.

73. RESIDUES AT POLES
When a function f has an isolated singularity at a point z0 , the basic method for
identifying z0 as a pole and finding the residue there is to write the appropriate
Laurent series and to note the coefficient of 1/(z − z0 ). The following theorem
provides an alternative characterization of poles and a way of finding residues at
poles that is often more convenient.
Theorem. An isolated singular point z0 of a function f is a pole of order m
if and only if f (z) can be written in the form
f (z) =

(1)

φ(z)
,
(z − z0 )m

where φ(z) is analytic and nonzero at z0 . Moreover,
Res f (z) = φ(z0 ) if m = 1

(2)

z=z0

and
Res f (z) =

(3)

z=z0

φ (m−1) (z0 )
(m − 1)!

if m ≥ 2.

Observe that expression (2) need not have been written separately since, with
the convention that φ (0) (z0 ) = φ(z0 ) and 0! = 1, expression (3) reduces to it when
m = 1.
To prove the theorem, we first assume that f (z) has the form (1) and recall
(Sec. 57) that since φ(z) is analytic at z0 , it has a Taylor series representation
φ(z) = φ(z0 ) +

when 0 < |z − z0 | < ε. This Laurent series representation, together with the fact
that φ(z0 ) = 0, reveals that z0 is, indeed, a pole of order m of f (z). The coefficient
of 1/(z − z0 ) tells us, of course, that the residue of f (z) at z0 is as in the statement
of the theorem.
Suppose, on the other hand, that we know only that z0 is a pole of order m of
f , or that f (z) has a Laurent series representation

throughout the entire disk |z − z0 | < R2 . Consequently, φ(z) is analytic in that disk
(Sec. 65) and, in particular, at z0 . Inasmuch as φ(z0 ) = bm = 0, expression (1) is
established; and the proof of the theorem is complete.

74. EXAMPLES
The following examples serve to illustrate the use of the theorem in Sec. 73.
EXAMPLE 1. The function
f (z) =

z+1
z2 + 9

has an isolated singular point at z = 3i and can be written
f (z) =

φ(z)
z − 3i

where φ(z) =

z+1
.
z + 3i

Since φ(z) is analytic at z = 3i and φ(3i) = 0, that point is a simple pole of the
function f ; and the residue there is
B1 = φ(3i) =

then

B=

The theorem can, of course, be used when branches of multiple-valued functions
are involved.

f (z) =

(log z)3
,
z2 + 1

where the branch
log z = ln r + iθ

(r > 0, 0 < θ < 2π)

of the logarithmic function is to be used. To find the residue of f at the singularity
z = i, we write
(log z)3
φ(z)
where φ(z) =

f (z) =
z−i

While the theorem in Sec. 73 can be extremely useful, the identification of an
isolated singular point as a pole of a certain order is sometimes done most efficiently
by appealing directly to a Laurent series.

EXAMPLE 4. If, for instance, the residue of the function
f (z) =

sinh z
z4

is needed at the singularity z = 0, it would be incorrect to write
f (z) =

φ(z)
z4

where φ(z) = sinh z

and to attempt an application of formula (3) in Sec. 73 with m = 4. For it is
necessary that φ(z0 ) = 0 if that formula is to be used. In this case, the simplest way
to find the residue is to write out a few terms of the Laurent series for f (z), as was
done in Example 3 of Sec. 72. There it was shown that z = 0 is a pole of the third
order, with residue B = 1/6.
In some cases, the series approach can be effectively combined with the theorem
in Sec. 73.
EXAMPLE 5. Since z(e z − 1) is entire and its zeros are
z = 2nπi

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .),

the point z = 0 is clearly an isolated singular point of the function
f (z) =

Since φ(z) is analytic at z = 0 and φ(0) = 1 = 0, the point z = 0 is a pole of the
second order; and, according to formula (3) in Sec. 73, the residue is B = φ  (0).
Because

φ  (z) =
(1 + z/2! + z2 /3! + · · ·)2
in a neighborhood of the origin, then, B = −1/2.
This residue can also be found by dividing our series for z(ez − 1) into 1, or
by multiplying the Laurent series for 1/(ez − 1) in Exercise 3, Sec. 67, by 1/z.

Suggestion: Since there is a neighborhood |z − z0 | < ε throughout which φ(z) is

be the positively oriented circle |z − z0 | = ε/2.

75. ZEROS OF ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS
Zeros and poles of functions are closely related. In fact, we shall see in the next
section how zeros can be a source of poles. We need, however, some preliminary
results regarding zeros of analytic functions.
Suppose that a function f is analytic at a point z0 . We know from Sec. 52 that
all of the derivatives f (n) (z) (n = 1, 2, . . .) exist at z0 . If f (z0 ) = 0 and if there
is a positive integer m such that f (m) (z0 ) = 0 and each derivative of lower order
vanishes at z0 , then f is said to have a zero of order m at z0 . Our first theorem
here provides a useful alternative characterization of zeros of order m.
Theorem 1. Let a function f be analytic at a point z0 . It has a zero of order
m at z0 if and only if there is a function g, which is analytic and nonzero at z0 , such
that
f (z) = (z − z0 )m g(z).

(1)

Both parts of the proof that follows use the fact (Sec. 57) that if a function is
analytic at a point z0 , then it must have a Taylor series representation in powers of
z − z0 which is valid throughout a neighborhood |z − z0 | < ε of z0 .
We start the first part of the proof by assuming that expression (1) holds and
noting that since g(z) is analytic at z0 , it has a Taylor series representation
g(z) = g(z0 ) +

g  (z0 )
g  (z0 )
(z − z0 ) +
(z − z0 )2 + · · ·
1!
2!

in some neighborhood |z − z0 | < ε of z0 . Expression (1) thus takes the form
f (z) = g(z0 )(z − z0 )m +

g  (z0 )
g  (z0 )
(z − z0 )m+1 +
(z − z0 )m+2 + · · ·
1!
2!

when |z − z0 | < ε. Since this is actually a Taylor series expansion for f (z), according to Theorem 1 in Sec. 66, it follows that
(2)

f (z0 ) = f  (z0 ) = f  (z0 ) = · · · = f (m−1) (z0 ) = 0

and that
f (m) (z0 ) = m!g(z0 ) = 0.

(3)

Hence z0 is a zero of order m of f .
Conversely, if we assume that f has a zero of order m at z0 , the analyticity
of f at z0 and the fact that conditions (2) hold tell us that in some neighborhood
|z − z0 | < ε, there is a Taylor series
f (z) =

where g(z) = z2 + 2z + 4, and because f and g are entire and g(2) = 12 = 0.
Note how the fact that z0 = 2 is a zero of order m = 1 of f also follows from the

f (2) = 0 and f  (2) = 12 = 0.

In this case, expression (1) becomes

where g is the entire function (see Example 1, Sec. 65) defined by means of the
equations
 z
(e − 1)/z when z = 0,
g(z) =
1
when z = 0.
Our next theorem tells us that the zeros of an analytic function are isolated
when the function is not identically equal to zero.
Theorem 2. Given a function f and a point z0 , suppose that
(a) f is analytic at z0 ;
(b) f (z0 ) = 0 but f (z) is not identically equal to zero in any neighborhood of z0 .
Then f (z) = 0 throughout some deleted neighborhood 0 < |z − z0 | < ε of z0 .
To prove this, let f be as stated and observe that not all of the derivatives of
f at z0 are zero. If they were, all of the coefficients in the Taylor series for f about
z0 would be zero ; and that would mean that f (z) is identically equal to zero in
some neighborhood of z0 . So it is clear from the definition of zeros of order m at
the beginning of this section that f must have a zero of some finite order m at z0 .
According to Theorem 1, then,
(4)

f (z) = (z − z0 )m g(z)

where g(z) is analytic and nonzero at z0 .
Now g is continuous, in addition to being nonzero, at z0 because it is analytic there. Hence there is some neighborhood |z − z0 | < ε in which equation (4)
holds and in which g(z) = 0 (see Sec. 18). Consequently, f (z) = 0 in the deleted
neighborhood 0 < |z − z0 | < ε; and the proof is complete.
Our final theorem here concerns functions with zeros that are not all isolated.
It was referred to earlier in Sec. 27 and makes an interesting contrast to Theorem 2
just above.
Theorem 3. Given a function f and a point z0 , suppose that
(a) f is analytic throughout a neighborhood N0 of z0 ;
(b) f (z) = 0 at each point z of a domain D or line segment L containing z0
(Fig. 90).
Then f (z) ≡ 0 in N0 ; that is, f (z) is identically equal to zero throughout N0 .
We begin the proof with the observation that under the stated conditions,
f (z) ≡ 0 in some neighborhood N of z0 . For, otherwise, there would be a deleted
neighborhood of z0 throughout which f (z) = 0, according to Theorem 2 ; and that
would be inconsistent with the condition that f (z) = 0 everywhere in a domain D

or on a line segment L containing z0 . Since f (z) ≡ 0 in the neighborhood N , then,
it follows that all of the coefficients

(n = 0, 1, 2, . . .)

in the Taylor series for f (z) about z0 must be zero. Thus f (z) ≡ 0 in the neighborhood
N0 , since the Taylor series also represents f (z) in N0 . This completes the proof.

76. ZEROS AND POLES
The following theorem shows how zeros of order m can create poles of order m.
Theorem 1. Suppose that
(a) two functions p and q are analytic at a point z0 ;
(b) p(z0 ) = 0 and q has a zero of order m at z0 .
Then the quotient p(z)/q(z) has a pole of order m at z0 .
The proof is easy. Let p and q be as in the statement of the theorem. Since q has
a zero of order m at z0 , we know from Theorem 2 in Sec. 75 that there is a deleted
neighborhood of z0 throughout which q(z) = 0 ; and so z0 is an isolated singular
point of the quotient p(z)/q(z). Theorem 1 in Sec. 75 tells us, moreover, that
q(z) = (z − z0 )m g(z),
where g is analytic and nonzero at z0 ; and this enables us to write
(1)

φ(z)
p(z)
=
q(z)
(z − z0 )m

where φ(z) =

p(z)
.
g(z)

Since φ(z) is analytic and nonzero at z0 , it now follows from the theorem in Sec.
73 that z0 is a pole of order m of p(z)/q(z).

EXAMPLE 1. The two functions
p(z) = 1 and q(z) = z(ez − 1)
are entire; and we know from Example 2 in Sec. 75 that q has a zero of order
m = 2 at the point z0 = 0. Hence it follows from Theorem 1 that the quotient
p(z)
1
=
q(z)
z(ez − 1)
has a pole of order 2 at that point. This was demonstrated in another way in
Example 5, Sec. 74.
Theorem 1 leads us to another method for identifying simple poles and finding the corresponding residues. This method, stated just below as Theorem 2, is
sometimes easier to use than the theorem in Sec. 73.
Theorem 2. Let two functions p and q be analytic at a point z0 . If
p(z0 ) = 0,

and q  (z0 ) = 0,

q(z0 ) = 0,

then z0 is a simple pole of the quotient p(z)/q(z) and
(2)

q  (z0 )

To show this, we assume that p and q are as stated and observe that because of
the conditions on q, the point z0 is a zero of order m = 1 of that function. According
to Theorem 1 in Sec. 75, then,
q(z) = (z − z0 )g(z)

(3)

where g(z) is analytic and nonzero at z0 . Furthermore, Theorem 1 in this section
tells us that z0 is a simple pole of p(z)/q(z); and expression (1) for p(z)/q(z) in
the proof of that theorem becomes
φ(z)
p(z)
=
q(z)
z − z0

where φ(z) =

p(z)

g(z)

Since this φ(z) is analytic and nonzero at z0 , we know from the theorem in Sec. 73
that

But g(z0 ) = q  (z0 ), as is seen by differentiating each side of equation (3) and then
setting z = z0 . Expression (4) thus takes the form (2).

which is a quotient of the entire functions p(z) = cos z and q(z) = sin z. Its singularities occur at the zeros of q, or at the points
z = nπ

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

Since
p(nπ) = (−1)n = 0,

q(nπ) = 0,

theorem can be stated as follows: an infinite set of points lying in a closed bounded
region R has at least one accumulation point in R.∗ Use that theorem and Theorem 2
in Sec. 75 to show that if a function f is analytic in the region R consisting of all
points inside and on a simple closed contour C, except possibly for poles inside C,
and if all the zeros of f in R are interior to C and are of finite order, then those zeros
must be finite in number.
11. Let R denote the region consisting of all points inside and on a simple closed contour
C. Use the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem (see Exercise 10) and the fact that poles are
isolated singular points to show that if f is analytic in the region R except for poles
interior to C, then those poles must be finite in number.

77. BEHAVIOR OF FUNCTIONS NEAR ISOLATED
SINGULAR POINTS
As already indicated in Sec. 72, the behavior of a function f near an isolated singular
point z0 varies, depending on whether z0 is a pole, a removable singular point, or
an essential singular point. In this section, we develop the differences in behavior
somewhat further. Since the results presented here will not be used elsewhere in the
book, the reader who wishes to reach applications of residue theory more quickly
may pass directly to Chap. 7 without disruption.
Theorem 1. If z0 is a pole of a function f , then
(1)

lim f (z) = ∞.

z→z0

To verify limit (1), we assume that f has a pole of order m at z0 and use the
theorem in Sec. 73. It tells us that
φ(z)
f (z) =

(z − z0 )m
where φ(z) is analytic and nonzero at z0 . Since

then, limit (1) holds, according to the theorem in Sec. 17 regarding limits that
involve the point at infinity.
The next theorem emphasizes how the behavior of f near a removable singular
point is fundamentally different from behavior near a pole.
Theorem 2. If z0 is a removable singular point of a function f , then f is analytic
and bounded in some deleted neighborhood 0 < |z − z0 | < ε of z0 .
The proof is easy and is based on the fact that the function f here is analytic
in a disk |z − z0 | < R2 when f (z0 ) is properly defined ; f is then continuous in
any closed disk |z − z0 | ≤ ε where ε < R2 . Consequently, f is bounded in that
disk, according to Theorem 3 in Sec. 18; and this means that, in addition to being
analytic, f must be bounded in the deleted neighborhood 0 < |z − z0 | < ε.
The proof of our final theorem, regarding the behavior of a function near an
essential singular point, relies on the following lemma, which is closely related to
Theorem 2 and is known as Riemann’s theorem.
Lemma. Suppose that a function f is analytic and bounded in some deleted
neighborhood 0 < |z − z0 | < ε of a point z0 . If f is not analytic at z0 , then it has
a removable singularity there.
To prove this, we assume that f is not analytic at z0 . As a consequence, the
point z0 must be an isolated singularity of f ; and f (z) is represented by a Laurent
series
f (z) =

coefficients bn in expansion (2) can be written

f (z) dz
1
(3)
bn =
2πi C (z − z0 )−n+1

(n = 1, 2, . . .).

Now the boundedness condition on f tells us that there is a positive constant M
such that |f (z)| ≤ M whenever 0 < |z − z0 | < ε. Hence it follows from expression
(3) that
M
1
|bn | ≤
·
2πρ = Mρ n
(n = 1, 2, . . .).
2π ρ −n+1
Since the coefficients bn are constants and since ρ can be chosen arbitrarily small,
we may conclude that bn = 0 (n = 1, 2, . . .) in the Laurent series (2). This tells us
that z0 is a removable singularity of f , and the proof of the lemma is complete.
We know from Sec. 72 that the behavior of a function near an essential singular
point is quite irregular. The next theorem, regarding such behavior, is related to
Picard’s theorem in that earlier section and is usually referred to as the Casorati–
Weierstrass theorem. It states that in each deleted neighborhood of an essential
singular point, a function assumes values arbitrarily close to any given number.
Theorem 3. Suppose that z0 is an essential singularity of a function f , and
let w0 be any complex number. Then, for any positive number ε, the inequality
|f (z) − w0 | < ε

(4)

is satisfied at some point z in each deleted neighborhood 0 < |z − z0 | < δ of z0
(Fig. 92).

The proof is by contradiction. Since z0 is an isolated singularity of f , there

Residues and Poles

assume that condition (4) is not satisfied for any point z there. Thus |f (z) − w0 | ≥ ε
when 0 < |z − z0 | < δ; and so the function
(5)

g(z) =

1
f (z) − w0

(0 < |z − z0 | < δ)

is bounded and analytic in its domain of definition. Hence, according to our lemma,
z0 is a removable singularity of g; and we let g be defined at z0 so that it is analytic
there.
If g(z0 ) = 0, the function f (z), which can be written
(6)

f (z) =

1
+ w0
g(z)

when 0 < |z − z0 | < δ, becomes analytic at z0 when it is defined there as
f (z0 ) =

1
+ w0 .
g(z0 )

But this means that z0 is a removable singularity of f , not an essential one, and we
have a contradiction.
If g(z0 ) = 0, the function g must have a zero of some finite order m (Sec. 75)
at z0 because g(z) is not identically equal to zero in the neighborhood |z − z0 | < δ.
In view of equation (6), then, f has a pole of order m at z0 (see Theorem 1 in
Sec. 76). So, once again, we have a contradiction; and Theorem 3 here is proved.

APPLICATIONS OF RESIDUES

We turn now to some important applications of the theory of residues, which was
developed in Chap. 6. The applications include evaluation of certain types of definite and improper integrals occurring in real analysis and applied mathematics.
Considerable attention is also given to a method, based on residues, for locating
zeros of functions and to finding inverse Laplace transforms by summing residues.

78. EVALUATION OF IMPROPER INTEGRALS

f (x) dx.

When the limit on the right exists, the improper integral is said to converge to that
limit. If f (x) is continuous for all x, its improper integral over the infinite interval

and when both of the limits here exist, we say that integral (2) converges to their
sum. Another value that is assigned to integral (2) is often useful. Namely, the

If integral (2) converges, its Cauchy principal value (3) exists; and that value
is the number to which integral (2) converges. This is because

We now describe a method involving sums of residues, to be illustrated in the
next section, that is often used to evaluate improper integrals of rational functions
f (x) = p(x)/q(x), where p(x) and q(x) are polynomials with real coefficients and
no factors in common. We agree that q(z) has no real zeros but has at least one
zero above the real axis.
The method begins with the identification of all the distinct zeros of the polynomial q(z) that lie above the real axis. They are, of course, finite in number (see
Sec. 53) and may be labeled z1 , z2 , . . . , zn , where n is less than or equal to the
degree of q(z). We then integrate the quotient

the points z1 , z2 , . . . , zn all lie inside the closed path.

has isolated singularities at the zeros of z6 + 1, which are the sixth roots of −1,
and is analytic everywhere else. The method in Sec. 9 for finding roots of complex

c1 = i,

and c2 = ei5π/6 ,

lie in the upper half plane (Fig. 94) and the other three lie in the lower one.
When R > 1, the points ck (k = 0, 1, 2) lie in the interior of the semicircular region
bounded by the segment z = x (−R ≤ x ≤ R) of the real axis and the upper half
CR of the circle |z| = R from z = R to z = −R. Integrating f (z) counterclockwise

Next, we show that the value of the integral on the right in equation (2) tends

|z2 | = |z|2 = R 2

|z6 + 1| ≥ | |z|6 − 1| = R 6 − 1.

where a denotes a positive constant. As in Sec. 78, we assume that f (x) = p(x)/q(x)
where p(x) and q(x) are polynomials with real coefficients and no factors in common.
Also, q(x) has no zeros on the real axis and at least one zero above it. Integrals of
type (1) occur in the theory and application of the Fourier integral.∗
The method described in Sec. 78 and used in Sec. 79 cannot be applied directly
here since (see Sec. 34)
|sin az|2 = sin2 ax + sinh2 ay
and
|cos az|2 = cos2 ax + sinh2 ay.
More precisely, since

In the evaluation of integrals of the type treated in Sec. 80, it is sometimes necessary
to use Jordan’s lemma,∗ which is stated just below as a theorem.
Theorem.

Suppose that

(a) a function f (z) is analytic at all points in the upper half plane y ≥ 0 that are
exterior to a circle |z| = R0 ;
(b) CR denotes a semicircle z = Reiθ (0 ≤ θ ≤ π), where R > R0 (Fig. 97);
(c) for all points z on CR , there is a positive constant MR such that
lim MR = 0.

|f (z)| ≤ MR and

The proof is based on Jordan’s inequality:

To verify it, we first note from the graphs (Fig. 98) of the functions

and y =

(R > 0).

But this is just another form of inequality (1), since the graph of y = sin θ is
symmetric with respect to the vertical line θ = π/2 on the interval 0 ≤ θ ≤ π.
Turning now to the proof of the theorem, we accept statements (a)–(c) there
and write

82. INDENTED PATHS
In this and the following section, we illustrate the use of indented paths. We begin
with an important limit that will be used in the example in this section.
Theorem. Suppose that
(a) a function f (z) has a simple pole at a point z = x0 on the real axis, with a Laurent
series representation in a punctured disk 0 < |z − x0 | < R2 (Fig. 100) and with
residue B0 ;
(b) Cρ denotes the upper half of a circle |z − x0 | = ρ, where ρ < R2 and the clockwise direction is taken.
Then

Assuming that the conditions in parts (a) and (b) are satisfied, we start the
proof of the theorem by writing the Laurent series in part (a) as
B0
z − x0

(0 < |z − x0 | < R2 )

an (z − x0 )n

(|z − x0 | < R2 ).

f (z) = g(z) +

Thus

Cρ z − x0

Now the function g(z) is continuous when |z − x0 | < R2 , according to the
theorem in Sec. 64. Hence if we choose a number ρ0 such that ρ < ρ0 < R2 (see
Fig. 100), it must be bounded on the closed disk |z − x0 | ≤ ρ0 , according to Sec.
18. That is, there is a nonnegative constant M such that
|g(z)| ≤ M

whenever |z − x0 | ≤ ρ0 ;

and since the length L of the path Cρ is L = πρ, it follows that

84. INTEGRATION ALONG A BRANCH CUT
Cauchy’s residue theorem can be useful in evaluating a real integral when part of
the path of integration of the function f (z) to which the theorem is applied lies
along a branch cut of that function.
EXAMPLE. Let x −a , where x > 0 and 0 < a < 1, denote the principal value
of the indicated power of x; that is, x −a is the positive real number exp(−a ln x).
We shall evaluate here the improper real integral
 ∞ −a
x
(1)
dx
(0 < a < 1),
x+1

which is important in the study of the gamma function.∗ Note that integral (1)
is improper not only because of its upper limit of integration but also because
its integrand has an infinite discontinuity at x = 0. The integral converges when
0 < a < 1 since the integrand behaves like x −a near x = 0 and like x −a−1 as x
∗ See, for example, p. 4 of the book by Lebedev cited in Appendix 1.

tends to infinity. We do not, however, need to establish convergence separately; for
that will be contained in our evaluation of the integral.
We begin by letting Cρ and CR denote the circles |z| = ρ and |z| = R, respectively, where ρ < 1 < R; and we assign them the orientations shown in Fig. 103.
We then integrate the branch
z−a
z+1

f (z) =

(|z| > 0, 0 < arg z < 2π)

of the multiple-valued function z−a /(z + 1), with branch cut arg z = 0, around the
simple closed contour indicated in Fig. 103. That contour is traced out by a point
moving from ρ to R along the top of the branch cut for f (z), next around CR and
back to R, then along the bottom of the cut to ρ, and finally around Cρ back to ρ.

Integration Along a Branch Cut

Our derivation of equation (3) is, of course, only formal since f (z) is not analytic,
or even defined, on the branch cut involved. It is, nevertheless, valid and can be
fully justified by an argument such as the one in Exercise 8 of this section.
The residue in equation (3) can be found by noting that the function
φ(z) = z−a = exp(−a log z) = exp[−a(ln r + iθ )]

(r > 0, 0 < θ < 2π)

is analytic at z = −1 and that
φ(−1) = exp[−a(ln 1 + iπ)] = e−iaπ = 0.
This shows that the point z = −1 is a simple pole of the function (2) and that
Res f (z) = e−iaπ .

z=−1

Equation (3) can, therefore, be written as

86. ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE
A function f is said to be meromorphic in a domain D if it is analytic throughout
D except for poles. Suppose now that f is meromorphic in the domain interior to
a positively oriented simple closed contour C and that it is analytic and nonzero
on C. The image  of C under the transformation w = f (z) is a closed contour,
not necessarily simple, in the w plane (Fig. 106). As a point z traverses C in the
positive direction, its images w traverses  in a particular direction that determines
the orientation of . Note that since f has no zeros on C, the contour  does not
pass through the origin in the w plane.

Let w0 and w be points on , where w0 is fixed and φ0 is a value of arg w0 .
Then let arg w vary continuously, starting with the value φ0 , as the point w begins
at the point w0 and traverses  once in the direction of orientation assigned to it

chap. 7

by the mapping w = f (z). When w returns to the point w0 , where it started, arg w
assumes a particular value of arg w0 , which we denote by φ1 . Thus the change in
arg w as w describes  once in its direction of orientation is φ1 − φ0 . This change
is, of course, independent of the point w0 chosen to determine it. Since w = f (z),
the number φ1 − φ0 is, in fact, the change in argument of f (z) as z describes C
once in the positive direction, starting with a point z0 ; and we write
C arg f (z) = φ1 − φ0 .
The value of C arg f (z) is evidently an integral multiple of 2π, and the integer
1
C arg f (z)
2π
represents the number of times the point w winds around the origin in the w plane.
For that reason, this integer is sometimes called the winding number of  with
respect to the origin w = 0. It is positive if  winds around the origin in the
counterclockwise direction and negative if it winds clockwise around that point. The
winding number is always zero when  does not enclose the origin. The verification
of this fact for a special case is left to the reader (Exercise 3, Sec. 87).
The winding number can be determined from the number of zeros and poles of
f interior to C. The number of poles is necessarily finite, according to Exercise 11,
Sec. 76. Likewise, with the understanding that f (z) is not identically equal to zero
everywhere else inside C, it is easily shown (Exercise 4, Sec. 87) that the zeros of
f are finite in number and are all of finite order. Suppose now that f has Z zeros
and P poles in the domain interior to C. We agree that f has m0 zeros at a point z0
if it has a zero of order m0 there; and if f has a pole of order mp at z0 , that pole is
to be counted mp times. The following theorem, which is known as the argument
principle, states that the winding number is simply the difference Z − P .
Theorem. Let C denote a positively oriented simple closed contour, and suppose that
(a) a function f (z) is meromorphic in the domain interior to C;
(b) f (z) is analytic and nonzero on C;
(c) counting multiplicities, Z is the number of zeros and P the number of poles of
f (z) inside C.
Then
1
C arg f (z) = Z − P .
2π
To prove this, we evaluate the integral of f  (z)/f (z) around C in two different ways. First, we let z = z(t) (a ≤ t ≤ b) be a parametric representation for C,
so that

Argument Principle

293

Since, under the transformation w = f (z), the image  of C never passes through
the origin in the w plane, the image of any point z = z(t) on C can be expressed
in exponential form as w = ρ(t) exp[iφ(t)]. Thus
f [z(t)] = ρ(t)eiφ(t)

(2)

(a ≤ t ≤ b);

and, along each of the smooth arcs making up the contour , it follows that (see
Exercise 5, Sec. 39)
(3)

f  [z(t)]z (t) =

d

f [z(t)] = [ρ(t)eiφ(t) ] = ρ  (t)eiφ(t) + iρ(t)eiφ(t) φ  (t).

Inasmuch as ρ  (t) and φ  (t) are piecewise continuous on the interval a ≤ t ≤ b, we
can now use expressions (2) and (3) to write integral (1) as follows:

and φ(b) − φ(a) = C arg f (z).

f  (z)
dz = iC arg f (z).
C f (z)

Another way to evaluate integral (4) is to use Cauchy’s residue theorem. To
be specific, we observe that the integrand f  (z)/f (z) is analytic inside and on C
except at the points inside C at which the zeros and poles of f occur. If f has a
zero of order m0 at z0 , then (Sec. 75)
(5)

f (z) = (z − z0 )m0 g(z),

where g(z) is analytic and nonzero at z0 . Hence
f  (z0 ) = m0 (z − z0 )m0 −1 g(z) + (z − z0 )m0 g  (z),
or
(6)

f (z)

Since g  (z)/g(z) is analytic at z0 , it has a Taylor series representation about that
point ; and so equation (6) tells us that f  (z)/f (z) has a simple pole at z0 , with
residue m0 . If, on the other hand, f has a pole of order mp at z0 , we know from
the theorem in Sec. 73 that
(7)

f (z) = (z − z0 )−mp φ(z),

where φ(z) is analytic and nonzero at z0 . Because expression (7) has the same form
as expression (5), with the positive integer m0 in equation (5) replaced by −mp ,

it is clear from equation (6) that f  (z)/f (z) has a simple pole at z0 , with residue
−mp . Applying the residue theorem, then, we find that

The conclusion in the theorem now follows by equating the right-hand sides

EXAMPLE. The only singularity of the function 1/z2 is a pole of order 2
at the origin, and there are no zeros in the finite plane. In particular, this function
is analytic and nonzero on the unit circle z = eiθ (0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π). If we let C denote

That is, the image  of C under the transformation w = 1/z2 winds around the
origin w = 0 twice in the clockwise direction. This can be verified directly by
noting that  has the parametric representation w = e−i2θ (0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π).

87. ROUCHÉ’S THEOREM
The main result in this section is known as Rouché’s theorem and is a consequence
of the argument principle, just developed in Sec. 86. It can be useful in locating
regions of the complex plane in which a given analytic function has zeros.
Theorem.

Let C denote a simple closed contour, and suppose that

(a) two functions f (z) and g(z) are analytic inside and on C;
(b) |f (z)| > |g(z)| at each point on C.
Then f (z) and f (z) + g(z) have the same number of zeros, counting multiplicities,
inside C.
The orientation of C in the statement of the theorem is evidently immaterial.
Thus, in the proof here, we may assume that the orientation is positive. We begin
with the observation that neither the function f (z) nor the sum f (z) + g(z) has a
zero on C, since
|f (z)| > |g(z)| ≥ 0 and |f (z) + g(z)| ≥ | |f (z)| − |g(z)| | > 0
when z is on C.
If Zf and Zf +g denote the number of zeros, counting multiplicities, of f (z)
and f (z) + g(z), respectively, inside C, we know from the theorem in Sec. 86
that

But
|F (z) − 1| =

f (z)

|g(z)|
< 1;
|f (z)|

and this means that under the transformation w = F (z), the image of C lies in the
open disk |w − 1| < 1. That image does not, then, enclose the origin w = 0. Hence
C arg F (z) = 0 and, since equation (1) reduces to Zf +g = Zf , Rouché’s theorem
is proved.
EXAMPLE 1.

In order to determine the number of roots of the equation
z7 − 4z3 + z − 1 = 0

(2)
inside the circle |z| = 1, write

f (z) = −4z3

and g(z) = z7 + z − 1.

Then observe that |f (z)| = 4|z|3 = 4 and |g(z)| ≤ |z|7 + |z| + 1 = 3 when |z| = 1.
The conditions in Rouché’s theorem are thus satisfied. Consequently, since f (z) has
three zeros, counting multiplicities, inside the circle |z| = 1, so does f (z) + g(z).
That is, equation (2) has three roots there.
EXAMPLE 2. Rouché’s theorem can be used to give another proof of the
fundamental theorem of algebra (Theorem 2, Sec. 53). To give the detals here, we
consider a polynomial
(3)

P (z) = a0 + a1 z + a2 z2 + · · · + an zn

(an = 0)

of degree n (n ≥ 1) and show that it has n zeros, counting multiplicities. We write
f (z) = an zn ,

g(z) = a0 + a1 z + a2 z2 + · · · + an−1 zn−1

and let z be any point on a circle |z| = R, where R > 1. When such a point is
taken, we see that
|f (z)| = |an |R n .
Also,
|g(z)| ≤ |a0 | + |a1 |R + |a2 |R 2 + · · · + |an−1 |R n−1 .
Consequently, since R > 1,
|g(z)| ≤ |a0 |R n−1 + |a1 |R n−1 + |a2 |R n−1 + · · · + |an−1 |R n−1 ;
and it follows that
|a0 | + |a1 | + |a2 | + · · · + |an−1 |
|g(z)|
≤

|f (z)|
|an |R
if, in addition to being greater than unity,
(4)

R>

|a0 | + |a1 | + |a2 | + · · · + |an−1 |
.
|an |

That is, |f (z)| > |g(z)| when R > 1 and inequality (4) is satisfied. Rouché’s theorem
then tells us that f (z) and f (z) + g(z) have the same number of zeros, namely
n, inside C. Hence we may conclude that P (z) has precisely n zeros, counting
multiplicities, in the plane.
Note how Liouville’s theorem in Sec. 53 only ensured the existence of at least
one zero of a polynomial; but Rouché’s theorem actually ensures the existence of
n zeros, counting multiplicities.

there must be a neighborhood of z0 throughout which f (z) is identically equal to zero.

integral.
It can be shown that when fairly general conditions are imposed on the functions
involved, f (t) is the inverse Laplace transform of F (s). That is, if F (s) is the
Laplace transform of f (t), defined by means of the equation
(3)

F (s) =

 ∞

e−st f (t) dt,

0

then f (t) is retrieved by means of equation (2), where the choice of the positive
number γ is immaterial as long as the singularities of F all lie to the left of LR .∗
Laplace transforms and their inverses are important in solving both ordinary and
partial differential equations.
Residues can often be used to evaluate the limit in expression (1) when the
function F (s) is specified. To see how this is done, we let sn (n = 1, 2, . . . , N )
denote the singularities of F (s). We then let R0 denote the largest of their moduli
and consider a semicircle CR with parametric representation

tional Mathematics,” 3d ed., 1972, where transforms F (s) with an infinite number of isolated singular
points, or with branch cuts, are also discussed.

the function F (s) is analytic for all values of s in the finite plane except for an
infinite set of isolated singular points sn (n = 1, 2, . . .) that lie to the left of some
vertical line Re s = γ . Often the method just described for finding f (t) can then be
modified in such a way that the finite sum (9) is replaced by an infinite series of
residues:
f (t) =

(10)

∞

n=1

Res [est F (s)]

s=sn

(t > 0).

The basic modification is to replace the vertical line segments LR by vertical line
segments LN (N = 1, 2, . . .) from s = γ − ibN to s = γ + ibN . The circular arcs
CR are then replaced by contours CN (N = 1, 2, . . .) from γ + ibN to γ − ibN
such that, for each N , the sum LN + CN is a simple closed contour enclosing the
singular points s1 , s2 , . . . , sN . Once it is shown that

lim
(11)
est F (s) ds = 0,
N →∞ C
N

expression (2) for f (t) becomes expression (10).
The choice of the contours CN depends on the nature of the function F (s).
Common choices include circular or parabolic arcs and rectangular paths. Also, the
simple closed contour LN + CN need not enclose precisely N singularities. When,
for example, the region between LN + CN and LN +1 + CN +1 contains two singular
points of F (s), the pair of corresponding residues of est F (s) are simply grouped
together as a single term in series (10). Since it is often quite tedious to establish
limit (11) in any case, we shall accept it in the examples and related exercises that
involve an infinite number of singularities.∗ Thus our use of expression (10) will
be only formal.

89. EXAMPLES
Calculation of the sums of the residues of est F (s) in expressions (9) and (10),
Sec. 88, is often facilitated by techniques developed in Exercises 12 and 13 of this
section. We preface our examples here with a statement of those techniques.
Suppose that F (s) has a pole of order m at a point s0 and that its Laurent series
representation in a punctured disk 0 < |s − s0 | < R2 has principal part

∗ An extensive treatment of ways to obtain limit (11) appears in the book by R. V. Churchill that is

cited in the footnote earlier in this section. In fact, the inverse transform to be found in Example 3
in the next section is fully verified on pp. 220–226 of that book.

The residues of F (s) at the points sn (n = 1, 2, . . .) are readily found by applying the method of Theorem 2 in Sec. 76 for identifying simple poles and determining

where s 1/2 denotes any branch of this double-valued function. We agree, however,
to use the same branch in the numerator and denominator, so that
(13)

F (s) =

x + x 3 s/6 + · · ·
=
s[s 1/2 + (s 1/2 )3 /3! + · · ·]
s + s 2 /6 + · · ·

when s is not a singular point of F (s). One such singular point is clearly s = 0. With
the additional agreement that the branch cut of s 1/2 does not lie along the negative
real axis, so that sinh(s 1/2 ) is well defined along that axis, the other singular points
occur if s 1/2 = ±nπi (n = 1, 2, . . .). The points
s0 = 0

and

sn = −n2 π 2

(n = 1, 2, . . .)

thus constitute the set of singular points of F (s). The problem is now to evaluate

The geometric interpretation of a function of a complex variable as a mapping, or
transformation, was introduced in Secs. 13 and 14 (Chap. 2). We saw there how
the nature of such a function can be displayed graphically, to some extent, by the
manner in which it maps certain curves and regions.
In this chapter, we shall see further examples of how various curves and regions
are mapped by elementary analytic functions. Applications of such results to physical
problems are illustrated in Chaps. 10 and 11.

90. LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
To study the mapping
(1)

w = Az ,

where A is a nonzero complex constant and z = 0, we write A and z in exponential
form:
A = aeiα , z = reiθ .
Then
(2)

w = (ar)ei(α+θ) ,

and we see from equation (2) that transformation (1) expands or contracts the radius
vector representing z by the factor a and rotates it through the angle α about the
origin. The image of a given region is, therefore, geometrically similar to that region.

The mapping
w = z + B,

(3)

where B is any complex constant, is a translation by means of the vector representing
B. That is, if
w = u + iv,

z = x + iy,

and B = b1 + ib2 ,

then the image of any point (x, y) in the z plane is the point
(u, v) = (x + b1 , y + b2 )

(4)

in the w plane. Since each point in any given region of the z plane is mapped
into the w plane in this manner, the image region is geometrically congruent to the
original one.
The general (nonconstant) linear transformation
w = Az + B

(5)

(A = 0)

is a composition of the transformations
Z = Az (A = 0)

and

w = Z + B.

When z = 0, it is evidently an expansion or contraction and a rotation, followed by
a translation.
EXAMPLE. The mapping
w = (1 + i)z + 2

(6)

transforms the rectangular region in the z = (x, y) plane of Fig. 109 into the rectangular region shown in the w = (u, v) plane there. This is seen by expressing it
as a composition of the transformations

Z = (1 + i)z

1. State why the transformation w = iz is a rotation in the z plane through the angle

Ans. 0 < v < 1.

91. THE TRANSFORMATION w = 1/z
The equation

w=

z

establishes a one to one correspondence between the nonzero points of the z and the
w planes. Since zz = |z|2 , the mapping can be described by means of the successive
transformations

The first of these transformations is an inversion with respect to the unit circle
|z| = 1. That is, the image of a nonzero point z is the point Z with the properties
|Z| =

1
|z|

and

arg Z = arg z.

Thus the points exterior to the circle |z| = 1 are mapped onto the nonzero points
interior to it (Fig. 110), and conversely. Any point on the circle is mapped onto
itself. The second of transformations (2) is simply a reflection in the real axis.

If we write transformation (1) as

we can define T at the origin and at the point at infinity so as to be continuous on
the extended complex plane. To do this, we need only refer to Sec. 17 to see that

In order to make T continuous on the extended plane, then, we write

that the limit

(7)

T (0) = ∞,

T (∞) = 0,

and T (z) =

lim T (z) = T (z0 ),

z→z0

which is clearly true when z0 = 0 and when z0 = ∞, is also true for those two
values of z0 . The fact that T is continuous everywhere in the extended plane is now
a consequence of limit (7). (See Sec. 18.) Because of this continuity, when the point
at infinity is involved in any discussion of the function 1/z, we tacitly assume that
T (z) is intended.

plane under the transformation w = 1/z , writing

The following argument, based on these relations between coordinates, shows that
the mapping w = 1/z transforms circles and lines into circles and lines. When A,
B, C, and D are all real numbers satisfying the condition B 2 + C 2 > 4AD, the
equation
(3)

A(x 2 + y 2 ) + Bx + Cy + D = 0

represents an arbitrary circle or line, where A = 0 for a circle and A = 0 for a
line. The need for the condition B 2 + C 2 > 4AD when A = 0 is evident if, by the
method of completing the squares, we rewrite equation (3) as

2A
When A = 0, the condition becomes B 2 + C 2 > 0, which means that B and C are
not both zero. Returning to the verification of the statement in italics just above, we
observe that if x and y satisfy equation (3), we can use relations (2) to substitute for
those variables. After some simplifications, we find that u and v satisfy the equation
(see also Exercise 14 of this section)
(4)

D(u2 + v 2 ) + Bu − Cv + A = 0,

which also represents a circle or line. Conversely, if u and v satisfy equation (4), it
follows from relations (1) that x and y satisfy equation (3).
It is now clear from equations (3) and (4) that
(a) a circle (A = 0) not passing through the origin (D = 0) in the z plane is transformed into a circle not passing through the origin in the w plane;

(b) a circle (A = 0) through the origin (D = 0) in the z plane is transformed into
a line that does not pass through the origin in the w plane;
(c) a line (A = 0) not passing through the origin (D = 0) in the z plane is transformed into a circle through the origin in the w plane;
(d) a line (A = 0) through the origin (D = 0) in the z plane is transformed into a
line through the origin in the w plane.
EXAMPLE 1. According to equations (3) and (4), a vertical line x = c1
(c1 = 0) is transformed by w = 1/z into the circle −c1 (u2 + v 2 ) + u = 0, or

(u, v) =

If c1 > 0, the circle (5) is evidently to the right of the v axis. As the point
(c1 , y) moves up the entire line, its image traverses the circle once in the clockwise
direction, the point at infinity in the extended z plane corresponding to the origin
in the w plane. This is illustrated in Fig. 111 when c1 = 1/3. Note that v > 0 if
y < 0 ; and as y increases through negative values to 0, one can see that u increases
from 0 to 1/c1 . Then, as y increases through positive values, v is negative and u
decreases to 0.
If, on the other hand, c1 < 0, the circle lies to the left of the v axis. As the point
(c1 , y) moves upward, its image still makes one cycle, but in the counterclockwise
direction. See Fig. 111, where the case c1 = −1/2 is also shown.

93. LINEAR FRACTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS
The transformation
w=

(1)

az + b
cz + d

(ad − bc = 0),

where a, b, c, and d are complex constants, is called a linear fractional transformation, or Möbius transformation. Observe that equation (1) can be written in the
form
(2)

Azw + Bz + Cw + D = 0

(AD − BC = 0);

and, conversely, any equation of type (2) can be put in the form (1). Since this
alternative form is linear in z and linear in w, another name for a linear fractional
transformation is bilinear transformation.
When c = 0, the condition ad − bc = 0 with equation (1) becomes ad = 0 ;
and we see that the transformation reduces to a nonconstant linear function. When
c = 0, equation (1) can be written
(3)

w=

a
bc − ad
1
+
·
c

cz + d

(ad − bc = 0).

So, once again, the condition ad − bc = 0 ensures that we do not have a constant
function. The transformation w = 1/z is evidently a special case of transformation
(1) when c = 0.
Equation (3) reveals that when c = 0, a linear fractional transformation is a
composition of the mappings.
Z = cz + d,

W =

1

Z

w=

(ad − bc = 0).

It thus follows that, regardless of whether c is zero or nonzero, any linear fractional transformation transforms circles and lines into circles and lines because
these special linear fractional transformations do. (See Secs. 90 and 92.)
Solving equation (1) for z, we find that
(4)

z=

−dw + b

(ad − bc = 0).

When a given point w is the image of some point z under transformation (1), the
point z is retrieved by means of equation (4). If c = 0, so that a and d are both
nonzero, each point in the w plane is evidently the image of one and only one
point in the z plane. The same is true if c = 0, except when w = a/c since the
denominator in equation (4) vanishes if w has that value. We can, however, enlarge
the domain of definition of transformation (1) in order to define a linear fractional
transformation T on the extended z plane such that the point w = a/c is the image
of z = ∞ when c = 0. We first write
T (z) =

(5)

az + b
cz + d

(ad − bc = 0).

We then write
T (∞) = ∞

and

T (∞) =

if

In view of Exercise 11, Sec. 18, this makes T continuous on the extended z plane.
It also agrees with the way in which we enlarged the domain of definition of the
transformation w = 1/z in Sec. 91.
When its domain of definition is enlarged in this way, the linear fractional
transformation (5) is a one to one mapping of the extended z plane onto the extended
w plane. That is, T (z1 ) = T (z2 ) whenever z1 = z2 ; and, for each point w in the
second plane, there is a point z in the first one such that T (z) = w. Hence, associated
with the transformation T , there is an inverse transformation T −1 , which is defined
on the extended w plane as follows:
T −1 (w) = z

if and only if

T (z) = w.

From equation (4), we see that
T −1 (w) =

(8)

−dw + b
cw − a

(ad − bc = 0).

Evidently, T −1 is itself a linear fractional transformation, where
T −1 (∞) = ∞

If T and S are two linear fractional transformations, then so is the composition
S[T (z)]. This can be verified by combining expressions of the type (5). Note that,
in particular, T −1 [T (z)] = z for each point z in the extended plane.

Linear Fractional Transformations

321

There is always a linear fractional transformation that maps three given distinct
points z1 , z2 , and z3 onto three specified distinct points w1 , w2 , and w3 , respectively.
Verification of this will appear in Sec. 94, where the image w of a point z under
such a transformation is given implicitly in terms of z. We illustrate here a more
direct approach to finding the desired transformation.
EXAMPLE 1.
the points

Let us find the special case of transformation (1) that maps
z1 = −1,

z2 = 0,

and z3 = 1

w1 = −i,

w2 = 1,

and w3 = i.

onto the points
Since 1 is the image of 0, expression (1) tells us that 1 = b/d, or d = b. Thus
w=

(11)

az + b
cz + b

[b(a − c) = 0].

Then, since −1 and 1 are transformed into −i and i, respectively, it follows that
ic − ib = −a + b

and ic + ib = a + b.

Adding corresponding sides of these equations, we find that c = −ib ; and subtraction reveals that a = ib. Consequently,
w=

b(iz + 1)
ibz + b
=
.
−ibz + b
b(−iz + 1)

We can cancel out the nonzero number b in this last fraction and write
iz + 1
.
w=
−iz + 1
This is, of course, the same as
w=

(12)

i−z
,
i+z

which is obtained by assigning the value i to the arbitrary number b.
EXAMPLE 2.

Suppose that the points
z1 = 1,

z2 = 0,

and z3 = −1

w1 = i,

w2 = ∞,

and w3 = 1.

are to be mapped onto

Since w2 = ∞ corresponds to z2 = 0, we know from equations (6) and (7) that
c = 0 and d = 0 in equation (1). Hence
(13)

w=

az + b

(bc = 0).

Then, because 1 is to be mapped onto i and −1 onto 1, we have the relations
ic = a + b,

−c = −a + b ;

2a = (1 + i)c,

2b = (i − 1)c.

and it follows that

Finally, if we multiply numerator and denominator in the quotient (13) by 2 , make
these substitutions for 2a and 2b, and then cancel out the nonzero number c, we
arrive at
(i + 1)z + (i − 1)

94. AN IMPLICIT FORM
The equation
(1)

(w − w1 )(w2 − w3 )
(z − z1 )(z2 − z3 )
=
(w − w3 )(w2 − w1 )
(z − z3 )(z2 − z1 )

defines (implicitly) a linear fractional transformation that maps distinct points z1 ,
z2 , and z3 in the finite z plane onto distinct points w1 , w2 , and w3 , respectively, in
the finite w plane.∗ To verify this, we write equation (1) as
(2) (z − z3 )(w−w1 )(z2 − z1 )(w2 − w3 ) = (z − z1 )(w − w3 )(z2 − z3 )(w2 −w1 ).
If z = z1 , the right-hand side of equation (2) is zero ; and it follows that w = w1 .
Similarly, if z = z3 , the left-hand side is zero and, consequently, w = w3 . If z = z2 ,
we have the linear equation
(w − w1 )(w2 − w3 ) = (w − w3 )(w2 − w1 ),
whose unique solution is w = w2 . One can see that the mapping defined by
equation (1) is actually a linear fractional transformation by expanding the products
in equation (2) and writing the result in the form (Sec. 93)
(3)

Azw + Bz + Cw + D = 0.

The condition AD − BC = 0, which is needed with equation (3), is clearly satisfied
since, as just demonstrated, equation (1) does not define a constant function. It is
left to the reader (Exercise 10) to show that equation (1) defines the only linear
fractional transformation mapping the points z1 , z2 , and z3 onto w1 , w2 , and w3 ,
respectively.
∗ The two sides of equation (1) are cross ratios, which play an important role in more extensive

developments of linear fractional transformations than in this book. See, for instance, R. P. Boas,
“Invitation to Complex Analysis,” pp. 192–196, 1993 or J. B. Conway, “Functions of One Complex
Variable,” 2d ed., 6th printing, pp. 48–55, 1997.

An Implicit Form

323

The transformation found in Example 1, Sec. 93, required that

z1 = −1, z2 = 0, z3 = 1

and

w1 = −i, w2 = 1, w3 = i.

Using equation (1) to write
(z + 1)(0 − 1)
(w + i)(1 − i)
=
(w − i)(1 + i)
(z − 1)(0 + 1)
and then solving for w in terms of z, we arrive at the transformation
w=

i+z

found earlier.
If equation (1) is modified properly, it can also be used when the point at infinity
is one of the prescribed points in either the (extended) z or w plane. Suppose, for
instance, that z1 = ∞. Since any linear fractional transformation is continuous on
the extended plane, we need only replace z1 on the right-hand side of equation (1)
by 1/z1 , clear fractions, and let z1 tend to zero :
(z − 1/z1 )(z2 − z3 ) z1
(z1 z − 1)(z2 − z3 )
z2 − z3
·
=
= lim
.
z1 →0 (z − z3 )(z2 − 1/z1 ) z1
z1 →0 (z − z3 )(z1 z2 − 1)

The desired modification of equation (1) is, then,
z2 − z3
(w − w1 )(w2 − w3 )
.
=
(w − w3 )(w2 − w1 )
z − z3
Note that this modification is obtained formally by simply deleting the factors involving z1 in equation (1). It is easy to check that the same formal approach applies
when any of the other prescribed points is ∞.
EXAMPLE 2.

In Example 2, Sec. 93, the prescribed points were

z1 = 1, z2 = 0, z3 = −1

and

w1 = i, w2 = ∞, w3 = 1.

In this case, we use the modification
w − w1
(z − z1 )(z2 − z3 )
=
w − w3
(z − z3 )(z2 − z1 )
of equation (1), which tells us that

95. MAPPINGS OF THE UPPER HALF PLANE
Let us determine all linear fractional transformations that map the upper half plane
Im z > 0 onto the open disk |w| < 1 and the boundary Im z = 0 of the half plane
onto the boundary |w| = 1 of the disk (Fig. 113).

We note from equation (1) that if |w| = 1 when z = 0, then |b/d| = 1; that is,
|b| = |d| = 0.

(2)

Furthermore, statements (6) and (7) in Sec. 93 tell use that the image of the point
z = ∞ is a finite number only if c = 0, that finite number being w = a/c. So the
requirement that |w| = 1 when z = ∞ means that |a/c| = 1, or
|a| = |c| = 0 ;

(3)

and the fact that a and c are nonzero enables us to rewrite equation (1) as
w=

Then, since |a/c| = 1 and

z − z0
(|z1 | = |z0 | = 0),
(5)
w = eiα
z − z1
where α is a real constant and z0 and z1 are (nonzero) complex constants.
Next, we impose on transformation (5) the condition that |w| = 1 when z = 1.
This tells us that
|1 − z1 | = |1 − z0 |,
or
(1 − z1 )(1 − z1 ) = (1 − z0 )(1 − z0 ).
But z1 z1 = z0 z0 since |z1 | = |z0 |, and the above relation reduces to
z1 + z1 = z0 + z0 ;
that is, Re z1 = Re z0 . It follows that either
z1 = z0

or

z1 = z0 ,

again since |z1 | = |z0 |. If z1 = z0 , transformation (5) becomes the constant function
w = exp(iα); hence z1 = z0 .
Transformation (5), with z1 = z0 , maps the point z0 onto the origin w = 0 ;
and, since points interior to the circle |w| = 1 are to be the images of points above
the real axis in the z plane, we may conclude that Im z0 > 0. Any linear fractional
transformation having the mapping property stated in the first paragraph of this
section must, therefore, be of the form

where α is real.
It remains to show that, conversely, any linear fractional transformation of the
form (6) has the desired mapping property. This is easily done by taking the modulus
of each side of equation (6) and interpreting the resulting equation,
|z − z0 |
,
|z − z0 |
geometrically. If a point z lies above the real axis, both it and the point z0 lie on
the same side of that axis, which is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment
joining z0 and z0 . It follows that the distance |z − z0 | is less than the distance
|z − z0 | (Fig. 113); that is, |w| < 1. Likewise, if z lies below the real axis, the
distance |z − z0 | is greater than the distance |z − z0 |; and so |w| > 1. Finally, if z is
on the real axis, |w| = 1 because then |z − z0 | = |z − z0 |. Since any linear fractional
transformation is a one to one mapping of the extended z plane onto the extended
w plane, this shows that transformation (6) maps the half plane Im z > 0 onto the
disk |w| < 1 and the boundary of the half plane onto the boundary of the disk.
Our first example here illustrates the use of the result in italics just above.

Images of the upper half plane Im z ≥ 0 under other types of linear fractional
transformations are often fairly easy to determine by examining the particular transformation in question.

that the transformation
z−1
w=
(8)
z+1
maps the half plane y > 0 onto the half plane v > 0 and the x axis onto the u axis.
We first note that when the number z is real, so is the number w. Consequently,
since the image of the real axis y = 0 is either a circle or a line, it must be the real
axis v = 0. Furthermore, for any point w in the finite w plane,
v = Im w = Im

The numbers y and v thus have the same sign, and this means that points above the
x axis correspond to points above the u axis and points below the x axis correspond
to points below the u axis. Finally, since points on the x axis correspond to points
on the u axis and since a linear fractional transformation is a one to one mapping of
the extended plane onto the extended plane (Sec. 93), the stated mapping property
of transformation (8) is established.
Our final example involves a composite function and uses the mapping discussed in Example 2.

and w = Log Z.

According to Example 2, the first of transformations (10) maps the upper half
plane y > 0 onto the upper half plane Y > 0, where z = x + iy and Z = X + iY .
Furthermore, it is easy to see from Fig. 114 that the second of transformations
(10) maps the half plane Y > 0 onto the strip 0 < v < π, where w = u + iv. More
precisely, by writing Z = R exp(i) and
Log Z = ln R + i

(R > 0, −π <  < π),

we see that as a point Z = R exp(i0 ) (0 < 0 < π) moves outward from the origin
along the ray  = 0 , its image is the point whose rectangular coordinates in the
w plane are (ln R, 0 ). That image evidently moves to the right along the entire
length of the horizontal line v = 0 . Since these lines fill the strip 0 < v < π as

the choice of 0 varies between 0 = 0 to 0 = π, the mapping of the half plane
Y > 0 onto the strip is, in fact, one to one.

Since (Sec. 34)
sin z = sin x cosh y + i cos x sinh y,
the transformation w = sin z can be written
(1)

u = sin x cosh y,

v = cos x sinh y.

One method that is often useful in finding images of regions under this transformation is to examine images of vertical lines x = c1 . If 0 < c1 < π/2, points on
the line x = c1 are transformed into points on the curve

hyperbola’s branch. Such a line and its image are shown in Fig. 116, where corresponding points are labeled. Note that, in particular, there is a one to one mapping
of the top half (y > 0) of the line onto the top half (v > 0) of the hyperbola’s
branch. If −π/2 < c1 < 0, the line x = c1 is mapped onto the left-hand branch of
the same hyperbola. As before, corresponding points are indicated in Fig. 116.

The line x = 0, or the y axis, needs to be considered separately. According
to equations (1), the image of each point (0, y) is (0, sinh y). Hence the y axis is
mapped onto the v axis in a one to one manner, the positive y axis corresponding
to the positive v axis.
We now illustrate how these observations can be used to establish the images
of certain regions.
EXAMPLE 1. Here we show that the transformation w = sin z is a one to
one mapping of the semi-infinite strip −π/2 ≤ x ≤ π/2, y ≥ 0 in the z plane onto
the upper half v ≥ 0 of the w plane.
To do this, we first show that the boundary of the strip is mapped in a one
to one manner onto the real axis in the w plane, as indicated in Fig. 117. The
image of the line segment BA there is found by writing x = π/2 in equations (1)

4:29pm

and restricting y to be nonnegative. Since u = cosh y and v = 0 when x = π/2, a
typical point (π/2, y) on BA is mapped onto the point (cosh y, 0) in the w plane;
and that image must move to the right from B  along the u axis as (π/2, y) moves
upward from B. A point (x, 0) on the horizontal segment DB has image (sin x, 0),
which moves to the right from D  to B  as x increases from x = −π/2 to x = π/2 ,
or as (x, 0) goes from D to B. Finally, as a point (−π/2, y) on the line segment
DE moves upward from D, its image (−coshy, 0) moves to the left from D  .

Now each point in the interior −π/2 < x < π/2, y > 0 of the strip lies on
one of the vertical half lines x = c1 , y > 0 (−π/2 < c1 < π/2) that are shown in
Fig. 117. Also, it is important to notice that the images of those half lines are distinct
and constitute the entire half plane v > 0. More precisely, if the upper half L of a
line x = c1 (0 < c1 < π/2) is thought of as moving to the left toward the positive
y axis, the right-hand branch of the hyperbola containing its image L is opening up
wider and its vertex (sin c1 , 0) is tending toward the origin w = 0. Hence L tends
to become the positive v axis, which we saw just prior to this example is the image
of the positive y axis. On the other hand, as L approaches the segment BA of the
boundary of the strip, the branch of the hyperbola closes down around the segment
B  A of the u axis and its vertex (sin c1 , 0) tends toward the point w = 1. Similar
statements can be made regarding the half line M and its image M  in Fig. 117.
We may conclude that the image of each point in the interior of the strip lies in
the upper half plane v > 0 and, furthermore, that each point in the half plane is the
image of exactly one point in the interior of the strip.
This completes our demonstration that the transformation w = sin z is a one
to one mapping of the strip −π/2 ≤ x ≤ π/2, y ≥ 0 onto the half plane v ≥ 0.
The final result is shown in Fig. 9, Appendix 2. The right-hand half of the strip
is evidently mapped onto the first quadrant of the w plane, as shown in Fig. 10,
Appendix 2.
Another convenient way to find the images of certain regions when w = sin z
is to consider the images of horizontal line segments y = c2 (−π ≤ x ≤ π), where
c2 > 0. According to equations (1), the image of such a line segment is the curve
with parametric representation

The image of a point (x, c2 ) moving to the right from point A to point E in
Fig. 118 makes one circuit around the ellipse in the clockwise direction. Note that
when smaller values of the positive number c2 are taken, the ellipse becomes smaller
but retains the same foci (±1, 0). In the limiting case c2 = 0, equations (4) become
u = sin x,

v=0

(−π ≤ x ≤ π);

and we find that the interval −π ≤ x ≤ π of the x axis is mapped onto the interval
−1 ≤ u ≤ 1 of the u axis. The mapping is not, however, one to one, as it is when
c2 > 0.
The next example relies on these remarks.

line segment y = c2 (−π/2 ≤ x ≤ π/2), where 0 < c2 ≤ b, its image L is the top
half of the ellipse (5). As c2 decreases, L moves downward toward the x axis and the
semi-ellipse L also moves downward and tends to become the line segment E  F  A

and this is clearly a one to one mapping of the segment EF A onto E  F  A . Inasmuch
as any point in the semi-elliptical region in the w plane lies on one and only one of
the semi-ellipses, or on the limiting case E  F  A , that point is the image of exactly
one point in the rectangular region in the z plane. The desired mapping, which is
also shown in Fig. 11 of Appendix 2, is now established.
Mappings by various other functions closely related to the sine function are
easily obtained once mappings by the sine function are known.
EXAMPLE 3.

One need only recall the identity (Sec. 34)

π
cos z = sin z +
2

to see that the transformation w = cos z can be written successively as
π
Z = z + , w = sin Z.

Hence the cosine transformation is the same as the sine transformation preceded by
a translation to the right through π/2 units.
EXAMPLE 4. According to Sec. 35, the transformation w = sinh z can be
written w = −i sin(iz), or
Z = iz,

W = sin Z,

w = −iW.

It is, therefore, a combination of the sine transformation and rotations through right
angles. The transformation w = cosh z is, likewise, essentially a cosine transformation since cosh z = cos(iz).

upper halves, respectively, of the branch.
3. Vertical half lines were used in Example 1, Sec. 96, to show that the transformation

a different way in Example 1, Sec. 96, and in Exercise 3.)

97. MAPPINGS BY z 2 AND BRANCHES OF z 1/2
In Chap 2 (Sec. 13), we considered some fairly simple mappings under the transformation w = z2 , written in the form
u = x2 − y2,

v = 2xy.

We turn now to a less elementary example and then examine related mappings
w = z1/2 , where specific branches of the square root function are taken.
EXAMPLE 1. Let us use equations (1) to show that the image of the vertical strip 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, y ≥ 0, shown in Fig. 122, is the closed semiparabolic region
indicated there.

When 0 < x1 < 1, the point (x1 , y) moves up a vertical half line, labeled L1
in Fig. 122, as y increases from y = 0. The image traced out in the uv plane has,
according to equations (1), the parametric representation
(2)

u = x12 − y 2 ,

v = 2x1 y

(0 ≤ y < ∞).

Using the second of these equations to substitute for y in the first one, we see that
the image points (u, v) must lie on the parabola
v 2 = −4x12 (u − x12 ),

(3)

with vertex at (x12 , 0) and focus at the origin. Since v increases with y from v = 0,
according to the second of equations (2), we also see that as the point (x1 , y) moves
up L1 from the x axis, its image moves up the top half L1 of the parabola from the
u axis. Furthermore, when a number x2 larger than x1 but less than 1 is taken, the
corresponding half line L2 has an image L2 that is a half parabola to the right of
L1 , as indicated in Fig. 122. We note, in fact, that the image of the half line BA in
that figure is the top half of the parabola v 2 = −4(u − 1), labeled B  A .
The image of the half line CD is found by observing from equations (1) that a
typical point (0, y), where y ≥ 0, on CD is transformed into the point (−y 2 , 0) in
the uv plane. So, as a point moves up from the origin along CD, its image moves
left from the origin along the u axis. Evidently, then, as the vertical half lines in the
xy plane move to the left, the half parabolas that are their images in the uv plane
shrink down to become the half line C  D  .
It is now clear that the images of all the half lines between and including CD
and BA fill up the closed semiparabolic region bounded by A B  C  D  . Also, each
point in that region is the image of only one point in the closed strip bounded by
ABCD. Hence we may conclude that the semiparabolic region is the image of the
strip and that there is a one to one correspondence between points in those closed
regions. (Compare with Fig. 3 in Appendix 2, where the strip has arbitrary width.)
As for mappings by branches of z1/2 , we recall from Sec. 9 that the values of
z1/2 are the two square roots of z when z = 0. According to that section, if polar
coordinates are used and
z = r exp(i)

(r > 0, −π <  ≤ π),

then

z1/2 =

The principal branch F0 (z) of the double-valued function z1/2 is then obtained by
taking the principal branch of log z and writing (see Sec. 33)

The right-hand side of this equation is, of course, the same as the right-hand side
of equation (4) when k = 0 and −π <  < π there. The origin and the ray  = π
form the branch cut for F0 , and the origin is the branch point.
Images of curves and regions under the transformation

EXAMPLE 2. It is easy to verify that w = F0 (z) is a one to
√one mapping of
the quarter disk 0 ≤ r ≤ 2, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 onto the sector 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 2, 0 ≤ φ ≤ π/4
in the w plane (Fig. 123). To do this, we observe that as a point z = r exp(iθ1 )
moves outward from the origin along a radius√R1 of length 2 and with angle of
inclination θ1 (0 ≤ θ1 ≤ π/2), its image w = r exp(iθ1 /2) moves
√ outward from
the origin in the w plane along a radius R1 whose length is 2 and angle of
inclination is θ1 /2. See Fig. 123, where another radius R2 and its image R2 are also
shown. It is now clear from the figure that if the region in the z plane is thought
of as being swept out by a radius, starting with DA and ending with DC, then the
region in the w plane is swept out by the corresponding radius, starting with D  A
and ending with D  C  . This establishes a one to one correspondence between points
in the two regions.

The transformation w = F0 (sin z) can be written

Z = sin z,

(|Z| > 0, −π < Arg Z < π).

w = F0 (Z)

From a remark at the end of Example 1 in Sec. 96, we know that the first transformation maps the semi-infinite strip 0 ≤ x ≤ π/2, y ≥ 0 onto the first quadrant
of the Z plane. The second transformation, with the understanding that F0 (0) = 0,
maps that quadrant onto an octant in the w plane. These successive transformations
are illustrated in Fig. 124, where corresponding boundary points are shown.

When −π <  < π and the branch

of the logarithmic function is used, equation (5) yields the branch

F1 (z) =

√
i( + 2π)
r exp

(r > 0, −π <  < π)

of z1/2 , which corresponds to k = 1 in equation (4). Since exp(iπ) = −1, it follows
that F1 (z) = −F0 (z). The values ±F0 (z) thus represent the totality of values of z1/2
at all points in the domain r > 0, −π <  < π . If, by means of expression (6), we
extend the domain of definition of F0 to include the ray  = π and if we write
F0 (0) = 0, then the values ±F0 (z) represent the totality of values of z1/2 in the
entire z plane.
Other branches of z1/2 are obtained by using other branches of log z in expression (5). A branch where the ray θ = α is used to form the branch cut is given by
the equation
(8)

fα (z) =

√
iθ
r exp

(r > 0, α < θ < α + 2π).

Observe that when α = −π, we have the branch F0 (z) and that when α = π, we
have the branch F1 (z). Just as in the case of F0 , the domain of definition of fα can
be extended to the entire complex plane by using expression (8) to define fα at the
nonzero points on the branch cut and by writing fα (0) = 0. Such extensions are,
however, never continuous on the entire complex plane.

Finally, suppose that n is any positive integer, where n ≥ 2. The values of z1/n

EXERCISES
1. Show, indicating corresponding orientations, that the mapping w = z2 transforms horizontal lines y = y1 (y1 > 0) into parabolas v 2 = 4y12 (u + y12 ), all with foci at the
origin w = 0. (Compare with Example 1, Sec. 97.)
2. Use the result in Exercise 1 to show that the transformation w = z2 is a one to one
mapping of a horizontal strip a ≤ y ≤ b above the x axis onto the closed region
between the two parabolas
v 2 = 4a 2 (u + a 2 ),

v 2 = 4b2 (u + b2 ).

3. Point out how it follows from the discussion in Example 1, Sec. 97, that the transformation w = z2 maps a vertical strip 0 ≤ x ≤ c, y ≥ 0 of arbitrary width onto a closed
semiparabolic region, as shown in Fig. 3, Appendix 2.
4. Modify the discussion in Example 1, Sec. 97, to show that when w = z2 , the image
of the closed triangular region formed by the lines y = ±x and x = 1 is the closed
parabolic region bounded on the left by the segment −2 ≤ v ≤ 2 of the v axis and
on the right by a portion of the parabola v 2 = −4(u − 1). Verify the corresponding
points on the two boundaries shown in Fig. 125.
5. By referring to Fig. 10, Appendix 2, show that the transformation w = sin2 z maps
the strip 0 ≤ x ≤ π/2, y ≥ 0 onto the half plane v ≥ 0. Indicate corresponding parts
of the boundaries.
Suggestion: See also the first paragraph in Example 3, Sec. 13.

the fourth roots of i.

98. SQUARE ROOTS OF POLYNOMIALS
We now consider some mappings that are compositions of polynomials and square
roots.
EXAMPLE 1. Branches of the double-valued function (z − z0 )1/2 can be
obtained by noting that it is a composition of the translation Z = z − z0 with the

double-valued function Z 1/2 . Each branch of Z 1/2 yields a branch of (z − z0 )1/2 .
More precisely, when Z = Reiθ , branches of Z 1/2 are
√
iθ
Z 1/2 = R exp
(R > 0, α < θ < α + 2π),
2
according to equation (8) in Sec. 97. Hence if we write
R = |z − z0 |,

 = Arg (z − z0 ),

two branches of (z − z0 )1/2 are
√
i
G0 (z) = R exp

(2)
g0 (z) = R exp

and θ = arg(z − z0 ),

(R > 0, −π <  < π)

(R > 0, 0 < θ < 2π).

The branch of Z 1/2 that was used in writing G0 (z) is defined at all points in the
Z plane except for the origin and points on the ray Arg Z = π. The transformation
w = G0 (z) is, therefore, a one to one mapping of the domain
|z − z0 | > 0,

−π < Arg (z − z0 ) < π

onto the right half Re w > 0 of the w plane (Fig. 126). The transformation w = g0 (z)
maps the domain
|z − z0 | > 0, 0 < arg(z − z0 ) < 2π
in a one to one manner onto the upper half plane Im w > 0.

or
(z2 − 1)1/2 = (z − 1)1/2 (z + 1)1/2

(3)

(z = ±1).

Consequently, if f1 (z) is a branch of (z − 1)1/2 defined on a domain D1 and f2 (z)
is a branch of (z + 1)1/2 defined on a domain D2 , the product f (z) = f1 (z)f2 (z) is
a branch of (z2 − 1)1/2 defined at all points lying in both D1 and D2 .
In order to obtain a specific branch of (z2 − 1)1/2 , we use the branch of
(z − 1)1/2 and the branch of (z + 1)1/2 given by equation (2). If we write
r1 = |z − 1|

and θ1 = arg(z − 1),

that branch of (z − 1)1/2 is
f1 (z) =

√
iθ1
r1 exp
2

(r1 > 0, 0 < θ1 < 2π).

The branch of (z + 1)1/2 given by equation (2) is
f2 (z) =

√
iθ2
r2 exp
2

(r2 > 0, 0 < θ2 < 2π),

where
r2 = |z + 1|

and θ2 = arg(z + 1).

The product of these two branches is, therefore, the branch f of (z2 − 1)1/2 defined
by means of the equation

where
rk > 0,

0 ≤ θk < 2π

(k = 1, 2)

and

r1 + r2 > 2.

As we shall now see, this function is analytic everywhere in its domain of definition,
which is the entire z plane except for the segment −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 of the x axis.
Since F (z) = f (z) for all z in the domain of definition of F except on the ray
r1 > 0, θ1 = 0, we need only show that F is analytic on that ray. To do this, we
form the product of the branches of (z − 1)1/2 and (z + 1)1/2 which are given by
equation (1). That is, we consider the function
G(z) =

√
i(1 + 2 )
,
r1 r2 exp
2

where
r1 = |z − 1|,

r2 = |z + 1|,

1 = Arg (z − 1),

2 = Arg (z + 1)

and where
rk > 0,

−π < k < π

(k = 1, 2).

Observe that G is analytic in the entire z plane except for the ray r1 ≥ 0, 1 = π.
Now F (z) = G(z) when the point z lies above or on the ray r1 > 0, 1 = 0 ; for
then θk = k (k = 1, 2). When z lies below that ray, θk = k + 2π (k = 1, 2).
Consequently, exp(iθk /2) = −exp(ik /2); and this means that

So again, F (z) = G(z). Since F (z) and G(z) are the same in a domain containing
the ray r1 > 0, 1 = 0 and since G is analytic in that domain, F is analytic there.
Hence F is analytic everywhere except on the line segment P2 P1 in Fig. 127.
The function F defined by equation (5) cannot itself be extended to a function
which is analytic at points on the line segment P2 P1 . This is because the value on
√
√
the right in equation (5) jumps from i r1 r2 to numbers near −i r1 r2 as the point
z moves downward across that line segment, and the extension would not even be
continuous there.
The transformation w = F (z) is, as we shall see, a one to one mapping of the
domain Dz consisting of all points in the z plane except those on the line segment
P2 P1 onto the domain Dw consisting of the entire w plane with the exception of
the segment −1 ≤ v ≤ 1 of the v axis (Fig. 128).
Before verifying this, we note that if z = iy (y > 0), then
r1 = r2 > 1

and θ1 + θ2 = π;

hence the positive y axis is mapped by w = F (z) onto that part of the v axis for
which v > 1. The negative y axis is, moreover, mapped onto that part of the v axis
for which v < −1. Each point in the upper half y > 0 of the domain Dz is mapped
into the upper half v > 0 of the w plane, and each point in the lower half y < 0

of the domain Dz is mapped into the lower half v < 0 of the w plane. Also, the
ray r1 > 0, θ1 = 0 is mapped onto the positive real axis in the w plane, and the ray
r2 > 0, θ2 = π is mapped onto the negative real axis there.
To show that the transformation w = F (z) is one to one, we observe that if
F (z1 ) = F (z2 ), then z12 − 1 = z22 − 1. From this, it follows that z1 = z2 or z1 = −z2 .
However, because of the manner in which F maps the upper and lower halves of the
domain Dz , as well as the portions of the real axis lying in Dz , the case z1 = −z2
is impossible. Thus, if F (z1 ) = F (z2 ), then z1 = z2 ; and F is one to one.
We can show that F maps the domain Dz onto the domain Dw by finding a
function H mapping Dw into Dz with the property that if z = H (w), then w = F (z).
This will show that for any point w in Dw , there exists a point z in Dz such that
F (z) = w; that is, the mapping F is onto. The mapping H will be the inverse of F .
To find H , we first note that if w is a value of (z2 − 1)1/2 for a specific z, then
2
w = z2 − 1; and z is, therefore, a value of (w2 + 1)1/2 for that w. The function H
will be a branch of the double-valued function
(w2 + 1)1/2 = (w − i)1/2 (w + i)1/2

Following our procedure for obtaining the function F (z), we write w − i = ρ1 exp(iφ1 )

Dw lying above or below the u axis onto points above or below the x axis, respectively. It maps the positive u axis into that part of the x axis where x > 1 and the
negative u axis into that part of the negative x axis where x < −1. If z = H (w),
then z2 = w2 + 1; and so w2 = z2 − 1. Since z is in Dz and since F (z) and −F (z)
are the two values of (z2 − 1)1/2 for a point in Dz , we see that w = F (z) or
w = −F (z). But it is evident from the manner in which F and H map the upper

EXERCISES
1. The branch F of (z2 − 1)1/2 in Example 2, Sec. 98, was defined in terms of the coordinates r1 , r2 , θ1 , θ2 . Explain geometrically why the conditions r1 > 0, 0 < θ1 + θ2 < π
describe the first quadrant x > 0, y > 0 of the z plane. Then show that w = F (z)
maps that quadrant onto the first quadrant u > 0, v > 0 of the w plane.
Suggestion: To show that the quadrant x > 0, y > 0 in the z plane is described,
note that θ1 + θ2 = π at each point on the positive y axis and that θ1 + θ2 decreases
as a point z moves to the right along a ray θ2 = c (0 < c < π/2).

3. Show that in Exercise 2 the domain D that lies under the hyperbola and in the first
quadrant of the z plane is described by the conditions r1 > 0, 0 < θ1 + θ2 < π/2.
Then show that the image of D is the octant 0 < v < u. Sketch the domain D and its
image.
4. Let F be the branch of (z2 − 1)1/2 that was defined in Example 2, Sec. 98, and let

that a branch F0 of (z2 − z02 )1/2 whose branch cut is the line segment between the
points z0 and −z0 can be written F0 (z) = z0 F (Z), where Z = z/z0 .

99. RIEMANN SURFACES
The remaining two sections of this chapter constitute a brief introduction to the
concept of a mapping defined on a Riemann surface, which is a generalization of
the complex plane consisting of more than one sheet. The theory rests on the fact
that at each point on such a surface only one value of a given multiple-valued
function is assigned. The material in these two sections will not be used in the
chapters to follow, and the reader may skip to Chap. 9 without disruption.
Once a Riemann surface is devised for a given function, the function is singlevalued on the surface and the theory of single-valued functions applies there.
Complexities arising because the function is multiple-valued are thus relieved by a
geometric device. However, the description of those surfaces and the arrangement
of proper connections between the sheets can become quite involved. We limit our
attention to fairly simple examples and begin with a surface for log z.

has infinitely many values. To describe log z as a single-valued function, we replace
the z plane, with the origin deleted, by a surface on which a new point is located
whenever the argument of the number z is increased or decreased by 2π, or an
integral multiple of 2π.
We treat the z plane, with the origin deleted, as a thin sheet R0 which is cut
along the positive half of the real axis. On that sheet, let θ range from 0 to 2π. Let
a second sheet R1 be cut in the same way and placed in front of the sheet R0 . The
lower edge of the slit in R0 is then joined to the upper edge of the slit in R1 . On
R1 , the angle θ ranges from 2π to 4π; so, when z is represented by a point on R1 ,
the imaginary component of log z ranges from 2π to 4π.
A sheet R2 is then cut in the same way and placed in front of R1 . The lower
edge of the slit in R1 is joined to the upper edge of the slit in this new sheet, and
similarly for sheets R3 , R4 , . . . . A sheet R−1 on which θ varies from 0 to −2π is
cut and placed behind R0 , with the lower edge of its slit connected to the upper
edge of the slit in R0 ; the sheets R−2 , R−3 , . . . are constructed in like manner. The
coordinates r and θ of a point on any sheet can be considered as polar coordinates
of the projection of the point onto the original z plane, the angular coordinate θ
being restricted to a definite range of 2π radians on each sheet.
Consider any continuous curve on this connected surface of infinitely many
sheets. As a point z describes that curve, the values of log z vary continuously
since θ , in addition to r, varies continuously; and log z now assumes just one
value corresponding to each point on the curve. For example, as the point makes a
complete cycle around the origin on the sheet R0 over the path indicated in Fig. 129,
the angle changes from 0 to 2π. As it moves across the ray θ = 2π, the point passes
to the sheet R1 of the surface. As the point completes a cycle in R1 , the angle θ varies
from 2π to 4π; and as it crosses the ray θ = 4π, the point passes to the sheet R2 .

The surface described here is a Riemann surface for log z. It is a connected
surface of infinitely many sheets, arranged so that log z is a single-valued function
of points on it.
The transformation w = log z maps the whole Riemann surface in a one to one
manner onto the entire w plane. The image of the sheet R0 is the strip 0 ≤ v ≤ 2π
(see Example 3, Sec. 95). As a point z moves onto the sheet R1 over the arc shown

in Fig. 130, its image w moves upward across the line v = 2π, as indicated in that
figure.
Note that log z, defined on the sheet R1 , represents the analytic continuation
(Sec. 27) of the single-valued analytic function
f (z) = ln r + iθ

(0 < θ < 2π)

upward across the positive real axis. In this sense, log z is not only a single-valued
function of all points z on the Riemann surface but also an analytic function at all
points there.
The sheets could, of course, be cut along the negative real axis or along any
other ray from the origin, and properly joined along the slits, to form other Riemann
surfaces for log z.
EXAMPLE 2. Corresponding to each point in the z plane other than the
origin, the square root function

has two values. A Riemann surface for z1/2 is obtained by replacing the z plane
with a surface made up of two sheets R0 and R1 , each cut along the positive real
axis and with R1 placed in front of R0 . The lower edge of the slit in R0 is joined
to the upper edge of the slit in R1 , and the lower edge of the slit in R1 is joined to
the upper edge of the slit in R0 .
As a point z starts from the upper edge of the slit in R0 and describes a
continuous circuit around the origin in the counterclockwise direction (Fig. 131),

the angle θ increases from 0 to 2π. The point then passes from the sheet R0 to
the sheet R1 , where θ increases from 2π to 4π. As the point moves still further, it
passes back to the sheet R0 , where the values of θ can vary from 4π to 6π or from
0 to 2π, a choice that does not affect the value of z1/2 , etc. Note that the value of
z1/2 at a point where the circuit passes from the sheet R0 to the sheet R1 is different
from the value of z1/2 at a point where the circuit passes from the sheet R1 to the
sheet R0 .
We have thus constructed a Riemann surface on which z1/2 is single-valued for
each nonzero z. In that construction, the edges of the sheets R0 and R1 are joined
in pairs in such a way that the resulting surface is closed and connected. The points
where two of the edges are joined are distinct from the points where the other two
edges are joined. Thus it is physically impossible to build a model of that Riemann
surface. In visualizing a Riemann surface, it is important to understand how we are
to proceed when we arrive at an edge of a slit.
The origin is a special point on this Riemann surface. It is common to both
sheets, and a curve around the origin on the surface must wind around it twice in
order to be a closed curve. A point of this kind on a Riemann surface is called a
branch point.
The image of the sheet R0 under the transformation w = z1/2 is the upper
half of the w plane since the argument of w is θ/2 on R0 , where 0 ≤ θ/2 ≤ π.
Likewise, the image of the sheet R1 is the lower half of the w plane. As defined on
either sheet, the function is the analytic continuation, across the cut, of the function
defined on the other sheet. In this respect, the single-valued function z1/2 of points
on the Riemann surface is analytic at all points except the origin.

EXERCISES
1. Describe the Riemann surface for log z obtained by cutting the z plane along the
negative real axis. Compare this Riemann surface with the one obtained in Example 1,
Sec. 99.
2. Determine the image under the transformation w = log z of the sheet Rn , where n is
an arbitrary integer, of the Riemann surface for log z given in Example 1, Sec. 99.
3. Verify that under the transformation w = z1/2 , the sheet R1 of the Riemann surface
for z1/2 given in Example 2, Sec. 99, is mapped onto the lower half of the w plane.
4. Describe the curve, on a Riemann surface for z1/2 , whose image is the entire circle
|w| = 1 under the transformation w = z1/2 .
5. Let C denote the positively oriented circle |z − 2| = 1 on the Riemann surface
described in Example 2, Sec. 99, for z1/2 , where the upper half of that circle lies
on the sheet R0 and the lower half on R1 . Note that for each point z on C, one can

Generalize this result to fit the case of the other simple closed curves that cross from
one sheet to another without enclosing the branch points. Generalize to other functions,

100. SURFACES FOR RELATED FUNCTIONS
We consider here Riemann surfaces for two composite functions involving simple
polynomials and the square root function.

the line segment P2 P1 between the branch points z = ±1 serving as a branch cut
(Fig. 132), was described in Example 2, Sec. 98. That branch is as written above,
with the restrictions rk > 0, 0 ≤ θk < 2π (k = 1, 2) and r1 + r2 > 2. The branch is
not defined on the segment P2 P1 .

FIGURE 132

A Riemann surface for the double-valued function (1) must consist of two
sheets R0 and R1 . Let both sheets be cut along the segment P2 P1 . The lower edge
of the slit in R0 is then joined to the upper edge of the slit in R1 , and the lower
edge in R1 is joined to the upper edge in R0 .
On the sheet R0 , let the angles θ1 and θ2 range from 0 to 2π. If a point
on the sheet R0 describes a simple closed curve that encloses the segment P2 P1
once in the counterclockwise direction, then both θ1 and θ2 change by the amount
2π upon the return of the point to its original position. The change in (θ1 + θ2 )/2 is
also 2π, and the value of f is unchanged. If a point starting on the sheet R0 describes
a path that passes twice around just the branch point z = 1, it crosses from the sheet

R0 onto the sheet R1 and then back onto the sheet R0 before it returns to its original
position. In this case, the value of θ1 changes by the amount 4π, while the value
of θ2 does not change at all. Similarly, for a circuit twice around the point z = −1,
the value of θ2 changes by 4π, while the value of θ1 remains unchanged. Again, the
change in (θ1 + θ2 )/2 is 2π; and the value of f is unchanged. Thus, on the sheet R0 ,
the range of the angles θ1 and θ2 may be extended by changing both θ1 and θ2 by
the same integral multiple of 2π or by changing just one of the angles by a multiple
of 4π. In either case, the total change in both angles is an even integral multiple
of 2π.
To obtain the range of values for θ1 and θ2 on the sheet R1 , we note that if
a point starts on the sheet R0 and describes a path around just one of the branch
points once, it crosses onto the sheet R1 and does not return to the sheet R0 . In this
case, the value of one of the angles is changed by 2π, while the value of the other
remains unchanged. Hence, on the sheet R1 , one angle can range from 2π to 4π,
while the other ranges from 0 to 2π. Their sum then ranges from 2π to 4π, and the
value of (θ1 + θ2 )/2, which is the argument of f (z), ranges from π to 2π. Again,
the range of the angles is extended by changing the value of just one of the angles
by an integral multiple of 4π or by changing the value of both angles by the same
integral multiple of 2π.
The double-valued function (1) may now be considered as a single-valued
function of the points on the Riemann surface just constructed. The transformation
w = f (z) maps each of the sheets used in the construction of that surface onto the
entire w plane.

Consider the double-valued function

(Fig. 133). The points z = 0, ±1 are branch points of this function. We note that if
the point z describes a circuit that includes all three of those points, the argument
of f (z) changes by the angle 3π and the value of the function thus changes. Consequently, a branch cut must run from one of those branch points to the point at
infinity in order to describe a single-valued branch of f . Hence the point at infinity
is also a branch point, as one can show by noting that the function f (1/z) has a
branch point at z = 0.

Let two sheets be cut along the line segment L2 from z = −1 to z = 0 and
along the part L1 of the real axis to the right of the point z = 1. We specify that
each of the three angles θ, θ1 , and θ2 may range from 0 to 2π on the sheet R0 and
from 2π to 4π on the sheet R1 . We also specify that the angles corresponding to
a point on either sheet may be changed by integral multiples of 2π in such a way
that the sum of the three angles changes by an integral multiple of 4π. The value
of the function f is, therefore, unaltered.
A Riemann surface for the double-valued function (2) is obtained by joining
the lower edges in R0 of the slits along L1 and L2 to the upper edges in R1 of
the slits along L1 and L2 , respectively. The lower edges in R1 of the slits along
L1 and L2 are then joined to the upper edges in R0 of the slits along L1 and L2 ,
respectively. It is readily verified with the aid of Fig. 133 that one branch of the
function is represented by its values at points on R0 and the other branch at points
on R1 .

CHAPTER

CONFORMAL MAPPING

In this chapter, we introduce and develop the concept of a conformal mapping, with
emphasis on connections between such mappings and harmonic functions (Sec. 26).
Applications to physical problems will follow in Chap. 10.

101. PRESERVATION OF ANGLES
Let C be a smooth arc (Sec. 39), represented by the equation
z = z(t)

(a ≤ t ≤ b),

and let f (z) be a function defined at all points z on C. The equation
w = f [z(t)]

(a ≤ t ≤ b)

is a parametric representation of the image  of C under the transformation w = f (z).
Suppose that C passes through a point z0 = z(t0 ) (a < t0 < b) at which f is
analytic and that f  (z0 ) = 0. According to the chain rule verified in Exercise 5,
Sec. 39, if w(t) = f [z(t)] , then
(1)

w (t0 ) = f  [z(t0 )]z (t0 );

and this means that (see Sec. 8)
(2)

arg w  (t0 ) = arg f  [z(t0 )] + arg z (t0 ).

Statement (2) is useful in relating the directions of C and  at the points z0 and
w0 = f (z0 ), respectively.
To be specific, let θ0 denote a value of arg z (t0 ) and let φ0 be a value of
arg w  (t0 ). According to the discussion of unit tangent vectors T near the end of
Sec. 39, the number θ0 is the angle of inclination of a directed line tangent to
C at z0 and φ0 is the angle of inclination of a directed line tangent to  at the
point w0 = f (z0 ). (See Fig. 134.) In view of statement (2), there is a value ψ 0 of
arg f  [z(t0 )] such that
φ0 = ψ0 + θ0 .

(3)

Thus φ0 − θ0 = ψ0 , and we find that the angles φ0 and θ0 differ by the angle of
rotation
ψ0 = arg f  (z0 ).

Now let C1 and C2 be two smooth arcs passing through z0 , and let θ1 and θ2
be angles of inclination of directed lines tangent to C1 and C2 , respectively, at z0 .
We know from the preceding paragraph that the quantities
φ1 = ψ0 + θ1

and φ2 = ψ0 + θ2

are angles of inclination of directed lines tangent to the image curves 1 and 2 ,
respectively, at the point w0 = f (z0 ). Thus φ2 − φ1 = θ2 − θ1 ; that is, the angle
φ2 − φ1 from 1 to 2 is the same in magnitude and sense as the angle θ2 − θ1
from C1 to C2 . Those angles are denoted by α in Fig. 135.

Preservation of Angles

357

Because of this angle-preserving property, a transformation w = f (z) is said
to be conformal at a point z0 if f is analytic there and f  (z0 ) = 0. Such a transformation is actually conformal at each point in some neighborhood of z0 . For it
must be analytic in a neighborhood of z0 (Sec. 24); and since its derivative f  is
continuous in that neighborhood (Sec. 52), Theorem 2 in Sec. 18 tells us that there
is also a neighborhood of z0 throughout which f  (z) = 0.
A transformation w = f (z), defined on a domain D, is referred to as a conformal transformation, or conformal mapping, when it is conformal at each point in
D. That is, the mapping is conformal in D if f is analytic in D and its derivative
f  has no zeros there. Each of the elementary functions studied in Chap. 3 can be
used to define a transformation that is conformal in some domain.
EXAMPLE 1. The mapping w = e z is conformal throughout the entire z
plane since (ez ) = ez = 0 for each z. Consider any two lines x = c1 and y = c2 in
the z plane, the first directed upward and the second directed to the right. According
to Example 1 in Sec. 14, their images under the mapping w = ez are a positively
oriented circle centered at the origin and a ray from the origin, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 20 (Sec. 14), the angle between the lines at their point of intersection
is a right angle in the negative direction, and the same is true of the angle between
the circle and the ray at the corresponding point in the w plane. The conformality
of the mapping w = ez is also illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8 of Appendix 2.
EXAMPLE 2. Consider two smooth arcs which are level curves u(x, y) = c1
and v(x, y) = c2 of the real and imaginary components, respectively, of a function
f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y),
and suppose that they intersect at a point z0 where f is analytic and f  (z0 ) = 0.
The transformation w = f (z) is conformal at z0 and maps these arcs into the lines
u = c1 and v = c2 , which are orthogonal at the point w0 = f (z0 ). According to our
theory, then, the arcs must be orthogonal at z0 . This has already been verified and
illustrated in Exercises 7 through 11 of Sec. 26.
A mapping that preserves the magnitude of the angle between two smooth arcs
but not necessarily the sense is called an isogonal mapping.
EXAMPLE 3. The transformation w = z, which is a reflection in the real
axis, is isogonal but not conformal. If it is followed by a conformal transformation,
the resulting transformation w = f (z) is also isogonal but not conformal.
Suppose that f is not a constant function and is analytic at a point z0 . If,
in addition, f  (z0 ) = 0, then z0 is called a critical point of the transformation
w = f (z).

EXAMPLE 4. The point z0 = 0 is a critical point of the transformation
w = 1 + z2 ,
which is a composition of the mappings
Z = z2

and w = 1 + Z.

A ray θ = α from the point z0 = 0 is evidently mapped onto the ray from the point
w0 = 1 whose angle of inclination is 2α, and the angle between any two rays drawn
from z0 = 0 is doubled by the transformation.
More generally, it can be shown that if z0 is a critical point of a transformation
w = f (z), there is an integer m (m ≥ 2) such that the angle between any two smooth
arcs passing through z0 is multiplied by m under that transformation. The integer
m is the smallest positive integer such that f (m) (z0 ) = 0. Verification of these facts
is left to the exercises.

102. SCALE FACTORS
Another property of a transformation w = f (z) that is conformal at a point z0 is
obtained by considering the modulus of f  (z0 ). From the definition of derivative
and a property of limits involving moduli that was derived in Exercise 7, Sec. 18,
we know that



f (z) − f (z0 ) 
|f (z) − f (z0 )|
|f  (z0 )| =  lim
lim
(1)
.
 = z→z
z→z0
z−z
|z − z |

Now |z − z0 | is the length of a line segment joining z0 and z , and |f (z) − f (z0 )|
is the length of the line segment joining the points f (z0 ) and f (z) in the w plane.
Evidently, then, if z is near the point z0 , the ratio
|f (z) − f (z0 )|
|z − z0 |
of the two lengths is approximately the number |f  (z0 )|. Note that |f  (z0 )| represents
an expansion if it is greater than unity and a contraction if it is less than unity.
Although the angle of rotation arg f  (z) (Sec. 101) and the scale factor |f  (z)|
vary, in general, from point to point, it follows from the continuity of f  (see
Sec. 52) that their values are approximately arg f  (z0 ) and |f  (z0 )| at points z near
z0 . Hence the image of a small region in a neighborhood of z0 conforms to the
original region in the sense that it has approximately the same shape. A large region
may, however, be transformed into a region that bears no resemblance to the original
one.

is conformal at the point z = 1 + i, where the half lines
y = x (x ≥ 0)

and x = 1 (y ≥ 0)

intersect. We denote those half lines by C1 and C2 (Fig. 136), with positive sense
upward. Observe that the angle from C1 to C2 is π/4 at their point of intersection.
Since the image of a point z = (x, y) is a point in the w plane whose rectangular
coordinates are
u = x2 − y2

and v = 2xy,

the half line C1 is transformed into the curve 1 with parametric representation
v = 2x 2

u = 0,

(0 ≤ x < ∞).

Thus 1 is the upper half v ≥ 0 of the v axis. The half line C2 is transformed into
the curve 2 represented by the equations
u = 1 − y2,

(3)

v = 2y

(0 ≤ y < ∞).

Hence 2 is the upper half of the parabola v 2 = −4(u − 1). Note that in each case,
the positive sense of the image curve is upward.

by the conformality of the mapping at z = 1 + i. The angle of rotation π/4 at the

To illustrate how the angle of rotation and the scale factor can change from
point to point, we note that they are 0 and 2, respectively, at the point z = 1 since
f  (1) = 2. See Fig. 136, where the curves C2 and 2 are the ones just discussed
and where the nonnegative x axis C3 is transformed into the nonnegative u axis 3 .

103. LOCAL INVERSES
A transformation w = f (z) that is conformal at a point z0 has a local inverse
there. That is, if w0 = f (z0 ), then there exists a unique transformation z = g(w),
which is defined and analytic in a neighborhood N of w0 , such that g(w0 ) = z0 and
f [g(w)] = w for all points w in N . The derivative of g(w) is, moreover,
g  (w) =

(1)

1
f  (z)

.

We note from expression (1) that the transformation z = g(w) is itself conformal
at w0 .
Assuming that w = f (z) is, in fact, conformal at z0 , let us verify the existence
of such an inverse, which is a direct consequence of results in advanced calculus.∗
As noted in Sec. 101, the conformality of the transformation w = f (z) at z0 implies
that there is some neighborhood of z0 throughout which f is analytic. Hence if we
write
z = x + iy,

z0 = x0 + iy0 ,

and f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y),

we know that there is a neighborhood of the point (x0 , y0 ) throughout which the
functions u(x, y) and v(x, y), along with their partial derivatives of all orders, are
continuous (see Sec. 52).
Now the pair of equations
(2)

u = u(x, y),

v = v(x, y)

represents a transformation from the neighborhood just mentioned into the uv plane.
Moreover, the determinant


u uy 
 = ux vy − vx uy ,
J =  x
vx vy 
which is known as the Jacobian of the transformation, is nonzero at the point
(x0 , y0 ). For, in view of the Cauchy–Riemann equations ux = vy and uy = −vx ,
one can write J as
J = (ux )2 + (vx )2 = |f  (z)|2 ;
and f  (z0 ) = 0 since the transformation w = f (z) is conformal at z0 . The above
continuity conditions on the functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) and their derivatives,

together with this condition on the Jacobian, are sufficient to ensure the existence
of a local inverse of transformation (2) at (x0 , y0 ). That is, if
u0 = u(x0 , y0 ) and v0 = v(x0 , y0 ),

(3)

then there is a unique continuous transformation
x = x(u, v),

(4)

y = y(u, v),

defined on a neighborhood N of the point (u0 , v0 ) and mapping that point onto
(x0 , y0 ), such that equations (2) hold when equations (4) hold. Also, in addition to
being continuous, the functions (4) have continuous first-order partial derivatives
satisfying the equations

If we write w = u + iv and w0 = u0 + iv0 , as well as
(6)

g(w) = x(u, v) + iy(u, v),

the transformation z = g(w) is evidently the local inverse of the original transformation w = f (z) at z0 . Transformations (2) and (4) can be written
u + iv = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)

and x + iy = x(u, v) + iy(u, v);

and these last two equations are the same as
w = f (z)

and z = g(w),

where g has the desired properties. Equations (5) can be used to show that g is
analytic in N . Details are left to the exercises, where expression (1) for g  (w) is
also derived.
EXAMPLE. We know from Example 1, Sec. 101, that if f (z) = e z , the
transformation w = f (z) is conformal everywhere in the z plane and, in particular,
at the point z0 = 2πi. The image of this choice of z0 is the point w0 = 1. When
points in the w plane are expressed in the form w = ρ exp(iφ), the local inverse at
z0 can be obtained by writing g(w) = log w, where log w denotes the branch
log w = ln ρ + iφ

(ρ > 0, π < θ < 3π)

of the logarithmic function, restricted to any neighborhood of w0 that does not
contain the origin. Observe that
g(1) = ln 1 + i2π = 2πi

Note that if the point z0 = 0 is chosen, one can use the principal branch

function g(w) defined by equation (6) there are continuous and have continuous firstorder partial derivatives in a neighborhood N. Use equations (5), Sec. 103, to show
that the Cauchy–Riemann equations xu = yv , xv = −yu hold in N. Then conclude that

φ0 = mθ0 + arg f (m) (z0 ).
(c) Let α denote the angle between two smooth arcs C1 and C2 passing through z0 ,

obtained in part (b) that the corresponding angle between the image curves  1
and 2 at the point w0 = f (z0 ) is mα. (Note that the transformation is conformal
at z0 when m = 1 and that z0 is a critical point when m ≥ 2.)

104. HARMONIC CONJUGATES
We saw in Sec. 26 that if a function
f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)
is analytic in a domain D, then the real-valued functions u and v are harmonic in
that domain. That is, they have continuous partial derivatives of the first and second
order in D and satisfy Laplace’s equation there:
(1)

uxx + uyy = 0,

vxx + vyy = 0.

11:40am

We had seen earlier that the first-order partial derivatives of u and v satisfy the
Cauchy–Riemann equations
(2)

ux = vy ,

uy = −vx ;

and, as pointed out in Sec. 26, v is called a harmonic conjugate of u.
Suppose now that u(x, y) is any given harmonic function defined on a simply
connected (Sec. 48) domain D. In this section, we show that u(x, y) always has a
harmonic conjugate v(x, y) in D by deriving an expression for v(x, y).
To accomplish this, we first recall some important facts about line integrals in
advanced calculus.∗ Suppose that P (x, y) and Q(x, y) have continuous first-order
partial derivatives in a simply connected domain D of the xy plane, and let (x0 , y0 )
and (x, y) be any two points in D. If Py = Qx everywhere in D, then the line
integral

P (s, t) ds + Q(s, t) dt
C

from (x0 , y0 ) to (x, y) is independent of the contour C that is taken as long as
the contour lies entirely in D. Furthermore, when the point (x0 , y0 ) is kept fixed
and (x, y) is allowed to vary throughout D, the integral represents a single-valued
function
 (x,y)
(3)
P (s, t) ds + Q(s, t) dt
F (x, y) =
(x0 ,y0 )

of x and y whose first-order partial derivatives are given by the equations
(4)

Fx (x, y) = P (x, y),

Fy (x, y) = Q(x, y).

Note that the value of F is changed by an additive constant when a different starting
point (x0 , y0 ) is taken.
Returning to the given harmonic function u(x, y), observe how it follows from
Laplace’s equation uxx + uyy = 0 that
(−uy )y = (ux )x
everywhere in D. Also, the second-order partial derivatives of u are continuous
in D; and this means that the first-order partial derivatives of −uy and ux are
continuous there. Thus, if (x0 , y0 ) is a fixed point in D, the function
 (x,y)
v(x, y) =
(5)
−ut (s, t) ds + us (s, t) dt
(x0 ,y0 )

is well defined for all (x, y) in D; and, according to equations (4),
(6)

vx (x, y) = −uy (x, y),

vy (x, y) = ux (x, y).

These are the Cauchy–Riemann equations. Since the first-order partial derivatives
of u are continuous, it is evident from equations (6) that those derivatives of v are
also continuous. Hence (Sec. 22) u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is an analytic function in D;
and v is, therefore, a harmonic conjugate of u.
The function v defined by equation (5) is, of course, not the only harmonic
conjugate of u. The function v(x, y) + c, where c is any real constant, is also a
harmonic conjugate of u. [Recall Exercise 2, Sec. 26.]
EXAMPLE. Consider the function u(x, y) = xy, which is harmonic throughout the entire xy plane. According to equation (5), the function
 (x,y)
v(x, y) =
−s ds + t dt
(0,0)

is a harmonic conjugate of u(x, y). The integral here is readily evaluated by inspection. It can also be evaluated by integrating first along the horizontal path from the
point (0, 0) to the point (x, 0) and then along the vertical path from (x, 0) to the
point (x, y). The result is

105. TRANSFORMATIONS OF HARMONIC FUNCTIONS
The problem of finding a function that is harmonic in a specified domain and
satisfies prescribed conditions on the boundary of the domain is prominent in applied
mathematics. If the values of the function are prescribed along the boundary, the
problem is known as a boundary value problem of the first kind, or a Dirichlet
problem. If the values of the normal derivative of the function are prescribed on
the boundary, the boundary value problem is one of the second kind, or a Neumann
problem. Modifications and combinations of those types of boundary conditions also
arise.
The domains most frequently encountered in the applications are simply connected; and, since a function that is harmonic in a simply connected domain always
has a harmonic conjugate (Sec. 104), solutions of boundary value problems for such
domains are the real or imaginary components of analytic functions.
EXAMPLE 1. In Example 1, Sec. 26, we saw that the function
T (x, y) = e−y sin x

11:40am

satisfies a certain Dirichlet problem for the strip 0 < x < π, y > 0 and noted that it
represents a solution of a temperature problem. The function T (x, y), which is actually harmonic throughout the xy plane, is the real component of the entire function
−ieiz = e−y sin x − ie−y cos x.
It is also the imaginary component of the entire function eiz .
Sometimes a solution of a given boundary value problem can be discovered
by identifying it as the real or imaginary component of an analytic function. But
the success of that procedure depends on the simplicity of the problem and on
one’s familiarity with the real and imaginary components of a variety of analytic
functions. The following theorem is an important aid.
Theorem. Suppose that an analytic function
(1)

w = f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)

maps a domain Dz in the z plane onto a domain Dw in the w plane. If h(u, v) is a
harmonic function defined on Dw , then the function
(2)

H (x, y) = h[u(x, y), v(x, y)]

is harmonic in Dz .
We first prove the theorem for the case in which the domain Dw is simply connected. According to Sec. 104, that property of Dw ensures that the given harmonic
function h(u, v) has a harmonic conjugate g(u, v). Hence the function
(3)

(w) = h(u, v) + ig(u, v)

is analytic in Dw . Since the function f (z) is analytic in Dz , the composite function
[f (z)] is also analytic in Dz . Consequently, the real part h[u(x, y), v(x, y)] of
this composition is harmonic in Dz .
If Dw is not simply connected, we observe that each point w0 in Dw has
a neighborhood |w − w0 | < ε lying entirely in Dw . Since that neighborhood is
simply connected, a function of the type (3) is analytic in it. Furthermore, since
f is continuous at a point z0 in Dz whose image is w0 , there is a neighborhood
|z − z0 | < δ whose image is contained in the neighborhood |w − w0 | < ε. Hence it
follows that the composition [f (z)] is analytic in the neighborhood |z − z0 | < δ,
and we may conclude that h[u(x, y), v(x, y)] is harmonic there. Finally, since w0
was arbitrarily chosen in Dw and since each point in Dz is mapped onto such a
point under the transformation w = f (z), the function h[u(x, y), v(x, y)] must be
harmonic throughout Dz .
The proof of the theorem for the general case in which Dw is not necessarily
simply connected can also be accomplished directly by means of the chain rule

for partial derivatives. The computations are, however, somewhat involved (see
Exercise 8, Sec. 106).
EXAMPLE 2. The function h(u, v) = e −v sin u is harmonic in the domain
Dw consisting of all points in the upper half plane v > 0 (see Example 1). If the
transformation is w = z2 , we have u(x, y) = x 2 − y 2 and v(x, y) = 2xy; moreover,
the domain Dz consisting of the points in the first quadrant x > 0, y > 0 of the z
plane is mapped onto the domain Dw , as shown in Example 3, Sec. 13. Hence the
function
H (x, y) = e−2xy sin(x 2 − y 2 )
is harmonic in Dz .
EXAMPLE 3. A minor modification of Fig. 114 in Example 3, Sec. 95,
reveals that as a point z = r exp(i 0 ) (−π/2 < 0 < π/2) travels outward from
the origin along a ray = 0 in the z plane, its image under the transformation
w = Log z = ln r + i

(r > 0, −π <

< π)

travels along the entire length of the horizontal line v = 0 in the w plane. So the
right half plane x > 0 is mapped onto the horizontal strip −π/2 < v < π/2. By
considering the function
h(u, v) = Im w = v,
which is harmonic in the strip, and writing

y
Log z = ln x 2 + y 2 + iarctan ,
x
where −π/2 < arctan t < π/2, we find that
y
H (x, y) = arctan
x
is harmonic in the half plane x > 0.

106. TRANSFORMATIONS OF BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
The conditions that a function or its normal derivative have prescribed values along
the boundary of a domain in which it is harmonic are the most common, although
not the only, important types of boundary conditions. In this section, we show that
certain of these conditions remain unaltered under the change of variables associated
with a conformal transformation. These results will be used in Chap. 10 to solve
boundary value problems. The basic technique there is to transform a given boundary
value problem in the xy plane into a simpler one in the uv plane and then to use
the theorems of this and Sec. 105 to write the solution of the original problem in
terms of the solution obtained for the simpler one.

To show that the condition h = h0 on  implies that H = h0 on C, we note
from equation (3) that the value of H at any point (x, y) on C is the same as the
value of h at the image (u, v) of (x, y) under transformation (1). Since the image
point (u, v) lies on  and since h = h0 along that curve, it follows that H = h0
along C.
Suppose, on the other hand, that dh/dn = 0 on . From calculus, we know
that
dh
(5)
= (grad h) · n,
dn
where grad h denotes the gradient of h at a point (u, v) on  and n is a unit vector
normal to  at (u, v). Since dh/dn = 0 at (u, v), equation (5) tells us that grad h
is orthogonal to n at (u, v). That is, grad h is tangent to  there (Fig. 137). But
gradients are orthogonal to level curves; and, because grad h is tangent to , we
see that  is orthogonal to a level curve h(u, v) = c passing through (u, v).

Now, according to equation (3), the level curve H (x, y) = c in the z plane can
be written
h[u(x, y), v(x, y)] = c ;
and so it is evidently transformed into the level curve h(u, v) = c under transformation (1). Furthermore, since C is transformed into  and  is orthogonal to
the level curve h(u, v) = c, as demonstrated in the preceding paragraph, it follows from the conformality of transformation (1) that C is orthogonal to the level
curve H (x, y) = c at the point (x, y) corresponding to (u, v). Because gradients
are orthogonal to level curves, this means that grad H is tangent to C at (x, y) (see
Fig. 137). Consequently, if N denotes a unit vector normal to C at (x, y), grad H
is orthogonal to N. That is,
(6)

(grad H ) · N = 0.

Finally, since

dH
= (grad H ) · N,
dN
we may conclude from equation (6) that dH /dN = 0 at points on C.
In this discussion, we have tacitly assumed that grad h = 0. If grad h = 0, it
follows from the identity
|grad H (x, y)| = |grad h(u, v)||f  (z)|,
derived in Exercise 10(a) of this section, that grad H = 0; hence dh/dn and the
corresponding normal derivative dH /dN are both zero. We have also assumed that
(a) grad h and grad H always exist ;
(b) the level curve H (x, y) = c is smooth when grad h = 0 at (u, v).
Condition (b) ensures that angles between arcs are preserved by transformation
(1) when it is conformal. In all of our applications, both conditions (a) and (b) will
be satisfied.
EXAMPLE. Consider, for instance, the function h(u, v) = v + 2. The transformation
w = iz2 = −2xy + i(x 2 − y 2 )
is conformal when z = 0. It maps the half line y = x (x > 0) onto the negative
u axis, where h = 2, and the positive x axis onto the positive v axis, where the
normal derivative hu is 0 (Fig. 138). According to the above theorem, the function
H (x, y) = x 2 − y 2 + 2
must satisfy the condition H = 2 along the half line y = x (x > 0) and Hy = 0
along the positive x axis, as one can verify directly.

A boundary condition that is not of one of the two types mentioned in the
theorem may be transformed into a condition that is substantially different from the
original one (see Exercise 6). New boundary conditions for the transformed problem
can be obtained for a particular transformation in any case. It is interesting to note
that under a conformal transformation , the ratio of a directional derivative of H
along a smooth arc C in the z plane to the directional derivative of h along the
image curve  at the corresponding point in the w plane is |f  (z)|; usually, this
ratio is not constant along a given arc. (See Exercise 10.)

EXERCISES
1. Use expression (5), Sec. 104, to find a harmonic conjugate of the harmonic function
u(x, y) = x 3 − 3xy 2 . Write the resulting analytic function in terms of the complex
variable z.
2. Let u(x, y) be harmonic in a simply connected domain D. By appealing to results
in Secs. 104 and 52, show that its partial derivatives of all orders are continuous
throughout that domain.
3. The transformation w = exp z maps the horizontal strip 0 < y < π onto the upper half
plane v > 0, as shown in Fig. 6 of Appendix 2 ; and the function
h(u, v) = Re(w 2 ) = u2 − v 2
is harmonic in that half plane. With the aid of the theorem in Sec. 105, show that the
function H (x, y) = e2x cos 2y is harmonic in the strip. Verify this result directly.
4. Under the transformation w = exp z, the image of the segment 0 ≤ y ≤ π of the y
axis is the semicircle u2 + v 2 = 1, v ≥ 0 (see Sec. 14). Also, the function

h = 2 on the semicircle. Write an explicit expression for the function H (x, y) in the
theorem of Sec. 106. Then illustrate the theorem by showing directly that H = 2 along
the segment 0 ≤ y ≤ π of the y axis.

5. The transformation w = z2 maps the positive x and y axes and the origin in the z
plane onto the u axis in the w plane. Consider the harmonic function
h(u, v) = Re(e−w ) = e−u cos v,
and observe that its normal derivative hv along the u axis is zero. Then illustrate the
theorem in Sec. 106 when f (z) = z2 by showing directly that the normal derivative
of the function H (x, y) defined in that theorem is zero along both positive axes in the
z plane. (Note that the transformation w = z 2 is not conformal at the origin.)
6. Replace the function h(u, v) in Exercise 5 by the harmonic function
h(u, v) = Re(−2iw + e−w ) = 2v + e−u cos v.
Then show that hv = 2 along the u axis but that Hy = 4x along the positive x axis
and Hx = 4y along the positive y axis. This illustrates how a condition of the type
dh
= h0 = 0
dn
is not necessarily transformed into a condition of the type dH /dN = h0 .
7. Show that if a function H (x, y) is a solution of a Neumann problem (Sec. 105), then
H (x, y) + A, where A is any real constant, is also a solution of that problem.
8. Suppose that an analytic function w = f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) maps a domain Dz
in the z plane onto a domain Dw in the w plane; and let a function h(u, v), with
continuous partial derivatives of the first and second order, be defined on D w . Use the
chain rule for partial derivatives to show that if H (x, y) = h[u(x, y), v(x, y)], then
Hxx (x, y) + Hyy (x, y) = [huu (u, v) + hvv (u, v)] |f  (z)|2 .
Conclude that the function H (x, y) is harmonic in Dz when h(u, v) is harmonic in
Dw . This is an alternative proof of the theorem in Sec. 105, even when the domain
Dw is multiply connected.
Suggestion: In the simplifications, it is important to note that since f is analytic ,
the Cauchy–Riemann equations ux = vy , uy = −vx hold and that the functions u and v
both satisfy Laplace’s equation. Also, the continuity conditions on the derivatives of
h ensure that hvu = huv .
9. Let p(u, v) be a function that has continuous partial derivatives of the first and second
order and satisfies Poisson’s equation
puu (u, v) + pvv (u, v) = (u, v)
in a domain Dw of the w plane, where  is a prescribed function. Show how it follows
from the identity obtained in Exercise 8 that if an analytic function
w = f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)
maps a domain Dz onto the domain Dw , then the function
P (x, y) = p[u(x, y), v(x, y)]

10. Suppose that w = f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is a conformal mapping of a smooth arc
C onto a smooth arc  in the w plane. Let the function h(u, v) be defined on , and
write
H (x, y) = h[u(x, y), v(x, y)].
(a) From calculus, we know that the x and y components of grad H are the partial
derivatives Hx and Hy , respectively; likewise, grad h has components hu and hv .
By applying the chain rule for partial derivatives and using the Cauchy–Riemann
equations, show that if (x, y) is a point on C and (u, v) is its image on , then
|grad H (x, y)| = |grad h(u, v)||f  (z)|.
(b) Show that the angle from the arc C to grad H at a point (x, y) on C is equal to
the angle from  to grad h at the image (u, v) of the point (x, y).
(c) Let s and σ denote distance along the arcs C and , respectively; and let t and

APPLICATIONS OF CONFORMAL
MAPPING

We now use conformal mapping to solve a number of physical problems involving
Laplace’s equation in two independent variables. Problems in heat conduction, electrostatic potential, and fluid flow will be treated. Since these problems are intended
to illustrate methods, they will be kept on a fairly elementary level.

107. STEADY TEMPERATURES
In the theory of heat conduction, the flux across a surface within a solid body at a
point on that surface is the quantity of heat flowing in a specified direction normal
to the surface per unit time per unit area at the point. Flux is, therefore, measured
in such units as calories per second per square centimeter. It is denoted here by ,
and it varies with the normal derivative of the temperature T at the point on the
surface:
(1)

 = −K

dT
dN

(K > 0).

Relation (1) is known as Fourier’s law and the constant K is called the thermal
conductivity of the material of the solid, which is assumed to be homogeneous.∗
The points in the solid can be assigned rectangular coordinates in threedimensional space, and we restrict our attention to those cases in which the temperature T varies with only the x and y coordinates. Since T does not vary with the
∗ The law is named for the French mathematical physicist Joseph Fourier (1768–1830). His book,

cited in Appendix 1, is a classic in the theory of heat conduction.

coordinate along the axis perpendicular to the xy plane, the flow of heat is, then,
two-dimensional and parallel to that plane. We agree, moreover, that the flow is in
a steady state; that is, T does not vary with time.
It is assumed that no thermal energy is created or destroyed within the solid.
That is, no heat sources or sinks are present there. Also, the temperature function
T (x, y) and its partial derivatives of the first and second order are continuous at each
point interior to the solid. This statement and expression (1) for the flux of heat are
postulates in the mathematical theory of heat conduction, postulates that also apply
at points within a solid containing a continuous distribution of sources or sinks.
Consider now an element of volume that is interior to the solid and has the
shape of a rectangular prism of unit height perpendicular to the xy plane, with base
x by y in the plane (Fig. 139). The time rate of flow of heat toward the right
across the left-hand face is −KTx (x, y)y ; and toward the right across the righthand face, it is −KTx (x + x, y)y. Subtracting the first rate from the second,
we obtain the net rate of heat loss from the element through those two faces. This
resultant rate can be written

if x is very small. Expression (2) is, of course, an approximation whose accuracy
increases as x and y are made smaller.

In like manner, the resultant rate of heat loss through the other two faces
perpendicular to the xy plane is found to be

Heat enters or leaves the element only through these four faces, and the temperatures
within the element are steady. Hence the sum of expressions (2) and (3) is zero;
that is,
(4)

Txx (x, y) + Tyy (x, y) = 0.

Steady Temperatures in a Half Plane

375

The temperature function thus satisfies Laplace’s equation at each interior point of
the solid.
In view of equation (4) and the continuity of the temperature function and its
partial derivatives, T is a harmonic function of x and y in the domain representing
the interior of the solid body.
The surfaces T (x, y) = c1 , where c1 is any real constant, are the isotherms
within the solid. They can also be considered as curves in the xy plane ; then
T (x, y) can be interpreted as the temperature at a point (x, y) in a thin sheet of
material in that plane, with the faces of the sheet thermally insulated. The isotherms
are the level curves of the function T .
The gradient of T is perpendicular to an isotherm at each point on it, and the
maximum flux at such a point is in the direction of the gradient there. If T (x, y)
denotes temperatures in a thin sheet and if S is a harmonic conjugate of the function
T , then a curve S(x, y) = c2 has the gradient of T as a tangent vector at each
point where the analytic function T (x, y) + iS(x, y) is conformal (see Exercise 7,
Sec. 26). The curves S(x, y) = c2 are called lines of flow.
If the normal derivative dT /dN is zero along any part of the boundary of the
sheet, then the flux of heat across that part is zero. That is, the part is thermally
insulated and is, therefore, a line of flow.
The function T may also denote the concentration of a substance that is diffusing through a solid. In that case, K is the diffusion constant. The above discussion
and the derivation of equation (4) apply as well to steady-state diffusion.

108. STEADY TEMPERATURES IN A HALF PLANE
Let us find an expression for the steady temperatures T (x, y) in a thin semi-infinite
plate y ≥ 0 whose faces are insulated and whose edge y = 0 is kept at temperature
zero except for the segment −1 < x < 1, where it is kept at temperature unity
(Fig. 140). The function T (x, y) is to be bounded ; this condition is natural if we
consider the given plate as the limiting case of the plate 0 ≤ y ≤ y0 whose upper
edge is kept at a fixed temperature as y0 is increased. In fact, it would be physically
reasonable to stipulate that T (x, y) approach zero as y tends to infinity.

Txx (x, y) + Tyy (x, y) = 0

1 when |x| < 1,
T (x, 0) =
0 when |x| > 1;

also, |T (x, y)| < M where M is some positive constant. This is a Dirichlet problem
for the upper half of the xy plane. Our method of solution will be to obtain a new
Dirichlet problem for a region in the uv plane. That region will be the image of the
half plane under a transformation w = f (z) that is analytic in the domain y > 0
and conformal along the boundary y = 0 except at the points (±1, 0), where f (z)
is undefined. It will be a simple matter to discover a bounded harmonic function
satisfying the new problem. The two theorems in Chap. 9 will then be applied to
transform the solution of the problem in the uv plane into a solution of the original
problem in the xy plane. Specifically, a harmonic function of u and v will be
transformed into a harmonic function of x and y, and the boundary conditions in
the uv plane will be preserved on corresponding portions of the boundary in the xy
plane. There should be no confusion if we use the same symbol T to denote the
different temperature functions in the two planes.
Let us write
z − 1 = r1 exp(iθ1 )

and z + 1 = r2 exp(iθ2 ),

is defined on the upper half plane y ≥ 0, except for the two points z = ±1, since
0 ≤ θ1 − θ2 ≤ π when y ≥ 0. (See Fig. 140.) Now the value of the logarithm is the
principal value when 0 ≤ θ1 − θ2 ≤ π, and we recall from Example 3 in Sec. 95
that the upper half plane y > 0 is then mapped onto the horizontal strip 0 < v < π
in the w plane. As already noted in that example, the mapping is shown with
corresponding boundary points in Fig. 19 of Appendix 2. Indeed, it was that figure
which suggested transformation (3) here. The segment of the x axis between z = −1
and z = 1, where θ1 − θ2 = π, is mapped onto the upper edge of the strip ; and the
rest of the x axis, where θ1 − θ2 = 0, is mapped onto the lower edge. The required
analyticity and conformality conditions are evidently satisfied by transformation (3).

Since the function (4) is harmonic in the strip 0 < v < π and since transformation (3) is analytic in the half plane y > 0, we may apply the theorem in Sec. 105
to conclude that the function (6) is harmonic in that half plane. The boundary conditions for the two harmonic functions are the same on corresponding parts of the
boundaries because they are of the type h = h0 , treated in the theorem of Sec. 106.
The bounded function (6) is, therefore, the desired solution of the original problem.
One can, of course, verify directly that the function (6) satisfies Laplace’s equation
and has the values tending to those indicated on the left in Fig. 140 as the point
(x, y) approaches the x axis from above.

condition T = 0 when |u| > 1 and v = 0. The function (6) thus satisfies boundary
conditions (2) and (3). Moreover, |T (x, y)| ≤ 1 throughout the strip. Expression (6)

a segment at the end of one edge is insulated, if the rest of that edge is kept at a
fixed temperature, and if the second edge is kept at another fixed temperature. The
surfaces are insulated, and so the problem is two-dimensional.

As indicated in Fig. 10 of Appendix 2, the transformation
(4)

z = sin w

is a one to one mapping of the semi-infinite strip 0 ≤ u ≤ π/2, v ≥ 0 onto the quadrant x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0. Observe now that the existence of an inverse is ensured by the
fact that the given transformation is both one to one and onto. Since transformation
(4) is conformal throughout the strip except at the point w = π/2, the inverse transformation must be conformal throughout the quadrant except at the point z = 1. That
inverse transformation maps the segment 0 < x < 1 of the x axis onto the base of
the strip and the rest of the boundary onto the sides of the strip as shown in Fig. 142.
Since the inverse of transformation (4) is conformal in the quadrant, except
when z = 1, the solution to the given problem can be obtained by finding a function
that is harmonic in the strip and satisfies the boundary conditions shown on the right
in Fig. 142. Observe that these boundary conditions are of the types h = h0 and
dh/dn = 0 in the theorem of Sec. 106.

the function (2/π)u being the real component of the entire function (2/π)w. We

Now it is convenient to observe that for each fixed u, hyperbola (7) has foci at the
points
z = ± sin2 u + cos2 u = ±1
and that the length of the transverse axis, which is the line segment joining the
two vertices (± sin u, 0), is 2 sin u. Thus the absolute value of the difference of the
distances between the foci and a point (x, y) lying on the part of the hyperbola in
the first quadrant is
(x + 1)2 + y 2 −

(x − 1)2 + y 2 = 2 sin u.

It follows directly from equations (6) that this relation also holds when u = 0 or
u = π/2. In view of equation (5), then, the required temperature function is

where, since 0 ≤ u ≤ π/2, the arcsine function has the range 0 to π/2.
If we wish to verify that this function satisfies boundary conditions (2), we must
remember that (x − 1)2 denotes x − 1 when x > 1 and 1 − x when 0 < x < 1,
the square roots being positive. Note, too, that the temperature at any point along
the insulated part of the lower edge of the plate is

It can be seen from equation (5) that the isotherms T (x, y) = c1 (0 < c1 < 1)
are the parts of the confocal hyperbolas (7), where u = πc 1 /2, which lie in the first
quadrant. Since the function (2/π)v is a harmonic conjugate of the function (5), the
lines of flow are quarters of the confocal ellipses obtained by holding v constant in
equations (6).

Electrostatic Potential

12. Consider a thin plate, with insulated faces, whose shape is the upper half of the region
enclosed by an ellipse with foci (±1, 0). The temperature on the elliptical part of its
boundary is T = 1. The temperature along the segment −1 < x < 1 of the x axis is
T = 0, and the rest of the boundary along the x axis is insulated. With the aid of
Fig. 11 in Appendix 2, find the lines of flow of heat.
13. According to Sec. 54 and Exercise 6 of that section, if f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)
is continuous on a closed bounded region R and analytic and not constant in the
interior of R, then the function u(x, y) reaches its maximum and minimum values
on the boundary of R, and never in the interior. By interpreting u(x, y) as a steady
temperature, state a physical reason why that property of maximum and minimum
values should hold true.

111. ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL
In an electrostatic force field, the field intensity at a point is a vector representing
the force exerted on a unit positive charge placed at that point. The electrostatic
potential is a scalar function of the space coordinates such that, at each point, its
directional derivative in any direction is the negative of the component of the field
intensity in that direction.
For two stationary charged particles, the magnitude of the force of attraction or
repulsion exerted by one particle on the other is directly proportional to the product
of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between
those particles. From this inverse-square law, it can be shown that the potential at
a point due to a single particle in space is inversely proportional to the distance
between the point and the particle. In any region free of charges, the potential due
to a distribution of charges outside that region can be shown to satisfy Laplace’s
equation for three-dimensional space.
If conditions are such that the potential V is the same in all planes parallel to
the xy plane, then in regions free of charges V is a harmonic function of just the
two variables x and y:
Vxx (x, y) + Vyy (x, y) = 0.
The field intensity vector at each point is parallel to the xy plane, with x and y
components −Vx (x, y) and −Vy (x, y), respectively. That vector is, therefore, the
negative of the gradient of V (x, y).
A surface along which V (x, y) is constant is an equipotential surface. The
tangential component of the field intensity vector at a point on a conducting surface is zero in the static case since charges are free to move on such a surface.
Hence V (x, y) is constant along the surface of a conductor, and that surface is an
equipotential.
If U is a harmonic conjugate of V , the curves U (x, y) = c2 in the xy plane are
called flux lines. When such a curve intersects an equipotential curve V (x, y) = c1
at a point where the derivative of the analytic function V (x, y) + iU (x, y) is not
zero, the two curves are orthogonal at that point and the field intensity is tangent to
the flux line there.

Boundary value problems for the potential V are the same mathematical problems as those for steady temperatures T ; and, as in the case of steady temperatures,
the methods of complex variables are limited to two-dimensional problems. The
problem posed in Sec. 109 (see Fig. 141), for instance, can be interpreted as that of
finding the two-dimensional electrostatic potential in the empty space

bounded by the conducting planes x = ±π/2 and y = 0, insulated at their intersections,
when the first two surfaces are kept at potential zero and the third at potential unity.
The potential in the steady flow of electricity in a conducting sheet lying in a
plane is also a harmonic function at points free from sources and sinks. Gravitational
potential is a further example of a harmonic function in physics.

112. POTENTIAL IN A CYLINDRICAL SPACE
A long hollow circular cylinder is made out of a thin sheet of conducting material,
and the cylinder is split lengthwise to form two equal parts. Those parts are separated
by slender strips of insulating material and are used as electrodes, one of which is
grounded at potential zero and the other kept at a different fixed potential. We take
the coordinate axes and units of length and potential difference as indicated on the
left in Fig. 150. We then interpret the electrostatic potential V (x, y) over any cross
section of the enclosed space that is distant from the ends of the cylinder as a
harmonic function inside the circle x 2 + y 2 = 1 in the xy plane. Note that V = 0
on the upper half of the circle and that V = 1 on the lower half.

The equipotential curves V (x, y) = c1 (0 < c1 < 1) in the circular region are
arcs of the circles

with each circle passing through the points (±1, 0). Also, the segment of the x axis
between those points is the equipotential V (x, y) = 1/2. A harmonic conjugate U
of V is −(1/π) ln ρ, or the imaginary part of the function −(i/π)Log w. In view
of equation (4), U may be written

a flux line.

Two-Dimensional Fluid Flow

391

113. TWO-DIMENSIONAL FLUID FLOW
Harmonic functions play an important role in hydrodynamics and aerodynamics.
Again, we consider only the two-dimensional steady-state type of problem. That is,
the motion of the fluid is assumed to be the same in all planes parallel to the xy
plane, the velocity being parallel to that plane and independent of time. It is, then,
sufficient to consider the motion of a sheet of fluid in the xy plane.
We let the vector representing the complex number
V = p + iq
denote the velocity of a particle of the fluid at any point (x, y); hence the x and y
components of the velocity vector are p(x, y) and q(x, y), respectively. At points
interior to a region of flow in which no sources or sinks of the fluid occur, the
real-valued functions p(x, y) and q(x, y) and their first-order partial derivatives are
assumed to be continuous.
The circulation of the fluid along any contour C is defined as the line integral
with respect to arc length σ of the tangential component VT (x, y) of the velocity
vector along C:
(1)

VT (x, y) dσ.
C

The ratio of the circulation along C to the length of C is, therefore, a mean speed of
the fluid along that contour. It is shown in advanced calculus that such an integral
can be written∗
VT (x, y) dσ =

(2)
C

p(x, y) dx + q(x, y) dy.
C

When C is a positively oriented simple closed contour lying in a simply connected
domain of flow containing no sources or sinks, Green’s theorem (see Sec. 46)
enables us to write
p(x, y) dx + q(x, y) dy =
C

[qx (x, y) − py (x, y)] dA,
R

where R is the closed region consisting of points interior to and on C. Thus
VT (x, y) dσ =

(3)
C

[qx (x, y) − py (x, y)] dA
R

for such a contour
A physical interpretation of the integrand on the right in expression (3) for the
circulation along the simple closed contour C is readily given. We let C denote a

The mean speed along C is then found by dividing the circulation by the circumference 2πr, and the corresponding mean angular speed of the fluid about the center
of the circle is obtained by dividing that mean speed by r:
l

[qx (x, y) − py (x, y)] dA.
R 2

Now this is also an expression for the mean value of the function
(4)

ω(x, y) =

1
[qx (x, y) − py (x, y)]
2

over the circular region R bounded by C. Its limit as r tends to zero is the value of
ω at the point (x0 , y0 ). Hence the function ω(x, y), called the rotation of the fluid,
represents the limiting angular speed of a circular element of the fluid as the circle
shrinks to its center (x, y), the point at which ω is evaluated.
If ω(x, y) = 0 at each point in some simply connected domain, the flow is
irrotational in that domain. We consider only irrotational flows here, and we also
assume that the fluid is incompressible and free from viscosity. Under our assumption
of steady irrotational flow of fluids with uniform density ρ, it can be shown that the
fluid pressure P (x, y) satisfies the following special case of Bernoulli’s equation:
P
1
+ |V |2 = c,
ρ
2
where c is a constant. Note that the pressure is greatest where the speed |V | is least.
Let D be a simply connected domain in which the flow is irrotational. According to equation (4), py = qx throughout D. This relation between partial derivatives
implies that the line integral
p(s, t) ds + q(s, t) dt
C

along a contour C lying entirely in D and joining any two points (x0 , y0 ) and (x, y)
in D is actually independent of path. Thus, if (x0 , y0 ) is fixed, the function
(5)

φ(x, y) =

(x,y)

p(s, t) ds + q(s, t) dt

(x0 ,y0 )

is well defined on D; and, by taking partial derivatives on each side of this equation,
we find that
(6)

φx (x, y) = p(x, y),

φy (x, y) = q(x, y).

From equations (6), we see that the velocity vector V = p + iq is the gradient
of φ; and the directional derivative of φ in any direction represents the component
of the velocity of flow in that direction.
The function φ(x, y) is called the velocity potential. From equation (5), it
is evident that φ(x, y) changes by an additive constant when the reference point

The Stream Function

(x0 , y0 ) is changed. The level curves φ(x, y) = c1 are called equipotentials. Because
it is the gradient of φ(x, y), the velocity vector V is normal to an equipotential at
any point where V is not the zero vector.
Just as in the case of the flow of heat, the condition that the incompressible
fluid enter or leave an element of volume only by flowing through the boundary of
that element requires that φ(x, y) must satisfy Laplace’s equation
φxx (x, y) + φyy (x, y) = 0
in a domain where the fluid is free from sources or sinks. In view of equations (6)
and the continuity of the functions p and q and their first-order partial derivatives, it
follows that the partial derivatives of the first and second order of φ are continuous in
such a domain. Hence the velocity potential φ is a harmonic function in that domain.

114. THE STREAM FUNCTION
According to Sec. 113, the velocity vector
(1)

V = p(x, y) + iq(x, y)

for a simply connected domain in which the flow is irrotational can be written
(2)

V = φx (x, y) + iφy (x, y) = grad φ(x, y),

where φ is the velocity potential. When the velocity vector is not the zero vector, it
is normal to an equipotential passing through the point (x, y). If, moreover, ψ(x, y)
denotes a harmonic conjugate of φ(x, y) (see Sec. 104), the velocity vector is tangent
to a curve ψ(x, y) = c2 . The curves ψ(x, y) = c2 are called the streamlines of the
flow, and the function ψ is the stream function. In particular, a boundary across
which fluid cannot flow is a streamline.
The analytic function
F (z) = φ(x, y) + iψ(x, y)
is called the complex potential of the flow. Note that
F  (z) = φx (x, y) + iψx (x, y)
and, in view of the Cauchy–Riemann equations,
F  (z) = φx (x, y) − iφy (x, y).
Expression (2) for the velocity thus becomes
(3)

V = F  (z).

The speed, or magnitude of the velocity, is obtained by writing
|V | = |F  (z)|.

According to equation (5), Sec. 104, if φ is harmonic in a simply connected
domain D, a harmonic conjugate of φ there can be written
(x,y)

ψ(x, y) =

−φt (s, t) ds + φs (s, t) dt,

(x0 ,y0 )

where the integration is independent of path. With the aid of equations (6), Sec. 113,
we can, therefore, write
ψ(x, y) =

(4)

−q(s, t) ds + p(s, t) dt,
C

where C is any contour in D from (x0 , y0 ) to (x, y).
Now it is shown in advanced calculus that the right-hand side of equation (4)
represents the integral with respect to arc length σ along C of the normal component VN (x, y) of the vector whose x and y components are p(x, y) and q(x, y),
respectively. So expression (4) can be written
ψ(x, y) =

(5)

VN (s, t) dσ.
C

Physically, then, ψ(x, y) represents the time rate of flow of the fluid across C.
More precisely, ψ(x, y) denotes the rate of flow, by volume, across a surface of
unit height standing perpendicular to the xy plane on the curve C.
EXAMPLE. When the complex potential is the function
F (z) = Az ,

(6)

where A is a positive real constant,
φ(x, y) = Ax

(7)

and ψ(x, y) = Ay.

The streamlines ψ(x, y) = c2 are the horizontal lines y = c2 /A, and the velocity at
any point is
V = F  (z) = A.
Here a point (x0 , y0 ) at which ψ(x, y) = 0 is any point on the x axis. If the
point (x0 , y0 ) is taken as the origin, then ψ(x, y) is the rate of flow across any
contour drawn from the origin to the point (x, y) (Fig. 157). The flow is uniform
and to the right. It can be interpreted as the uniform flow in the upper half plane
bounded by the x axis, which is a streamline, or as the uniform flow between two
parallel lines y = y1 and y = y2 .

Flows Around a Corner and Around a Cylinder

395

The stream function ψ characterizes a definite flow in a region. The question of
whether just one such function exists corresponding to a given region, except possibly for a constant factor or an additive constant, is not examined here. Sometimes,
when the velocity is uniform far from the obstruction or when sources and sinks
are involved (Chap. 11), the physical situation indicates that the flow is uniquely
determined by the conditions given in the problem.
A harmonic function is not always uniquely determined, even up to a constant
factor, by simply prescribing its values on the boundary of a region. In the example
above, the function ψ(x, y) = Ay is harmonic in the half plane y > 0 and has
zero values on the boundary. The function ψ1 (x, y) = Bex siny also satisfies those
conditions. However, the streamline ψ1 (x, y) = 0 consists not only of the line y = 0
but also of the lines y = nπ (n = 1, 2, . . .). Here the function F1 (z) = Bez is the
complex potential for the flow in the strip between the lines y = 0 and y = π, both
lines making up the streamline ψ(x, y) = 0 ; if B > 0, the fluid flows to the right
along the lower line and to the left along the upper one.

115. FLOWS AROUND A CORNER AND AROUND
A CYLINDER
In analyzing a flow in the xy, or z, plane, it is often simpler to consider a corresponding flow in the uv, or w, plane. Then, if φ is a velocity potential and ψ a
stream function for the flow in the uv plane, results in Secs. 105 and 106 can be
applied to these harmonic functions. That is, when the domain of flow Dw in the
uv plane is the image of a domain Dz under a transformation
w = f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y),
where f is analytic, the functions
φ[u(x, y), v(x, y)]

and ψ[u(x, y), v(x, y)]

are harmonic in Dz . These new functions may be interpreted as velocity potential and
stream function in the xy plane. A streamline or natural boundary ψ(u, v) = c2 in the
uv plane corresponds to a streamline or natural boundary ψ[u(x, y), v(x, y)] = c2 in
the xy plane.
In using this technique, it is often most efficient to first write the complex
potential function for the region in the w plane and then obtain from that the
velocity potential and stream function for the corresponding region in the xy plane.
More precisely, if the potential function in the uv plane is
F (w) = φ(u, v) + iψ(u, v),
the composite function
F [f (z)] = φ[u(x, y), v(x, y)] + iψ[u(x, y), v(x, y)]
is the desired complex potential in the xy plane.

In order to avoid an excess of notation, we use the same symbols F, φ, and ψ
for the complex potential, etc., in both the xy and the uv planes.
EXAMPLE 1. Consider a flow in the first quadrant x > 0, y > 0 that comes in
downward parallel to the y axis but is forced to turn a corner near the origin, as shown in
Fig. 158. To determine the flow, we recall (Example 3, Sec. 13) that the transformation
w = z2 = x 2 − y 2 + i2xy
maps the first quadrant onto the upper half of the uv plane and the boundary of the
quadrant onto the entire u axis.
y

O

x

FIGURE 158

From the example in Sec. 114, we know that the complex potential for a
uniform flow to the right in the upper half of the w plane is F = Aw, where A is
a positive real constant. The potential in the quadrant is, therefore,
(1)

F = Az2 = A(x 2 − y 2 ) + i2Axy;

and it follows that the stream function for the flow there is
(2)

ψ = 2Axy.

This stream function is, of course, harmonic in the first quadrant, and it vanishes
on the boundary.
The streamlines are branches of the rectangular hyperbolas
2Axy = c2 .
According to equation (3), Sec. 114, the velocity of the fluid is
V = 2Az = 2A(x − iy).
Observe that the speed
|V | = 2A x 2 + y 2
of a particle is directly proportional to its distance from the origin. The value of the
stream function (2) at a point (x, y) can be interpreted as the rate of flow across a
line segment extending from the origin to that point.
EXAMPLE 2. Let a long circular cylinder of unit radius be placed in a
large body of fluid flowing with a uniform velocity, the axis of the cylinder being

perpendicular to the direction of flow. To determine the steady flow around the
cylinder, we represent the cylinder by the circle x 2 + y 2 = 1 and let the flow distant
from it be parallel to the x axis and to the right (Fig. 159). Symmetry shows that
points on the x axis exterior to the circle may be treated as boundary points, and
so we need to consider only the upper part of the figure as the region of flow.

CHAPTER

11
THE SCHWARZ–CHRISTOFFEL
TRANSFORMATION

In this chapter, we construct a transformation, known as the Schwarz–Christoffel
transformation, which maps the x axis and the upper half of the z plane onto a
given simple closed polygon and its interior in the w plane. Applications are made
to the solution of problems in fluid flow and electrostatic potential theory.

116. MAPPING THE REAL AXIS ONTO A POLYGON
We represent the unit vector which is tangent to a smooth arc C at a point z0 by
the complex number t, and we let the number τ denote the unit vector tangent to
the image  of C at the corresponding point w0 under a transformation w = f (z).
We assume that f is analytic at z0 and that f  (z0 ) = 0. According to Sec. 101,
(1)

arg τ = arg f  (z0 ) + arg t.

In particular, if C is a segment of the x axis with positive sense to the right, then
t = 1 and arg t = 0 at each point z0 = x on C. In that case, equation (1) becomes
(2)

arg τ = arg f  (x).

If f  (z) has a constant argument along that segment, it follows that arg τ is constant.
Hence the image  of C is also a segment of a straight line.
Let us now construct a transformation w = f (z) that maps the whole x axis
onto a polygon of n sides, where x1 , x2 , . . . , xn−1 , and ∞ are the points on that
axis whose images are to be the vertices of the polygon and where
x1 < x2 < · · · < xn−1 .

The vertices are the n points wj = f (xj ) (j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1) and wn = f (∞).
The function f should be such that arg f  (z) jumps from one constant value to
another at the points z = xj as the point z traces out the x axis (Fig. 165).

If the function f is chosen such that
(3)

f  (z) = A(z − x1 )−k1 (z − x2 )−k2 · · · (z − xn−1 )−kn−1 ,

where A is a complex constant and each kj is a real constant, then the argument of
f  (z) changes in the prescribed manner as z describes the real axis. This is seen by
writing the argument of the derivative (3) as
(4)

arg f  (z) = arg A − k1 arg(z − x1 )
− k2 arg(z − x2 ) − · · · − kn−1 arg(z − xn−1 ).

When z = x and x < x1 ,
arg(z − x1 ) = arg(z − x2 ) = · · · = arg(z − xn−1 ) = π.
When x1 < x < x2 , the argument arg(z − x1 ) is 0 and each of the other arguments
is π. According to equation (4), then, arg f  (z) increases abruptly by the angle k1 π
as z moves to the right through the point z = x1 . It again jumps in value, by the
amount k2 π, as z passes through the point x2 , etc.
In view of equation (2), the unit vector τ is constant in direction as z moves
from xj −1 to xj ; the point w thus moves in that fixed direction along a straight line.
The direction of τ changes abruptly, by the angle kj π, at the image point wj of
xj , as shown in Fig. 165. Those angles kj π are the exterior angles of the polygon
described by the point w.
The exterior angles can be limited to angles between −π and π, in which case
−1 < kj < 1. We assume that the sides of the polygon never cross one another and
that the polygon is given a positive, or counterclockwise, orientation. The sum of
the exterior angles of a closed polygon is, then, 2π; and the exterior angle at the
vertex wn , which is the image of the point z = ∞, can be written
kn π = 2π − (k1 + k2 + · · · + kn−1 )π.

Thus the numbers kj must necessarily satisfy the conditions

−1 < kj < 1

(j = 1, 2, . . . , n).

Note that kn = 0 if
k1 + k2 + · · · + kn−1 = 2.

(6)

This means that the direction of τ does not change at the point wn . So wn is not a
vertex, and the polygon has n − 1 sides.
The existence of a mapping function f whose derivative is given by
equation (3) will be established in the next section.

factors (z − xj )−kj (j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1) represent branches of power functions with
branch cuts extending below that axis. To be specific, write
(z − xj )−kj = exp[−kj log(z − xj )] = exp[−kj (ln |z − xj | + iθj )]
and then

where θj = arg(z − xj ) and j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. This makes f  (z) analytic everywhere in the half plane y ≥ 0 except at the n − 1 branch points xj .
If z0 is a point in that region of analyticity, denoted here by R, then the function

To define the function F at the point z = x1 so that it is continuous there, we
note that (z − x1 )−k1 is the only factor in expression (1) that is not analytic at x1 .
Hence if φ(z) denotes the product of the rest of the factors in that expression, φ(z)
is analytic at the point x1 and is represented throughout an open disk |z − x1 | < R1

f  (z) = φ(x1 )(z − x1 )−k1 + (z − x1 )1−k1 ψ(z),

where ψ is analytic and therefore continuous throughout the entire open disk. Since
1 − k1 > 0, the last term on the right in equation (4) thus represents a continuous
function of z throughout the upper half of the disk, where Im z ≥ 0, if we assign it
the value zero at z = x1 . It follows that the integral
 z
(s − x1 )1−k1 ψ(s) ds

of that last term along a contour from Z1 to z , where Z1 and the contour lie in the
half disk, is a continuous function of z at z = x1 . The integral

along the same path also represents a continuous function of z at x1 if we define
the value of the integral there as its limit as z approaches x1 in the half disk. The
integral of the function (4) along the stated path from Z1 to z is, then, continuous
at z = x1 ; and the same is true of integral (3) since it can be written as an integral
along a contour in R from z0 to Z1 plus the integral from Z1 to z.
The above argument applies at each of the n − 1 points xj to make F continuous throughout the region y ≥ 0.
From equation (1), we can show that for a sufficiently large positive number
R, a positive constant M exists such that if Im z ≥ 0, then

Since 2 − kn > 1, this order property of the integrand in equation (3) ensures the
existence of the limit of the integral there as z tends to infinity; that is, a number
Wn exists such that

is the Schwarz–Christoffel transformation, named in honor of the two German mathematicians H. A. Schwarz (1843–1921) and E. B. Christoffel (1829–1900) who
discovered it independently.
Transformation (7) is continuous throughout the half plane y ≥ 0 and is conformal there except for the points xj . We have assumed that the numbers kj satisfy

conditions (5), Sec. 116. In addition, we suppose that the constants xj and kj are
such that the sides of the polygon do not cross, so that the polygon is a simple closed
contour. Then, according to Sec. 116, as the point z describes the x axis in the positive direction, its image w describes the polygon P in the positive sense; and there is
a one to one correspondence between points on that axis and points on P . According
to condition (6), the image wn of the point z = ∞ exists and wn = Wn + B.
If z is an interior point of the upper half plane y ≥ 0 and x0 is any point on the
x axis other than one of the xj , then the angle from the vector t at x0 up to the line
segment joining x0 and z is positive and less than π (Fig. 165). At the image w0 of
x0 , the corresponding angle from the vector τ to the image of the line segment joining x0 and z has that same value. Thus the images of interior points in the half plane
lie to the left of the sides of the polygon, taken counterclockwise. A proof that the
transformation establishes a one to one correspondence between the interior points
of the half plane and the points within the polygon is left to the reader (Exercise 3).
Given a specific polygon P , let us examine the number of constants in the
Schwarz–Christoffel transformation that must be determined in order to map the x
axis onto P . For this purpose, we may write z0 = 0, A = 1, and B = 0 and simply
require that the x axis be mapped onto some polygon P  similar to P . The size
and position of P  can then be adjusted to match those of P by introducing the
appropriate constants A and B.
The numbers kj are all determined from the exterior angles at the vertices of P .
The n − 1 constants xj remain to be chosen. The image of the x axis is some polygon
P  that has the same angles as P . But if P  is to be similar to P , then n − 2 connected
sides must have a common ratio to the corresponding sides of P ; this condition is
expressed by means of n − 3 equations in the n − 1 real unknowns xj . Thus two of
the numbers xj , or two relations between them, can be chosen arbitrarily, provided
those n − 3 equations in the remaining n − 3 unknowns have real-valued solutions.
When a finite point z = xn on the x axis, instead of the point at infinity,
represents the point whose image is the vertex wn , it follows from Sec. 116 that the
Schwarz–Christoffel transformation takes the form
 z
w=A
(8)
(s − x1 )−k1 (s − x2 )−k2 · · · (s − xn )−kn ds + B,
z0

where k1 + k2 + · · · + kn = 2. The exponents kj are determined from the exterior
angles of the polygon. But, in this case, there are n real constants xj that must
satisfy the n − 3 equations noted above. Thus three of the numbers xj , or three
conditions on those n numbers, can be chosen arbitrarily when transformation (8)
is used to map the x axis onto a given polygon.

1. Obtain inequality (5), Sec. 117.
Suggestion: Let R be larger than the numbers |xj | (j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1). Note
that if R is sufficiently large, the inequalities |z|/2 < |z − xj | < 2|z| hold for each xj
when |z| > R. Then use expression (1), Sec. 117, along with conditions (5), Sec. 116.

2. Use condition (5), Sec. 117, and sufficient conditions for the existence of improper
integrals of real-valued functions to show that F (x) has some limit Wn as x tends

integral of f  (z) over each arc of a semicircle |z| = R (Im z ≥ 0) approaches 0 as R

3. According to Sec. 86, the expression

positively oriented simple closed contour C when g(z) = 0 on C and when C lies in
a simply connected domain D throughout which g is analytic and g  (z) is never zero.
In that expression, write g(z) = f (z) − w0 , where f (z) is the Schwarz–Christoffel
mapping function (7), Sec. 117, and the point w0 is either interior to or exterior to
the polygon P that is the image of the x axis ; thus f (z) = w0 . Let the contour C
consist of the upper half of a circle |z| = R and a segment −R < x < R of the x axis
that contains all n − 1 points xj , except that a small segment about each point xj is
replaced by the upper half of a circle |z − xj | = ρj with that segment as its diameter.

the mapping of the half plane Im z > 0 onto the interior of P is one to one.

118. TRIANGLES AND RECTANGLES
The Schwarz–Christoffel transformation is written in terms of the points xj and not
in terms of their images, which are the vertices of the polygon. No more than three
of those points can be chosen arbitrarily; so, when the given polygon has more than

three sides, some of the points xj must be determined in order to make the given
polygon, or any polygon similar to it, be the image of the x axis. The selection of
conditions for the determination of those constants that are convenient to use often
requires ingenuity.
Another limitation in using the transformation is due to the integration that
is involved. Often the integral cannot be evaluated in terms of a finite number
of elementary functions. In such cases, the solution of problems by means of the
transformation can become quite involved.
If the polygon is a triangle with vertices at the points w1 , w2 , and w3 (Fig. 166),
the transformation can be written
 z
w=A
(1)
(s − x1 )−k1 (s − x2 )−k2 (s − x3 )−k3 ds + B,
z0

where k1 + k2 + k3 = 2. In terms of the interior angles θj ,
kj = 1 −

θj
π

(j = 1, 2, 3).

Here we have taken all three points xj as finite points on the x axis. Arbitrary
values can be assigned to each of them. The complex constants A and B, which are
associated with the size and position of the triangle, can be determined so that the
upper half plane is mapped onto the given triangular region.

where arbitrary real values can be assigned to x1 and x2 .
The integrals in equations (1) and (2) do not represent elementary functions
unless the triangle is degenerate with one or two of its vertices at infinity. The
integral in equation (2) becomes an elliptic integral when the triangle is equilateral or when it is a right triangle with one of its angles equal to either π/3
or π/4.

The image of the point z = 1 is clearly w = 0 ; that is, w2 = 0. If z = −1 in

x + 1 > 0 and

arg(x + 1) = 0,

but the form (8) of the integrand indicates more clearly the appropriate branches of
the power functions involved.
EXAMPLE 2. Let us locate the vertices of the rectangle when a > 1. As
shown in Fig. 168, x1 = −a, x2 = −1, x3 = 1, and x4 = a. All four vertices can

119. DEGENERATE POLYGONS
We now apply the Schwarz–Christoffel transformation to some degenerate polygons
for which the integrals represent elementary functions. For purposes of illustration, the
examples here result in transformations that we have already seen in Chap. 8.
EXAMPLE 1.

Let us map the half plane y ≥ 0 onto the semi-infinite strip
π
π
− ≤ u ≤ , v ≥ 0.

We consider the strip as the limiting form of a triangle with vertices w1 , w2 , and

We choose the points x1 = −1, x2 = 1, and x3 = ∞ as the points whose images
are the vertices. Then the derivative of the mapping function can be written
dw
= A(z + 1)−1/2 (z − 1)−1/2 = A (1 − z2 )−1/2 .
dz
Hence w = A sin−1 z + B. If we write A = 1/a and B = b/a, it follows that
z = sin(aw − b).
This transformation from the w to the z plane satisfies the conditions z = −1
when w = −π/2 and z = 1 when w = π/2 if a = 1 and b = 0. The resulting transformation is
z = sin w,
which we verified in Example 1, Sec. 96, as one that maps the strip onto the half
plane.
EXAMPLE 2. Consider the strip 0 < v < π as the limiting form of a rhombus with vertices at the points w1 = πi, w2 , w3 = 0, and w4 as the points w2 and

w4 are moved infinitely far to the left and right, respectively (Fig. 170). In the limit,
the exterior angles become
k1 π = 0,

k2 π = π,

k3 π = 0,

k4 π = π.

We leave x1 to be determined and choose the values x2 = 0, x3 = 1, and x4 = ∞.
The derivative of the Schwarz–Christoffel mapping function then becomes
dw
A
= A(z − x1 )0 z−1 (z − 1)0 = ;

thus
w = A Log z + B.

Now B = 0 because w = 0 when z = 1. The constant A must be real because
the point w lies on the real axis when z = x and x > 0. The point w = πi is the
image of the point z = x1 , where x1 is a negative number ; consequently,
πi = A Log x1 = A ln |x1 | + A πi.
By identifying real and imaginary parts here, we see that |x1 | = 1 and A = 1. Hence
the transformation becomes
w = Log z ;
also, x1 = −1. We already know from Example 3 in Sec. 95 that this transformation
maps the half plane onto the strip.
The procedure used in these two examples is not rigorous because limiting values
of angles and coordinates were not introduced in an orderly way. Limiting values were
used whenever it seemed expedient to do so. But if we verify the mapping obtained, it
is not essential that we justify the steps in our derivation of the mapping function. The
formal method used here is shorter and less tedious than rigorous methods.

6. Refer to Fig. 26, Appendix 2. As the point z moves to the right along the negative
real axis, its image point w is to move to the right along the entire u axis. As z
describes the segment 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 of the real axis, its image point w is to move to the
left along the half line v = π i (u ≥ 1); and, as z moves to the right along that part of
the positive real axis where x ≥ 1, its image point w is to move to the right along the
same half line v = π i (u ≥ 1). Note the changes in direction of the motion of w at
the images of the points z = 0 and z = 1. These changes suggest that the derivative
of a mapping function should be
f  (z) = A(z − 0)−1 (z − 1),
where A is some constant ; thus obtain formally the mapping function
w = π i + z − Log z,
which can be verified as one that maps the half plane Re z > 0 as indicated in the
figure.
7. As the point z moves to the right along that part of the negative real axis where
x ≤ −1, its image point is to move to the right along the negative real axis in the w
plane. As z moves on the real axis to the right along the segment −1 ≤ x ≤ 0 and
then along the segment 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, its image point w is to move in the direction of
increasing v along the segment 0 ≤ v ≤ 1 of the v axis and then in the direction of
decreasing v along the same segment. Finally, as z moves to the right along that part

respectively. Thus verify that the polygon is regular and is centered at w = 0.

120. FLUID FLOW IN A CHANNEL THROUGH A SLIT
We now present a further example of the idealized steady flow treated in Chap. 10,
an example that will help show how sources and sinks can be accounted for in
problems of fluid flow. In this and the following two sections, the problems are
posed in the uv plane, rather than the xy plane. That allows us to refer directly to
earlier results in this chapter without interchanging the planes.
Consider the two-dimensional steady flow of fluid between two parallel planes
v = 0 and v = π when the fluid is entering through a narrow slit along the line
in the first plane that is perpendicular to the uv plane at the origin (Fig. 172). Let
the rate of flow of fluid into the channel through the slit be Q units of volume
per unit time for each unit of depth of the channel, where the depth is measured
perpendicular to the uv plane. The rate of flow out at either end is, then, Q/2.
The transformation w = Log z is a one to one mapping of the upper half y > 0
of the z plane onto the strip 0 < v < π in the w plane (see Example 2 in Sec. 119).

The inverse transformation

z = ew = eu eiv

maps the strip onto the half plane (see Example 3, Sec. 14). Under transformation (1), the image of the u axis is the positive half of the x axis, and the image of
the line v = π is the negative half of the x axis. Hence the boundary of the strip is
transformed into the boundary of the half plane.
The image of the point w = 0 is the point z = 1. The image of a point w = u0 ,
where u0 > 0, is a point z = x0 , where x0 > 1. The rate of flow of fluid across a
curve joining the point w = u0 to a point (u, v) within the strip is a stream function
ψ(u, v) for the flow (Sec. 114). If u1 is a negative real number, then the rate of
flow into the channel through the slit can be written
ψ(u1 , 0) = Q.
Now, under a conformal transformation, the function ψ is transformed into a function of x and y that represents the stream function for the flow in the corresponding
region of the z plane; that is, the rate of flow is the same across corresponding
curves in the two planes. As in Chap. 10, the same symbol ψ is used to represent
the different stream functions in the two planes. Since the image of the point w = u1
is a point z = x1 , where 0 < x1 < 1, the rate of flow across any curve connecting
the points z = x0 and z = x1 and lying in the upper half of the z plane is also equal
to Q. Hence there is a source at the point z = 1 equal to the source at w = 0.
The same argument applies in general to show that under a conformal transformation, a source or sink at a given point corresponds to an equal source or sink
at the image of that point.
As Re w tends to −∞, the image of w approaches the point z = 0. A sink of
strength Q/2 at the latter point corresponds to the sink infinitely far to the left in
the strip. To apply the argument in this case, we consider the rate of flow across a
curve connecting the boundary lines v = 0 and v = π of the left-hand part of the
strip and the rate of flow across the image of that curve in the z plane.
The sink at the right-hand end of the strip is transformed into a sink at infinity
in the z plane.
The stream function ψ for the flow in the upper half of the z plane in this case
must be a function whose values are constant along each of the three parts of the x

axis. Moreover, its value must increase by Q as the point z moves around the point
z = 1 from the position z = x0 to the position z = x1 , and its value must decrease
by Q/2 as z moves about the origin in the corresponding manner. We see that the

Also, the point w = πi is a stagnation point; that is, the velocity is zero there.

121. FLOW IN A CHANNEL WITH AN OFFSET
To further illustrate the use of the Schwarz–Christoffel transformation, let us find
the complex potential for the flow of a fluid in a channel with an abrupt change in
its breadth (Fig. 173). We take our unit of length such that the breadth of the wide
part of the channel is π units; then hπ, where 0 < h < 1, represents the breadth of
the narrow part. Let the real constant V0 denote the velocity of the fluid far from
the offset in the wide part ; that is,
lim V = V0 ,

u→−∞

where the complex variable V represents the velocity vector. The rate of flow per
unit depth through the channel, or the strength of the source on the left and of the
sink on the right, is then
Q = πV0 .

The cross section of the channel can be considered as the limiting case of the
quadrilateral with the vertices w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 shown in Fig. 173 as the first
and last of these vertices are moved infinitely far to the left and right, respectively.
In the limit, the exterior angles become

As before, we proceed formally, using limiting values whenever it is convenient to

0 < x2 < 1, the derivative of the mapping function becomes
(2)

dw

To simplify the determination of the constants A and x2 here, we proceed at
once to the complex potential of the flow. The source of the flow in the channel
infinitely far to the left corresponds to an equal source at z = 0 (Sec. 120). The

entire boundary of the cross section of the channel is the image of the x axis. In
view of equation (1), then, the function
(3)

F = V0 Log z = V0 ln r + iV0 θ

is the potential for the flow in the upper half of the z plane, with the required source
at the origin. Here the stream function is ψ = V0 θ . It increases in value from 0 to
V0 π over each semicircle z = Reiθ (0 ≤ θ ≤ π) as θ varies from 0 to π. [Compare
with equation (5), Sec. 114, and Exercise 8, Sec. 115.]
The complex conjugate of the velocity V in the w plane can be written
V (w) =

At the limiting position of the point w1 , which corresponds to z = 0, the velocity is the real constant V0 . So it follows from equation (4) that
V0 =

At the limiting position of w4 , which corresponds to z = ∞, let the real number V4
denote the velocity. Now it seems plausible that as a vertical line segment spanning
the narrow part of the channel is moved infinitely far to the right, V approaches V4
at each point on that segment. We could establish this conjecture as a fact by first
finding w as the function of z from equation (2); but, to shorten our discussion, we
assume that this is true, Then, since the flow is steady,
πhV4 = πV0 = Q,
or V4 = V0 / h. Letting z tend to infinity in equation (4), we find that

From equation (6), we know that the magnitude |V | of the velocity becomes
infinite at the corner w3 of the offset since it is the image of the point z = 1. Also,
the corner w2 is a stagnation point, a point where V = 0. Hence, along the boundary
of the channel, the fluid pressure is greatest at w2 and least at w3 .
To write the relation between the potential and the variable w, we must integrate
equation (2), which can now be written

1 − s2

consequently,
(9)

s2 =

exp(F /V0 ) − 1

By substituting s from this equation into equation (8), we obtain an implicit relation
that defines the potential F as a function of w.

The cross section of that region in the uv plane has the limiting form of
the quadrilateral bounded by the dashed lines in Fig. 174 as the points w1 and
w3 move out to the right and w4 to the left. In applying the Schwarz–Christoffel
transformation here, we let the point x4 , corresponding to the vertex w4 , be the point
at infinity. We choose the points x1 = −1, x3 = 1 and leave x2 to be determined.
The limiting values of the exterior angles of the quadrilateral are

and so the transformation of the upper half of the z plane into the divided strip in
the w plane has the form
(1)

w=

[(1 + x2 ) Log (z + 1) + (1 − x2 ) Log (z − 1)] + B.
2

Let A1 , A2 and B1 , B2 denote the real and imaginary parts of the constants A
and B. When z = x, the point w lies on the boundary of the divided strip ; and,
according to equation (1),
(2)

u + iv =

A1 + iA2
{(1 + x2 )[ln |x + 1| + i arg(x + 1)]
2
+ (1 − x2 )[ln |x − 1| + i arg(x − 1)]} + B1 + iB2 .

To determine the constants here, we first note that the limiting position of the
line segment joining the points w1 and w4 is the u axis. That segment is the image
of the part of the x axis to the left of the point x1 = −1; this is because the line
segment joining w3 and w4 is the image of the part of the x axis to the right of
x3 = 1, and the other two sides of the quadrilateral are the images of the remaining

two segments of the x axis. Hence when v = 0 and u tends to infinity through
positive values, the corresponding point x approaches the point z = −1 from the
left. Thus
arg(x + 1) = π,
arg(x − 1) = π,
and ln|x + 1| tends to −∞. Also, since −1 < x2 < 1, the real part of the quantity
inside the braces in equation (2) tends to −∞. Since v = 0, it readily follows that
A2 = 0 ; for, otherwise, the imaginary part on the right would become infinite. By
equating imaginary parts on the two sides, we now see that
0=

A1
[(1 + x2 )π + (1 − x2 )π] + B2 .
2

Hence
(3)

−πA1 = B2 ,

A2 = 0.

The limiting position of the line segment joining the points w1 and w2 is the
half line v = π/2 (u ≥ 0). Points on that half line are images of the points z = x,
where −1 < x ≤ x2 ; consequently,
arg(x + 1) = 0,

arg(x − 1) = π.

Identifying the imaginary parts on the two sides of equation (2), we thus arrive at
the relation
(4)

π
A1
=
(1 − x2 )π + B2 .
2
2

Finally, the limiting positions of the points on the line segment joining w3 to
w4 are the points u + πi, which are the images of the points x when x > 1. By
identifying, for those points, the imaginary parts in equation (2), we find that
π = B2 .
Then, in view of equations (3) and (4),
A1 = −1,

x2 = 0.

Thus x = 0 is the point whose image is the vertex w = πi/2 ; and, upon substituting
these values into equation (2) and identifying real parts, we see that B1 = 0.
Transformation (1) now becomes
(5)

w = − [Log (z + 1) + Log (z − 1)] + πi,

INTEGRAL FORMULAS
OF THE POISSON TYPE

In this chapter, we develop a theory that enables us to solve a variety of boundary
value problems whose solutions are expressed in terms of definite or improper
integrals. Many of the integrals occurring are then readily evaluated.

123. POISSON INTEGRAL FORMULA
Let C0 denote a positively oriented circle, centered at the origin, and suppose that
a function f is analytic inside and on C0 . The Cauchy integral formula (Sec. 50)

f (z) =

expresses the value of f at any point z interior to C0 in terms of the values of f
at points s on C0 . In this section, we shall obtain from formula (1) a corresponding
formula for the real component of the function f ; and, in Sec. 124, we shall use
that result to solve the Dirichlet problem (Sec. 105) for the disk bounded by C0 .
We let r0 denote the radius of C0 and write z = r exp(iθ ), where 0 < r < r0
(Fig. 177). The inverse of the nonzero point z with respect to the circle is the
point z1 lying on the same ray from the origin as z and satisfying the condition
|z1 ||z| = r02 . Because (r0 /r) > 1,

Poisson Integral Formula

The quantity |s − z| is the distance between the points s and z , and the law of
cosines can be used to write (see Fig. 177)
(5)

|s − z|2 = r02 − 2r0 r cos(φ − θ ) + r 2 .

Hence, if u is the real component of the analytic function f , it follows from formula (4) that

(6)
dφ
(r < r0 ).
u(r, θ ) =
2π 0 r02 − 2r0 r cos(φ − θ ) + r 2
This is the Poisson integral formula for the harmonic function u in the open disk
bounded by the circle r = r0 .
Formula (6) defines a linear integral transformation of u(r0 , φ) into u(r, θ ).
The kernel of the transformation is, except for the factor 1/(2π), the real-valued
function
(7)

P (r0 , r, φ − θ ) =

r02 − r 2
,
r02 − 2r0 r cos(φ − θ ) + r 2

which is known as the Poisson kernel. In view of equation (5), we can also write
(8)

P (r0 , r, φ − θ ) =

r02 − r 2
;
|s − z|2

and, since r < r0 , it is clear that P is a positive function. Moreover, since z/(s − z)
and its complex conjugate z/(s − z) have the same real parts , we find from the
second of equations (3) that

Thus P (r0 , r, φ − θ ) is a harmonic function of r and θ interior to C0 for each fixed
s on C0 . From equation (7), we see that P (r0 , r, φ − θ ) is an even periodic function
of φ − θ , with period 2π, and that its value is 1 when r = 0.
The Poisson integral formula (6) can now be written
 2π

u(r, θ ) =
(10)
P (r0 , r, φ − θ )u(r0 , φ) dφ
(r < r0 ).

 2π

(11)
P (r0 , r, φ − θ ) dφ = 1
(r < r0 ).
2π 0
We have assumed that f is analytic not only interior to C0 but also on C0 itself
and that u is, therefore, harmonic in a domain which includes all points on that
circle. In particular, u is continuous on C0 . The conditions will now be relaxed.

124. DIRICHLET PROBLEM FOR A DISK
Let F be a piecewise continuous function (Sec. 38) of θ on the interval 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π.
The Poisson integral transform of F is defined in terms of the Poisson kernel
P (r0 , r, φ − θ ), introduced in Sec. 123, by means of the equation
 2π
1
U (r, θ ) =
(1)
P (r0 , r, φ − θ )F (φ) dφ
(r < r0 ).
2π 0
In this section, we shall prove that the function U (r, θ ) is harmonic inside the
circle r = r0 and
lim U (r, θ ) = F (θ )

(2)

r→r0
r<r0

for each fixed θ at which F is continuous. Thus U is a solution of the Dirichlet
problem for the disk r < r0 in the sense that U (r, θ ) approaches the boundary value
F (θ ) as the point (r, θ ) approaches (r0 , θ ) along a radius, except at the finite number
of points (r0 , θ ) where discontinuities of F may occur.
EXAMPLE. Before proving the statement in italics, let us apply it to find
the potential V (r, θ ) inside a long hollow circular cylinder of unit radius, split
lengthwise into two equal parts, when V = 1 on one of the parts and V = 0 on
the other. This problem was solved by conformal mapping in Sec. 112 ; and we
recall how it was interpreted there as a Dirichlet problem for the disk r < 1, where
V = 0 on the upper half of the boundary r = 1 and V = 1 on the lower half. (See
Fig. 178.)

where the stated restriction on the values of the arctangent function is physically
evident. When expressed in rectangular coordinates, the solution here is the same
as solution (5) in Sec. 112.
We turn now to the proof that the function U defined in equation (1) satisfies the
Dirichlet problem for the disk r < r0 , as asserted just prior to this example. First of
all, U is harmonic inside the circle r = r0 because P is a harmonic function of r and
θ there. More precisely, since F is piecewise continuous, integral (1) can be written
as the sum of a finite number of definite integrals each of which has an integrand that
is continuous in r, θ , and φ. The partial derivatives of those integrands with respect
to r and θ are also continuous. Since the order of integration and differentiation with
respect to r and θ can, then, be interchanged and since P satisfies Laplace’s equation
r 2 Prr + rPr + Pθθ = 0
in the polar coordinates r and θ (Exercise 5, Sec. 26), it follows that U satisfies
that equation too.
In order to verify limit (2), we need to show that if F is continuous at θ , there
corresponds to each positive number ε a positive number δ such that
(6)

|U (r, θ ) − F (θ )| < ε

whenever

0 < r0 − r < δ.

Integral Formulas of the Poisson Type

We start by referring to property (11), Sec. 123, of the Poisson kernel and writing
 2π
1
U (r, θ ) − F (θ ) =
P (r0 , r, φ − θ ) [F (φ) − F (θ )] dφ.
2π 0
For convenience, we let F be extended periodically, with period 2π, so that the
integrand here is periodic in φ with that same period. Also, we may assume that
0 < r < r0 because of the nature of the limit to be established.
Next, we observe that since F is continuous at θ , there is a small positive
number α such that
ε
|F (φ) − F (θ )| <
(7)
whenever
|φ − θ | ≤ α.

Evidently,
(8)

U (r, θ ) − F (θ ) = I1 (r) + I2 (r)

The fact that P is a positive function (Sec. 123), together with the first of
inequalities (7) just above and property (11), Sec. 123, of that function, enables us
to write

As for the integral I2 (r), one can see from Fig. 177 in Sec. 123 that the denominator |s − z|2 in expression (8) for P (r0 , r, φ − θ ) in that section has a (positive)
minimum value m as the argument φ of s varies over the closed interval
θ + α ≤ φ ≤ θ − α + 2π.
So, if M denotes an upper bound of the piecewise continuous function |F (φ) − F (θ )|
on the interval 0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π, it follows that

whenever r0 − r < δ, where δ is the positive number defined by equation (9). That

125. RELATED BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS
Details of proofs of results given in this section are left to the exercises. The function
F representing boundary values on the circle r = r0 is assumed to be piecewise
continuous.
Suppose that F (2π − θ ) = −F (θ ). The Poisson integral transform (1) in Sec.
124 then becomes
 π

U (r, θ ) =
(1)
[P (r0 , r, φ − θ ) − P (r0 , r, φ + θ )]F (φ) dφ.
2π 0
This function U has zero values on the horizontal radii θ = 0 and θ = π of the circle,
as one would expect when U is interpreted as a steady temperature. Formula (1)
thus solves the Dirichlet problem for the semicircular region r < r0 , 0 < θ < π,
where U = 0 on the diameter AB shown in Fig. 180 and

The analytic function z = r02 /Z maps the circle |Z| = r0 in the Z plane onto
the circle |z| = r0 in the z plane, and it maps the exterior of the first circle onto the

Formula (7) is known as the Schwarz integral formula, or the Poisson integral
formula for the half plane. In the next section, we shall relax the conditions for the
validity of formulas (7) and (8).

127. DIRICHLET PROBLEM FOR A HALF PLANE
Let F denote a real-valued function of x that is bounded for all x and continuous
except for at most a finite number of finite jumps. When y ≥ ε and |x| ≤ 1/ε, where
ε is any positive constant, the integral
 ∞
F (t) dt
I (x, y) =

−∞ (t − x) + y
converges uniformly with respect to x and y, as do the integrals of the partial
derivatives of the integrand with respect to x and y. Each of these integrals is
the sum of a finite number of improper or definite integrals over intervals where
F is continuous; hence the integrand of each component integral is a continuous
function of t, x, and y when y ≥ ε. Consequently, each partial derivative of I (x, y)

is represented by the integral of the corresponding derivative of the integrand whenever y > 0.
If we write
y
U (x, y) = I (x, y),
π
then U is the Schwarz integral transform of F , suggested by expression (7),

Except for the factor 1/π, the kernel here is y/|t − z|2 . It is the imaginary component
of the function 1/(t − z), which is analytic in z when y > 0. It follows that the kernel
is harmonic, and so it satisfies Laplace’s equation in x and y. Because the order
of differentiation and integration can be interchanged, the function (1) then satisfies
that equation. Consequently, U is harmonic when y > 0.
To prove that
lim U (x, y) = F (x)

for each fixed x at which F is continuous, we substitute t = x + y tan τ in integral (1) and write

As a consequence, if
G(x, y, τ ) = F (x + y tan τ ) − F (x)
and α is some small positive constant,

G(x, y, τ ) dτ = I1 (y) + I2 (y) + I3 (y)

If M denotes an upper bound for |F (x)|, then |G(x, y, τ )| ≤ 2M. For a given
positive number ε, we select α so that 6Mα < ε; and this means that

and
|I3 (y)| ≤ 2Mα < .

We next show that corresponding to ε, there is a positive number δ such that
ε
|I2 (y)| <
whenever
0 < y < δ.

To do this, we observe that since F is continuous at x, there is a positive number
γ such that
ε
|G(x, y, τ )| <
whenever 0 < y| tan τ | < γ .
3π
Now the maximum value of | tan τ | as τ ranges from

Hence, if we write δ = γ tan α, it follows that

|I2 (y)| <

whenever 0 < y < δ.
3π
3
We have thus shown that
|I1 (y)| + |I2 (y)| + |I3 (y)| < ε

whenever 0 < y < δ.

Condition (2) now follows from this result and equation (4).
Formula (1) therefore solves the Dirichlet problem for the half plane y > 0,
with the boundary condition (2). It is evident from the form (3) of expression (1)
that |U (x, y)| ≤ M in the half plane, where M is an upper bound of |F (x)|; that is,
U is bounded. We note that U (x, y) = F0 when F (x) = F0 , where F0 is a constant.
According to formula (8) of Sec. 126, under certain conditions on F the function

1 ∞ (x − t)F (t)
V (x, y) =
(5)
dt
(y > 0)
π −∞ (t − x)2 + y 2
is a harmonic conjugate of the function U given by formula (1). Actually, formula (5) furnishes a harmonic conjugate of U if F is everywhere continuous, except
for at most a finite number of finite jumps, and if F satisfies an order property
|x a F (x)| < M

(a > 0).

For, under those conditions, we find that U and V satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann
equations when y > 0.
Special cases of formula (1) when F is an odd or an even function are left to
the exercises.

As in Sec. 123 and Fig. 177, we write

and z = r exp(iθ )

(r < r0 ).

When s is fixed, the function
(1)

Q(r0 , r, φ − θ ) = −2r0 ln|s − z| = −r0 ln[r02 − 2r0 r cos(φ − θ ) + r 2 ]

is harmonic interior to the circle |z| = r0 because it is the real component of
−2 r0 log(z − s),
where the branch cut of log(z − s) is an outward ray from the point s. If, moreover,

These observations suggest that the function Q may be used to write an integral
representation for a harmonic function U whose normal derivative Ur on the circle
r = r0 assumes prescribed values G(θ ).
If G is piecewise continuous and U0 is an arbitrary constant, the function
 2π

(3)
Q(r0 , r, φ − θ ) G(φ) dφ + U0

is harmonic because the integrand is a harmonic function of r and θ . If the mean
value of G over the circle |z| = r0 is zero, so that

G(φ) dφ = 0,

then, in view of equation (2),

Hence
(5)

When G is piecewise continuous and satisfies condition (4), the formula

(6) U (r, θ ) = −
ln[r02 − 2r0 r cos(φ − θ ) + r 2 ] G(φ) dφ + U0 (r < r0 ),
2π 0
therefore, solves the Neumann problem for the region interior to the circle r = r0 ,
where G(θ ) is the normal derivative of the harmonic function U (r, θ ) at the boundary in the sense of condition (5). Note how it follows from equations (4) and (6) that
since ln r02 is constant, U0 is the value of U at the center r = 0 of the circle r = r0 .
The values U (r, θ ) may represent steady temperatures in a disk r < r0 with
insulated faces. In that case, condition (5) states that the flux of heat into the
disk through its edge is proportional to G(θ ). Condition (4) is the natural physical requirement that the total rate of flow of heat into the disk be zero, since
temperatures do not vary with time.
A corresponding formula for a harmonic function H in the region exterior to
the circle r = r0 can be written in terms of Q as

Turning now to a half plane, we let G(x) be continuous for all real x, except
possibly for a finite number of finite jumps, and let it satisfy an order property
(9)

|x a G(x)| < M

(a > 1)

when −∞ < x < ∞. For each fixed real number t, the function Log|z − t| is harmonic in the half plane Im z > 0. Consequently, the function

(12)

lim Uy (x, y) = G(x)

at each point x where G is continuous.
Integral formula (10) evidently solves the Neumann problem for the half plane
y > 0, with boundary condition (12). But we have not presented conditions on
G which are sufficient to ensure that the harmonic function U is bounded as |z|
increases.
When G is an odd function, formula (10) can be written
