Preface

This little book is a revised and expanded version of one I wrote for the "VIII
Latin-American School of Mathematics" [29], in Portuguese, based on which
I have periodically taught a topics course over the last 18 years. As the title suggests, it is an introductory text. It is addressed to graduate students
of mathematics in the area of differential equations/nonlinear analysis and
to mathematicians in other areas who would like to have a first exposure
to so-called variational methods and their applications to PDEs and ODEs.
Afterwards, the reader can choose from some excellent and more comprehensive texts, which already exist in the literature but require somewhat more
maturity in the area.
We present a cross-section of the area of variational methods, with a minimum (no "pun" intended) of material, but clearly illustrating through one or
two examples each of the results that we have chosen to present. So, besides
the first motivating chapter and an appendix, there are only ten short chapters
(with three or, at most, four sections each) through which the reader is quickly
exposed to a few basic aspects of the beautiful area of variational methods
and applications to differential equations. In fact, the reader may initially
skip some of the more technical proofs of the main theorems, concentrating
instead on the applications that are given.
Chapter 1 is of a motivating nature where we present five simple ODE
problems which, from a variational point of view, illustrate existence results
in situations of "minima" and "minimax," as well as a nonexistence result in
a situation of resonance. In fact, to whet the reader's appetite, we present
through some sketches a sneak preview of the geometry of each of the five
functionals associated with the given problems. This chapter sets the stage
for the topics to be covered in the following chapters: minimization, deformation results, the mountain-pass theorem, the saddle-point theorem, critical
points under constraints, a duality principle, critical points in the presence of
symmetries, and problems in which there is lack of compactness. At the end
of Chapters 2 through 6 we provide a few exercises to the reader.

Preface

Of course there were a number of other important topics that were not
covered in this little book. Our main goal, we emphasize, was to offer the
reader a sampling of topics in critical point theory serving as a stepping stone
to a number of excellent and comprehensive texts which exist in the literature,
such as [63] (1986) by P. Rabinowitz, [55] (1989) by J. Mawhin and M. Willem,
[69] (1990) by M. Struwe, and [75] (1996) by M. Willem.

Introduction

It is fortunate (for some of us) that many differential equation problems
D(u) == 0
can be handled by variational techniques, in other words, by considering an
associated real-valued junction
cp:X---+IR,
whose derivative is equal to D( u), and by looking for points of minimum,
maximum or minimax (e.g., saddle-like) of ip, so that our given problem reads
cp' (u) == 0 or Dcp(u) == D(u) == 0 .

1 Five Illustrating Problems
Let us start by illustrating our statement through the following five ordinary
differential equation problems:
u" + 1.2 u == sin t ' O<t<n
{ u(O) == u(n) == 0
u' + u == sin t, 0 < t < n
{ u(O) == u(n) == 0
u'' + 2u == sin t, 0 < t < n
{ u(O) == u(n) == 0

u" - u 3 == 0, 0 < t < n
{ u(O) == u(n) == 0

2

1 Introduction

u" + u 3 == 0, 0 < t < 1r
{ u(O) == u(1r) == 0
Except for 5), the following statements about these problems are clear:
1) Problem (PI) has the solution Uo (t) == - 2 sin t (unique);
2) Problem (P2 ) has no solution;
3) Problem (P3 ) has the solution uo(t) == sin t (unique);
4) Problem (P4 ) has the solution Uo (t) == 0 (unique);
5) Problem (Ps ) has the solution Uo (t) == 0 (not unique).
Indeed, statements 1),2) and 3) are easily checked through elementary
methods of solution for second order linear differential equations. Also, the
fact that uo(t) == 0 is a solution of both (P4 ) and (Ps ) is obvious, whereas the
fact that (P4 ) has no other solution can be seen by multiplying the equation
by u and integrating by parts. We then obtain

and it readily follows that u(t) == o. What is not so obvious (unless one uses,
for instance, a phase-plane analysis) is that Problem (Ps ) has other solutions
besides u(t) == 0, in fact infinitely many of them.
Now, let us note that each of the Problems (PI) - (Ps ) is of the form

u" + f(u) == p(t) , 0 < t < 1r
{ u(O) == u(1r) == 0

(P)

where f(8) == ~8, 8, 28, -8 3,83 (respectively) and p(t) == sint, sint, sint, 0, 0
(respectively). And, if Uo (t) is a solution, then by multiplying the equation by
an arbitrary smooth function h(t) satisfying h(O) == h(1r) == 0 and integrating
by parts, we obtain

The informal treatment above and the zero boundary condition imposed

At this point, a question that naturally arises is the following:
Question. What type of critical point is each solution Uo presented earlier?
What is the geometry of the functional cp in each problem (PI) - (Ps )?
Among other topics, the present monograph will answer this and other
related questions. It turns out that, in problems (PI) and (P4 ) , the solution
UQ is a global minimum of cp, whereas UQ is a local minimum of cp in problem
(Ps ) . The (nonobvious) nonzero solutions of (Ps ) mentioned earlier turn out
to be minimax points u of cp which can be obtained through the celebrated
mountain-pass theorem of Ambrosetti and Rabinowitz, and the symmetric
mountain-pass theorem of Rabinowitz [63]. On the other hand, the solution
Uo (t) == sin t in problem (P 3 ) turns out to be a minimax critical point of ip
which could be obtained through the saddle-point theorem of Rabinowitz [63].
We provide below a sneak preview of an answer to our question through some
pictures (Note: The 3D-picture assigned to Problem (Ps ) is somewhat misleading, as the corresponding functional is not bounded from above; keep in

mind that all functionals are defined on an infinite-dimensional space). Incident ally, the fact that the linear problem (Pz ) has no solution (as indicat ed
by th e slant ed trough in the pictures below) is simply due to th e resonant
nature of that problem, as th e coefficient Al = 1 of u on th e left-hand side
of (Pz ) is an eigenvalue (th e first) of u" + AU = 0, u(O) = u(n) = O. As
it is well known (from the Fredholm alternative), an additional condition is
needed for u" + AIU = p(t) , u(O) = u(n) = 0 to have a solution , namely,
Jo"' p(t) sintdt = 0 must hold. The right-hand side p(t) = sint of (Pz) clearly
violates this condit ion! As we shall see in Chapter 5 (also Chapter 11), th ere
are corresponding conditions for nonlinear problems which were first introduced by Landesman and Lazer in [49] .

Critical Points Via Minimization

1 Basic Results
One of the most basic minimization problems one can pose is the following:
Given a functional .p : E ~ JR. on a Hilbert space E and a closed,
convex subset C c E on which .p is bounded from below, find iu, E C
such that

.p(uo) == inf rp (u) .
uEC

Of course, the problem as stated is much too general and one should be careful
and make additional hypotheses! Nowadays, any good calculus student is
aware of the fact that a function rp : JR. ~ JR. which is bounded from below
on a closed interval C c JR. does not necessarily attain its infimum in C.
In fact, in learning the classic Weierstrass theorem, the student might have

discovered that this delicate question of attaining the infimum is intimately
connected to "continuity" of the functional rp and "compactness" of the set
C! More precisely, the result that follows is well known and standard in a
first course on Topology. For that, we recall that a functional .p : X ~ IR on
a topological space X is lower-semicontinuous (I. s. c.) if rp-l (a, (0) is open in
X for any a E JR. (that is, rp-l (-00, a] is closed in X for any a E JR.). And if
X satisfies the first countability axiom (for example, if X is a metric space),
then ip : X ~ JR. is l.s.c. if and only if rp(u) ~ liminfrp(u n ) for any u E X
and sequence Un converging to ii.

Theorem 1.1. Let X be a compact topological space and rp : X ~ JR. a
lower-semicontinuous functional. Then rp is bounded from below and there
exists Uo E X such that
rp( uo) == inf rp .
x

8

2 Critical Points Via Minimization

Proof:

We can clearly write X

== U~lCP-l(-n,oo). Since, by hypothesis,

each set cp-l(-n, 00) is open and X is compact, it follows that
no

X ==

U cp-l(-n, oo)
n=l

for some no EN, hence cp( u) > -no for all u EX, so that .p is bounded
from below. Now, let c == inf x .p > -00 and suppose, by contradiction, that

cp(u) > c for all u E X. Then,

X ==

1
Ucp-l(C+ -,00)
n
00

n=l

and, again, by compactness of X, there exists kEN such that cp( u) > c + 1I k

for all u E X, hence c 2:: c + 11k, which is absurd. Therefore, the infimum c

D

must be attained.

Next, given a Hilbert space E and a functional cp : E ---+ lR, we recall
that ip is weakly l.s. c. if it is l.s.c. considering E with its weak topology:
in other words, cp(u) :S liminfcp(u n ) whenever Un converges weakly to u
(written u., ~ u)l. As a consequence of Theorem 1.1, we obtain the following
important result which represents a synthesis of the so-called "direct method
of the calculus of variations" .

Theorem 1.2. Let E be a Hilbert space (or, more generally, a reflexive Banach space) and suppose that a functional cp : E ---+ lR is

(i) weakly lower-semicontinuous (weakly l.s.c.),
(ii) coercive (that is, cp( u) ---+ +00 as Ilull ----t 00).
Then .p is bounded from below and there exists Uo E E such that
cp( uo) == inf cp .
E

Proof:

By the coercivity hypothesis (ii), choose R > 0 such that cp(u) 2:: cp(O)

for all u E E with Ilull 2:: R. Since the closed ball BR (of radius R and center
at 0) is compact in the weak topology and, by (i), cp : B R ---+ lR is l.s.c. in

the weak topology, Theorem 1.1 implies the existence of Uo E BR such that
cp( uo) == inf Bn sp, hence cp( uo) == inf E cp by the choice of R.

Remark 1.1. In addition to the above conditions, if the given functional
rp : E -----t IR is differentiable, then any point Uo of minimum is a critical
point of ip, that is, rp' (uo) == 0 E E*. This follows from a standard calculus
argument (which the reader is invited to recall).
As another consequence of Theorem 1.1, we can now state the following
answer to the minimization problem mentioned in the beginning of this section.
Theorem 1.3. Under the hypotheses (i), (ii) of the previous theorem, given
any closed, convex subset C c E there exists il E C such that rp( il) == infc ip,

Proof: The proof is essentially the same as that of the previous theorem,
if we replace 13R 2 by 13 R n C and keep in mind that a closed, convex and
bounded subset of E is (again) weakly compact (cf. [36], sections V.3 and

D

V.4).

Example. Let E be a Hilbert space, a : E x E -----t IR a continuous symmetric
bilinear form satisfying a(u,u) 2:: Qllul1 2 for all u E E (and some Q> 0) and
let l : E -----t IR be a continuous linear functional. Consider the quadratic
functional defined by
1

rp(u) == 2a(u, u) -l(u) ,

uEE .

Then, given any admissible set C (that is, a closed, convex subset C c E),
the classic minimization problem

rp (il) == inf cp (u )
uEC

has a unique solution. In fact, existence of il E C is guaranteed by Theorem 1.3
by noticing that the quadratic functional .p is coercive and, being continuous
and convex, is weakly l.s.c. (see Example B below). Uniqueness follows from
the strict convexity of .p in this case. In the special situation in which a(u, v) ==
(u,v) (the inner product of E), we have
1

<p(u) = 211ul12 - (u,h) ,

uEE ,

(where h E E represents the linear functionall, according to the Riesz-Frechet
representation theorem). By completing the square in the above expression,
that is, by writing rp(u) as
2

Similarly, in this case R > 0 is chosen so that <p(u) ~ <p(p) for all u E C with
IIull ~ R, where pEe is any fixed point.

we see that the point u E C has the geometric characterization of being the
projection of h onto the closed, convex set C, u == Projr-h, In other words,

u E C is such that Ilh - ull ::; Ilh - ull Vu E C.

Example A. If K : E ~ E is a completely continuous operator on a Hilbert
space E, then the functional .p : E ~ JR given below is weakly l.s.c.,
f{J(u)==(Ku,u) ,

uEE.

In fact, sp is weakly continuous since, in this case, K Un ---t K u strongly if
Un ~ u weakly, hence f{J(un) ---t f{J( u) if Un ~ u weakly. When K is a positive
symmetric operator (continuous but not necessarily completely continuous)
the above functional is convex and its lower semicontinuity in the weak topology is then a consequence of its lower semicontinuity, as the next class of
examples shows.

Example B. If ip : E ~ JR is a convex, l.s.c. functional on a reflexive
Banach space E, then f{J is weakly l.s.c.
For the proof it is convenient to introduce the notion of epigraph of ip,
epi(f{J) == {(u, a) E E x JR I f{J (u) < a} .

Then we can use the following easily proven equivalences,
f{J is convex (resp. l.s.c., resp. weakly l.s.c.) if and only if
epi(f{J) is convex (resp. closed, resp. weakly closed),

2 Application to a Dirichlet Problem

and recall the fact that a closed, convex subset of a reflexive Banach space
(E x lR, in this case) is weakly closed.

Example C. Let n c lR N (N 2 1) be a bounded domain and let F : nxlR -----+

lR be a function satisfying the so-called Caratheodory conditions:
(i) F(·, s) is measurable on n for every fixed s E lR,
(ii) F (x, .) is continuous on lR for almost all x E n.
(This implies that the so-called Nemytskii operator u(x) r---+ F(x, u(x)) associated with F is well defined on the space of measurable functions u : n -----+ lR
(cf. [72], Chapter 2.2)).
Now, we show that under a suitable growth condition, namely
There exist a,b > 0 and 1 < a < 2N/(N - 2) if N 2 3 (1 < a < 00 if
N == 1,2) such that
(FI )

IF(x, s)1 ~ alslQ + b ,
the functional 'ljJ given by the formula

'IjJ(u) =

10 F(x, u(x)) dx

is well defined and weakly continuous on the Sobolev space
(n).
Indeed, the main point here is that the Sobolev space
is compactly
embedded in LP for any 1 < p < 2N/ (N - 2), in view of Sobolev embedding
Theorem (cf. [1]) and the growth condition (PI) which implies that the N emytskii operator F maps the space LP, for p 2: a, into the space LP/ in a
continuous manner (cf. the Vainberg theorem in [71]). Therefore, if Un ~ u
weakly in HJ, then Un ----t u strongly in LP (for any 1 ~ p < 2N/(N - 2))
and so, by the continuity of the Nemytskii operator just mentioned, it follows
that F(·, un) ----t F(·, u) strongly in LP/Q, hence strongly in £1 (since 0 is a
bounded domain). In other words, 'ljJ(u n ) ----t 'ljJ(u) whenever Un ~ u weakly

where 0 c lR N (N ~ 1) is a bounded domain and I : 0 x lR ~ lR is a
Caratheodory function (that is, a function satisfying the Caratheodory conditions stated in the previous section).
We shall be interested in finding weak solutions of (P), that is, functions
U E HJ(O) such that

L

[\lu . \lh - f(x, u)h] dx = 0 'r/ h E HJ (0) .

(2.1)

For that, we introduce the growth condition
There exist c, d > 0 and 0 ~ a < (N + 2)/(N - 2) if N ~ 3 (0 < a < 00 if
N == 1,2) such that

II(x, s)1 ~ clslCT + d
and start by proving the following basic result.
Proposition 2.1. Let I : 0 x lR ~ lR be a Caraiheodon; function satisfying
I(x, r) tlr, the functional
condition (11)' Then, letting F(x, s) ==

cp'(u)·h= L[\lU.\lh-f(x,U)h] dx=O

'r/u,hEHJ(O).

(2.2)

(Therefore, U E HJ is a weak solution of (P) if and only if U is a critical point
of <p.)
Proof:
norm

We shall always consider the Sobolev space HJ endowed with the

Ilull = (LI\lu I2dx)1/2 ,

which is equivalent to the usual norm (11ulli2 + II\7uIII2 )1/2 in view of Poincare
inequality,
where Al > 0 is the first eigenvalue of the problem -~u == AU in 0, u == 0 on

an (cf. Exercise 3.5). Therefore, we may write
cp(u) = ~lluW - 'lj;(u) , 'lj;(u) =

L

and it suffices to show that 'ljJ is well defined and 'ljJ E C 1 (HJ , IR) with

1jJ'(u) h =

L

J(x, u)h dx V u, h E HJ(f1)

(2.3)

since the functional q(u) == ~ IIul1 2 is clearly of class Coo with q' (u) . h ==
J\7u· \7h dx == (u, h) Vu, h E HJ . Now, since f is a Caratheodory function
satisfying (f1)' it easily follows that F is also a Caratheodory function and it
satisfies the condition (F1 ) of the previous section (Example C). Therefore,
'ljJ : HJ ----+ IR is well defined and weakly l.s.c.
In order to show the differentiability of 'ljJ, let u E HJ be fixed and define

8(h) = 1jJ(u + h) -1jJ(u) Then

where r == 2N/ (N + 2) and s == 2N/ (N - 2). (Here, we only consider the case
N 2:: 3. The cases N == 1,2 must be treated separately.) Now, in view of the
continuous Sobolev embedding
'---7 LS, we have that (u + th) ----t u in LS as

above). We have thus shown that 'ljJ : HJ ----+ IR is (Frechet.) differentiable at
any u E HJ with derivative 'ljJ'(u) given by (2.3).

Finally, in order to verify the continuity of 'ljJ' : HJ ~ (HJ) * == H- 1 , we
again use the Holder inequality, Sobolev embedding and the Vainberg theorem
as above to obtain

Remark 2.1. Let us denote by VJcp : HJ ~ HJ the gradient of ip, which is
defined via the Riesz-Frechet representation theorem, that is, VJ cp( u) E HJ is
the unique element such that cp' (u) . h == (h, VJ cp( u)) for all h E HJ. Then,
it follows from (2.2), (2.3) that VJ cp( u) == u - T( u), where T : HJ ~ HJ,
T(u) == VJ'ljJ(u), is a compact operator. Indeed, if Un ~ u weakly in HJ, then
Un ---+ u strongly in LSI for any 81 with 1 ~ 81 < 8 == 2N/(N - 2), in view
of the compact Sobolev embedding HJ L-+ LSI. Therefore, fixing 81 so that

a + 1 ~ 81 < 8 and arguing as in (2.5), we obtain

IIT(un ) - T(u)11 == 11'ljJ'(u n ) - 'ljJ'(u)IIH-I

f(·,u)IILrI ~ 0

We are now in a position to prove the following existence result for problem (P) :
Theorem 2.2. Suppose that f : 0 X IR ~ IR is a Caratheodory function

satisfying conditions (fl) and (f2), where
There exists f3 < Al such that lim sUPlsl~oo !(:,s) < f3
uniformly for x E o.

(f2)

Then problem (P) has a weak solution u E HJ (0).
Proof: In view of Proposition 2.1, we shall find a critical point of the functional cp E C 1 (HJ , IR ) given by
r.p(u) = ~llul12 - 'ljJ(u)

'ljJ(u) =

F(x, u) dx .

As we know, q(u) == !llul12 is weakly l.s.c. and ts is weakly continuous (cf.
Example C of the previous section). Therefore, it follows that

The Deformation Theorem

1 Preliminaries
Let .p : X -----t JR be a 0 1 functional on a Banach space X. A number c E JR
is called a critical value of .p if <.p(u) == c for some critical point u EX. The
set of all critical points at the level c is denoted by K c:

K; == {u E X I <.p' (u) == 0, <.p(u) == c} .
Also, we shall denote by <.pc the set of all points in X at levels :::; c, that is,
<.pc == {u E X I <.p(u) :::; c} .

A basic ingredient in the topological methods is the so-called deformation
theorem. Roughly, it says when (and how) we can deform <.pCl into ({JC2, for
C1 > C2 (or C1 < C2). Since X is not a Hilbert space in general and since we
are only assuming <.p to be of class C 1 , we shall need to use the notion of a
pseudo-gradient, due to Palais [60].

Definition 1. A pseudo-gradient field for <.p E C 1 (X, JR) is a locally Lipschitzian mapping v : Y -----t X, where Y == {u E XI<.p'(U) # O}, satisfying the
following conditions:

1\ v(u) II < 211 <.p' (u) II

(1.1)

<.p' (u) . v (u) ~ II <.p' (u) 11 2

(1.2)

for all u E Y. In what follows we shall use the fact that any functional
<.p E C1(X, JR) has a pseudo-gradient (see a proof in [75]).

20

3 The Deformation Theorem

If X is a Hilbert space and .p E 0 1 (X, lR) has a locally Lipschitzian
derivative <.p' : X --+ X*, then the gradient of sp (when restricted to Y),
\7<.p : Y --+ X, is clearly a pseudo-gradient for ip, (Recall that \7<.p : X --+ X
is defined through the Riesz-Frechet representation theorem: \7<.p(u) E X is
the unique element verifying ip' (u) . h == (h, \7<.p(u)) for all u EX.)

2 Some Versions of the Deformation Theorem
There are versions of the deformation theorem due to Palais [60, 59] and
Clark [25], among others. In all those versions the functional <.p is assumed to
satisfy some compactness condition. Here, we shall be interested in Clark's
versions, which will be stated for the general case of a Banach space X.
Our presentation follows [74] (cf. also [75]), where the starting point is a
quantitative version of the deformation theorem without a Palais-Smale type
condition on .p, a result due to Willem [74].
Theorem 2.1. Let <.p : X --+ lR be a 0 1 functional on a Banach space X.
Let 8 C X, c E lR and c, 6 > 0 be such that

4£

11<p'(u)11 ~ 8"

(2.1)

for all u E <p-1 [c - 2£, C + 2£] n 8 2 8 . 1 Then, there exists a continuous mapping
TJ E C([O, 1] x X, X) such that, for any u E X and t E [0,1] one has:

(i) 77(0, u) == u,
(ii) 77(t, u) == u if u ~ <.p-1[C - 2£, C + 2£] n 8 28 ,
(iii) 77(1, <.pC+E n 8) C <.pC-E n 8 8 ,
(iv) 77(t,·) : X --+ X is a homeomorphism.
Proof:

Let A == <.p-1[C - 2£,c + 2£] n 8 28, B == <p-1[C - e.c + £] n 88 and

Y == {u E X I <p' (u) :f. O}, so that B cAe Y. Also, let v : Y --+ X be a
pseudo-gradient for .p and consider a locally Lipschitzian mapping p : X --+ lR
such that 0 < p < 1 and
p == 1 in B
{ p == 0 in X\A.

Then, define the following locally Lipschitzian mapping f : X --+ X,
v(u)

f( u) = -p( u) Ilv(u) II .

> 0, we let Sa denote the closed a-neighborhood of
S defined by Sa == {u E X I dist(u, S) ::; a}.

has (for each given u E X) a unique solution defined for all t 2': 0. Let
7] : [0,1] x X ----+ X be defined by

7](t , u) = w(<5t, u) .
Then, it is easy to see that (i), (ii) and (iv) are satisfied. In order to verify

where we have used (1.2) in the first inequality above. Now, let U E epC+E n S
be given. We have two cases to consider.

(a) If cp(w(i, u)) < C - E for some i E [0,8), then cp(1](l, u)) == cp(w(8, u)) ~
cp(w(i,u)) < c- E, hence 1](l,u) E cpC-E n58 in view of (2.2).

(b) In the other case we have w(t, u) E cp-l [c - E, C + E] n 58 == B Vt E [0,8],
and so, using (2.3), (1.1) and the fact that p == 1 on B, we obtain

cp(w(8,u)) = cp(u) + (Ii dd cp(w(t,u)) dt ~ cp(u) _ (Ii ~llcp'(w(t,u))11 dt

where the assumption (2.1) was used in the last inequality. Therefore, in
either case (a) or (b), we have shown that 1](1, u) == w(8, u) E cpC-E n 58 if
U E epC+E n S. The proof is complete
D
As a consequence of Theorem 2.1 we obtain the following first version of
the deformation theorem, due to Clark [25].
Theorem 2.2. Let .p E 0 1 (X, IR) satisfy the Palais-Smale condition:

Any sequence (un) such that cp( un) is bounded and cp' (un) ---+
possesses a convergent subsequence.

°

°

(PS)

If C E IR is not a critical value of ip, then, for every E > sufficiently small,
there exists 1] E 0([0,1] x X, X) such that, for any u E X and t E [0,1] one
has:

(i) 1](0, u) == u,
(ii) 1](t, u) == u if u ~ cp-l [c - 2E, C + 2E],
(iii) 1](1, cpC+E) c cpC-E,
(iv) 1](t,·): X ~ X is a homeomorphism.

°

Proof: There must exist constants a, {3 > such that II cp' (u) II 2: (3 whenever
u E cp-l [c - 2a, c + 2a] since, otherwise, one would have a sequence (un)
satisfying
c-

.!.n ~ cp( un) ~ c +.!.n , Ilcp' (un) II ~ .!.n ,

so that, in view of the condition (P5), the value c would be a critical value
of ep, contradicting our assumption.

Now, the result follows from Theorem 2.1 with S == X, E E (0, a] given
and 8 == 4E/{3.

Fig. 3.2.

Remark 2.1. It is clear from the above proof that Theorem 2.2 holds true under the following weaker compactness condition introduced by Brezis-CoronNirenberg in [18]:

If a sequence (un) is such that cp( un) ---t c and cp' (un) ---t 0 then c is a
critical value of cpo
(BCN)c
This condition may be useful in certain situations where the functional
.p is not coercive, as we shall see in the next section. For now, as a simple
example, we observe that a function cp : JR. ----t JR. which is periodic does not
satisfy (P 8), but it satisfies (BC N) c for every c E JR..
Next, let us consider a second (more general) version of the deformation

theorem, also due to Clark [25].
Theorem 2.3. Let cp E C1(X,JR) satisfy the Palais-Smale condition (PS).
Given c E JR and an open neighborhood U of K c ' then, for any E > 0 sufficiently small, there exists TJ E C([O, 1] x X, X) such that (for any u E X and
t E [0,1]):

(i) TJ(O, u) == u,
(ii) TJ(t, u) == u if u ~ cp-l[c - 2E, C + 2E],
(iii) TJ(l, cpC+E\U) c cpC-E,
(iv) TJ(t,·): X ----t X is a homeomorphism.
Let S == X\U. Then there must exist E,6 > 0 such that Ilcp'(u)11 2:
4E/6 wherever u E cp-l [c- 2E, C + 2E] n 8 2 8 since, otherwise, one would have a
Proof:

sequence (un) satisfying

24

3 The Deformation Theorem

Then, in view of the condition (PS), one would have a convergent subsequence
u n k ---+ U, with U E S n Ki: But this is a contradiction, since S == X\U and
K; C U. Therefore, the result follows from Theorem 2.1.
D
Remark 2.2. We should note that the Palais-Smale condition (PS) implies
that the (possibly empty) critical set K c == {u E X I rp' (u) == 0 , rp( u) == c} is
a compact set. In the case K; == 0 (i.e., c is not a critical value), we can take
U == 0 in Theorem 2.3 and obtain Theorem 2.2.

3 A Minimum Principle and an Application
As a first application of the theorem of deformation, let us now obtain an
important minimum principle, which can be useful in situations where the
functional rp is not coercive (compare with Theorem 2.1.2).
Theorem 3.1. Let rp E C 1(X, JR) where X is a Banach space. Assume that

(i) rp is bounded from below, c == inf x ip,
(ii) rp satisfies (BCN)c'
Then there exists Uo E X such that ep( uo) == c == inf x ep (hence, c is a critical

value of rp).
Proof: Let us assume, by negation, that c is not a critical value of ip, Then,
Theorem 2.2 implies the existence of E > 0 and TJ E 0([0,1] x X, X) satisfying
TJ (1, cpC+E) C cpc- E. This is a contradiction since cpc-E == 0 (as c == inf x cp). D

This situation is the PDE analog of that considered in [74, Section II] for the
forced pendulum.
We are interested in finding weak solutions of (3.1), in other words, functions u E HI (n) satisfying

L vt. [\lu·

f(u)h - ph] dx = 0

(3.3)

for all h E Hl(O). Here, the Sobolev space Hl(O) is equipped with its usual
inner product

(u, v) =

L + v« .

and we will consider the functional ~ given by the formula

cp(u) =
where, again, F(s) ==

(3.4)

Proposition 3.2. The functional ~ : Hl(O) ----+ ~ given above is well defined. Moreover, ~ is bounded from below and is of class 0 1 with

cp'(u) . h =

L

[\lu· \lh - f(u)h - ph] dx

(3.5)

for all u, h E Hl(O) (Therefore, u E HI is a weak solution of (3.1) if and only
if u is a critical point of ~).
Proof: Since the continuous function f : IR ----+ IR is p-periodic and satisfies
(3.2), it follows that F : IR ----+ IR is also p-periodic, so that IF(s)1 S A for
some A > 0 and .p is well defined on HI (0) (More generally, and in a similar
manner to Proposition 2.2.1, the functional ~ will be well defined on H 1(O)
provided that I : 0 x IR ----+ IR is a Caratheodory function satisfying the
growth condition (11).)
Now, in order to show that ~ is bounded from below, we decompose X ==
1(0)
H
as
X==XOEBXI ,
where Xl == IR == span{1} is the subspace of constant functions and X o ==
(span {1})1- == { v E X I In v dx == 0 } is the space of functions in HI (0)
with mean-value zero. Also, we observe that the following Poincare inequality
holds for functions in X o, where c is a positive constant (cf. Exercise 5 below):

so that, in view of (3.6),

for some constants C, D > 0, which shows that .p is bounded from below.
Finally, we omit the proof that <p E C 1 (H 1 (0), JR) with the derivative
D
given by (3.5) since it is analogous to that of Proposition 2.2.1.

Remark 3.1. Again, as in Remark 2.2.1, the gradient mapping \7<p : H 1 --+
H 1 is of the form \7<p(u) == u - T(u), where T : H 1 --+ H 1 is a compact
operator.
Theorem 3.3. Assume (3.2) with f E C(JR, JR) a p-periodic function and p E
£2(0, JR). Then Problem (3.1) has a weak solution u E H 1(0).

Proof: In view of the previous proposition, we shall find a critical point of
the functional ~ E 0 1 (HI, lR?) given in (3.4). To start, since (3.2) implies
that F is p-periodic and
pdx == 0, we note that the functional ~ is also
p-periodic, that is,
~(u + p) == ~(u) VuE HI .

In

Next, we claim that
.p satisfies (BCN)c for all c E JR .

Indeed, let (un) be such that ~(un) ~ c and ip'(un) ~ O. Write Un == V n + W n
with V n E X o and ui; E Xl == JR. From (3.7) and the boundedness of <p(u n ) ,
it follows that II\7 V n II L2 is bounded, hence (vn ) is bounded in HI in view of
the Poincare inequality (3.6):

(3.8)
On the other hand, letting wn E [O,p) be such that W n == wn(mod p) and
defining Un == V n + Wn , we obtain that

Since Ilunll is bounded, in view of (3.8) and the definition of Wn , we may
assume (passing to a subsequence, if necessary) that Un ~ U weakly in HI,
for some U E HI. And, since Un == \7~(Un) + T(u n ), with T a compact
operator (cf. Remark 3.1), we conclude that

Un ~ 0 + T(u)
strongly in HI, that is,
strongly in HI. Therefore, it follows that ~(u) == c and ~' (u) == 0, so that c
is a critical value of .p and our claim (*) is true.
Finally, in view of (*) and the fact that ip is bounded from below (cf.
(3.7)), we can use Theorem 3.1 to conclude that there exists Uo E HI such
that ~(uo) == infHl .p, hence Uo is a critical point of .p by Remark 2.1.1.

The Mountain-Pass Theorem

1 Critical Points of Minimax Type
Roughly speaking, the basic idea behind the so-called minimax method is the
following:
Find a critical value of a functional .p E C l (X, IR) as a minimax (or
maximin) value c E IR of rp over a suitable class A of subsets of X:
c == inf sup ip ( u) .
AEAuEA

Example A. Perhaps one of the first examples using a minimax technique is
due to E. Fischer (1905) through a well-known minimax characterization of
the eigenvalues of a real, symmetric n x n matrix M (cf. [33], pp. 31 and 47):

Ak ==

inf

sup

{X k - 1 } x-lXk-1,lxl=1

A-k== sup

inf

(Mxlx) ,

{Xk-l} x-lXk-l,lx!=l

(Mxlx).

Here, the eigenvalues are numbered so that A-I ~ ... ~ A-k ~ ... ~ 0 ~
... ~ Ak ~ ... ~ AI. Also we are denoting by (·1·) (resp. I ·1) the usual inner
product (resp. norm) in X == IRn, and by X j C X an arbitrary subspace of
dimension j. It should be noted that a characterization which is dual to the
above characterization also holds true, namely:

A-k == inf

sup

{X k } xEXk,lxl=l

(Mxlx).

30

4 The Mountain-Pass Theorem

Example B. A similar characterization can be obtained for the eigenvalues
of a compact, symmetric operator T : X ----+ X on a Hilbert space X. This
is part of the so-called Hilbert-Schmidt theory.
Example C. A topological analogue of such minimax schemes was developed
by L. Lusternik and L. Schnirelman from 1925 to 1947. This is known as
the (classical) Lusternik-Schnirelman theory. It was originally based on the
topological notion of category Cat (A, X) of a closed subset A of a metric space
X. By definition, Cat (A, X) is the smallest number of closed, contractible
subsets of X which is needed to cover A (see [53, 54]).
In this context, given a functional cp E 0 1 (X, JR.) over, say, a differentiable
Riemannian manifold X, the idea is to show that the following values are
critical values of ip:
Ck

== inf sup cp(x) , k == 1,2, ... ,
AEAkxEA

where A k :== {A c X I A is closed, Cat (A, X) ~ k}. For example, since
Cat i S" , sn) == 2, one obtains, for a given functional sp E 0 1 (sn , lR), that

and, in this case, C1 == inf ip, C2 == sup ip. Of course this gives us no new
information in this case since we know that inf cp and sup .p are attained on
the compact manifold S" and, therefore, are critical values of cp. However,
if 'P E C 1 (sn, IR) is an even functional, one obtains more critical values, as
shown by the following classical theorem due to Lusternik (1930):
Theorem 1.1. ([53]) Let 'P E Cl(sn,IR) be given. If'P is even, then it has
at least (n + 1) distinct poirs: of critical points.

The main idea here is that an even functional on S" can be considered
as a functional on the real projective space lRpn (obtained by identification
of the antipodal points in sn), and the topology of lRpn is much richer than
that of S": In fact, it can be shown that Cat (lRpn, lRpn) == n + 1 (cf. [68]) so
that, in this case, one obtains (n + 1) critical values (possibly repeated):

Another way to interpret Lusternik's multiplicity result is to consider it
as a consequence of the symmetry of the problem (evenness of 'P, in this

Clearly, since ip is even, its critical points occur in pairs.
== Cj+k for some j, k ~ 1, it can be shown that the category of the
critical set K; is at least k + 1.

This question of multiplicity versus symmetry will be tackled in a

future chapter.

2 The Mountain-Pass Theorem
As already mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, the basic idea behind
the minimax method is to minimaximize (or maximinimize) a given functional <.p over a suitable class of subsets of X. In particular, such a suitable
class can be chosen to be invariant under the deformation TJ( t, .) given in the

deformation theorem 3.2.3.
In this section we will present a first illustration of the minimax method
which has proven to be a powerful tool in the attack of many problems on differential equations. It is the celebrated mountain-pass theorem of Ambrosetti
and Rabinowitz [9]:

Theorem 2.1. Let X be a Banach space and .p E C 1 (X, IR) be a functional
satisfying the Polais-Smale condition (PS) (or, more weakly, (BCN)c).3 If

eE X and 0 < r < Ilell are such that

a ==: max{ <.p ( 0), <.p ( e)} <

inf <.p (u) ==: b ,

Ilull=r

(2.1)

then

c == inf sup .p([( t))

,Er tE[O,l]

is a critical value of ep with c 2: b. (Here, T is the set of paths joining the

points 0 and e, that is, r == {[ E 0([0,1], X) I [(0) == 0, [(1) == e}.)

First note that ,([0,1]) n 8Br is nonempty for any given, E r, since
,(0) == 0, ,(I) == e and 0 < r < Ilell by assumption. Therefore,
Proof:

max ep (,(t )) ~ b == inf ep ,

tE[O,l]

BB r

so that c ~ b.
Let us assume, by negation, that c is not a critical value. Then, by the
deformation theorem 3.2.2, there exist 0 < E <
(recall that a < b by (2.1)

b;a

and TJ E C([O, 1] x X,X)) such that

TJ(t, u) == u if u ~ <.p-1([c - 2E, C + 2EJ), t E [0,1] ,
3 Recall Remark 3.2.1.

One could also use (Ce)c (cf. [67]).

Now, by definition of c as an infimum over r, we can choose '"'I E T such that
max .p('"'I (t)) :::; c + t:

tE[O,l]

(2.4)

and define the path ::=y(t) == 7](1, '"'I(t)). In view of (2.2) and the fact that 2t: <

b- a, it follows that : =y E r (indeed, ::=Y(O) == 7](1,0) == 0 and ::=Y(1) == 7](1, e) == e
since <p(0), <p(e) :::; a < b - 2t:). But, then, (2.3) and (2.4) above imply that
max <p(::=Y(t)) :::; c - t: ,

tE[O,l]

which contradicts the definition of c. Therefore, c is a critical value of ip,

D

Remark 2.1. In the case u == 0 is a strict local minimum of <p and 0 -=I e E X
is such that <p(e) :::; <p(O), then Condition 2.1 is clearly satisfied. This situation
is common in many application as we shall see next (in this sense, the rough
Fig. 4.1 is typical).

3 Two Basic Applications
Application A. Let us show that the following nonlinear Dirichlet problem
on a bounded domain n c }R3 with smooth boundary possesses a classical
nontrivial solution:

{

-~u ==

u == 0

on an .

(3.1)

3 Two Basic Applications

33

To begin with, we observe that since f(x, u) == u 3 and 3 < ~~~ == 5, the
functional

cp(u) ==

i

l

l

n 2

4

[-I\7uI 2 - _u 4 ] dx

is well defined and of class CIon the Sobolev space HJ (0.) by Proposition
2.2.1. The critical points of cp are precisely the weak solutions of (3.1).
Lemma 3.1. (a) U == 0 is a strict local minimum of ip;

(b) Given 0 i= v E HJ there exists Po such that cp(Pov) :S o.

Proof:

(a) In view of the Sobolev embedding HJ C £4 we have
1

<p(u) = "2llul12 - 411ullt4 :;;. "2llul12 - Cllul1

hence cp(u) > 0 == cp(O) for all u with 0 < Ilull :S r, for some small r > o.
(b) Letting <5 ==

so that the result follows.

D

Theorem 3.2. ([g}) Problem (3.1) possesses a nontrivial classical solution."

Proof: We shall use the mountain-pass theorem. Since we already know that
sp E C 1(HJ,lR), we now show that sp satisfies (PS).
Let (un) be such that I<P ( un) I :S C, cp' (un) -+ O. Then, for all n sufficiently
large, we have

hence
that is,

1

411unl12 < C+ 411unll .
This implies that Ilu n II is bounded, so that we may assume (by passing to
a subsequence, if necessary) that Un -+ U weakly in HJ. But then, since
\7cp(u) == u - T(u) with T a compact operator (cf. Remark 2.2.1), we obtain
4 In

fact, because of the eveness of the corresponding functional <p and its superquadratic nature, problem (3.1) has infinitely many solutions, as we shall see
later on.

34

4 The Mountain-Pass Theorem

Therefore, Un ---+ 11 strongly in HJ and we have shown that <p satisfies (P S).
Now, Lemma 3.1 allows us to use Theorem 2.1 (with e == Pov) in order to
conclude the existence of a critical point Uo with <p(uo) == c 2: b > 0 == <p(0).
Therefore, Uo is a nontrivial weak solution of (3.1). Moreover, since both an
and f(x, u) == u 3 are smooth, a bootstrap argument shows that Uo is indeed a
classic solution (cf. [2]).

Application B. This next application is a generalization of the previous one.
We consider the nonlinear Dirichlet problem (cf. [9])

{

-~u == f(x, u) in n c IRN
u == 0 on an ,

(3.2)

where n c IRN (N 2: 2) is a bounded smooth domain and, as usual, f :
x IR ~ IR is a Caratheodory function satisfying the growth condition (fl)
before Proposition 2.2.1 in Chapter 2. Moreover, we shall assume the following
conditions:

n

f(x, s) == o(lsl) as s ---+ 0, uniformly in x.
There exist JL > 2 and r > 0 such that

o < J1F (x, s) < sf (x, s ) for Is I 2: r,
uniformly in x (where we recall that F(x, s) ==

J; f(x, T)dT).

Condition (f3) is the so-called superquadraticity condition of Ambrosetti and
Rabinowitz.
As we know, the fact that f is a Caratheodory function satisfying (fl)
implies (cf. Proposition 2.2.1) that the functional

cp(u) =

- F(x,u)] dx
inr [~IV'uI2
2

(3.3)

is well defined and is of class CIon the Sobolev space HJ(n). Next, we prove
an analogue of Lemma 3.1.

Lemma 3.3. (a)u == 0 is a strict local minimum oj ip;
(b) Given 0 i= v E Hli there exists Po such that <p(Pov) ~ o.

Proof: (a) In view of (f2), given c > 0, there exists 8 == 8(c) > 0 such that
If(x, s)1 ~ clsl for all lsi ~ 8, hence

3 Two Basic Applications

35

Now, since the growth condition (11) implies
(3.5)
we combine (3.4) and (3.5) to get
1

IF(x, s)1 ::; -:t=l sI 2 + A,lslo+ 1

"Is E JR, "Ix E O.

(3.6)

Therefore, using (3.6) we obtain

hence

in view of Poincare's inequality Al11ulli2 ~ IIul1 2 and the Sobolev inequality
IlullLa+l ~ cllull (recall that a + 1 < ~~2). Therefore, since we can take
E < Al and assume that a > 1 in (II), the above inequality (3.7) gives
<p(u) > 0 == <p(0) for all u with 0 < Ilull ~ r, for some suitably small r > o.

(b) It is easy to see that condition (13), together with (II), implies that F
is superquadratic in the sense that there exist constants c, d > 0 such that

F(x, s) 2: clslJ.L - d Vs E JR., Vx E Q.

(3.8)

Therefore,

so that, given v E Hfj with /lvll == 1 and writing 6 == cllvllifL > 0, we obtain

In particular, there exists Po > 0 such that <p(Pov) :S O.

D

Remark 3.1. As we have just seen in part (b) of Lemma 3.3, condition (13)
implies (3.8) with JL > 2 (F is superquadratic) and, hence, <p(pv) ---+ -00 as
p ---+ 00 for any given 0 =F v E HJ. Therefore, the functional <p is not bounded

36

4 The Mountain-Pass Theorem

from below. On the other hand, since <p(u) == ~ IIul1 2 - 'ljJ(u) where 'ljJ is a
weakly continuous functional (recall Example C in Section 2.1 of Chapter
2), then if we let (en) denote an orthonormal basis for HJ, it follows that
limn~oo 'ljJ(Re n ) == 0 for any given R > 0, so that limn~oo <p(Re n ) == ~R2.
Since R > 0 is arbitrary, we see that .p is also not bounded from above.
Theorem 3.4. ([9]) If f : 0 x IR ----t IR is a Caratheodory function satisfying
conditions (fl) - (f3), then problem (3.2) possesses a nontrivial weak solution

u E HJ.

Proof: As in Theorem 3.2, we start by showing that the functional <p given
in (3.3) satisfies the (PS) condition.

Let (un) be such that I<p (Un) I < C, <p' (Un) - t o. Then, for all n sufficiently
large, we have

hence

that is,
1

(-2 - -!.) II u-, 11 < C + -!.II Un II ,

JL

JL

where (~ - ~) > 0, which implies that Ilun II is bounded. The rest of the
proof that <p satisfies (PS) is done as in Theorem 3.2. Similarly, Lemma 3.3
and Theorem 2.1 imply the existence of a nontrivial weak solution Uo E HJ
of (3.2).
D

Remark 3.2. If f : "0 x IR ----t IR is assumed to be locally Lipschitzian, then
by a bootstrap argument, the weak solution Uo is a classical solution (see [9]).
Remark 3.3. We point out that the Palais-Smale condition is a compactness
condition involving both the functional and the space X in a combined manner. The fact that X is infinite dimensional plays no role in requiring that
(PS) (or some other compactness condition) be satisfied in the mountain-pass
theorem. Indeed, even in a finite-dimensional space, the geometric conditions
alone are not sufficient to guarantee that the level c is a critical level (see
Exercise 2 that follows).

The Saddle-Point Theorem

1 Preliminaries. The Topological Degree
In this chapter we present a second important illustration of the minimax
method, the saddle-point theorem of Rabinowitz [64]. Since its proof uses the
topological degree of Brouwer, we reserve this section for a brief presentation
of this important topological tool and its main properties. The interested
reader can see the details in [57].

in U. This can be done in certain cases by using the so-called Brouwer degree

of the mapping <I> (with respect to U, at the point b), denoted by deg(<P, U, b),
which is an integer representing an algebraic count of the number of solutions
of (1.1).
First, we consider the regular case, in which <P E C 1 (U, IRn) and b E

(iii) (Additivity) If U == U1 U U2 , U1 n U2 == 0 and b ~ <I>(aU1) U <I> (aU2 ) , then

(vi) (Boundary Dependence) If \II == <I> on au, then deg( W, U, b) == deg( <I>, U, b).
Remark 1.1. It is not hard to verify properties (i)-(iv), whereas (v) and
(vi) are consequences of (iv). In fact, (iv) implies that the function t ~
deg(H(t, .), U, b) is continuous, hence constant since it only takes integer values. And the homotopy H(x, t) == (1 - t)<I>(x) + t\Il(x) shows property (vi).
Next, the definition of deg(~, U, b) can be extended to a general ~ E

(A) Given <I> E C1(U,jRn) and b E jRn\<I>(8U), not necessarily a regular value,
Sard's theorem implies the existence of a sequence (bk ) converging to b,
where each bk is a regular value of <1>; one defines deg(<I>, U, b) by showing
that the limit below exists and does not depend on the choice of (bk):
deg (<I>, U, b) == lim deg (<I>, U, bk) .

(B) Given <I> E C(U,jRn) and b E jRn\<I>(au) , we consider a sequence (<I>k)
where <I>k E C1(U, jRn) is such that <I>k ~ <I> in C(U, jRn) and we define
deg(<I>, U, b) by showing that the limit below exists and does not depend
on the choice of (<I> k ) :
deg(<I>, U, b) == lim deg(<I>k' U, b) .

Here we mean C'<ciose but, in the general case to be considered, we should

Finally, it follows that the degree just defined satisfies properties (i)(vi). We should also mention that there is a degree theory in the infinitedimensional case, due to Leray and Schauder (see [50, 57]) which deals with
mappings <P E C(U, X), where U c X is a bounded open subset of a Banach space X and <P is a compact perturbation of the identity, that is, of
the form <p(u) == u - T(u) with T a compact mapping. The corresponding
Leray-Schauder degree also satisfies properties (i)-(vi).

2 The Abstract Result
In this section we state and prove Rabinowitz's saddle-point theorem.
Theorem 2.1. ([64]) Let X == V EB W be a Banach space, where dim V < 00,
and let .p E C 1 (X, JR.) be a functional satisfying the Palais-Smale condition
(P S). If D is a bounded neighborhood of 0 in V such that
a :== max c < inf ir: :== b
aD r

W r

(2.1)

,

then
c :== inf m~ rp(h( u))
hEr uED

is a critical value of .p with c 2 b. (Here r is the class of deformations of D in
X which fix aD pointwise, that is, T == {h E C(D,X) I h(u) == u, Vu E aD }.)
We first verify that h(D) n W -=I=- 0 for any hEr. In fact, if we let
P : X ----+ V denote the projection onto V along W, then Ph E C(D, V) and
Ph(u) == Pu == u =F 0 Vu E aD. Since we can identify V with JR.n, where
n == dim V, the degree deg(Ph, D, 0) is well defined and properties (i) and
(vi) of Section 1 imply that

Proof:

deg(Ph,D,O) == deg(Id,D,O) == 1.
Therefore, by property (ii) of that section, there exists Uo E D such that
Ph(uo) == 0, that is, h(uo) E W. This implies that
ma~ rp (h(u )) 2 b == inf rp ,
uED

W

hence c 2 b since hEr is arbitrary.
Now, assume by negation that c is not a critical value of ip, Then, by
the deformation theorem 3.2.2, there exist 0 < E <
(recall that a < b by
(2.1)) and rJ E C([O, 1] x X, X) such that

and (2.4) imply that

which contradicts the definition of c. Therefore, c is a critical value of~.

Remark 2.1. We should observe that Condition (2.1) is clearly satisfied when
~ is such that ~(v) ~ -00 as IIvll ~ 00, v E V, and ~(w) ~ +00 as
Ilwll ~ 00, w E W. This situation is typical in many applications.

3 Application to a Resonant Problem

existence of a solution for the following resonant problem

Therefore the nonlinearity f(x, s) == AkS + g(x, s) is such that !(:,8) ~ Ak as
lsi ~ 00, hence the terminology resonant problem. Clearly, some additional
condition is necessary for the solvability of (3.1) since, as we know, even in the
linear case g(x, s) == g(x) (say, a continuous function), one has the Fredholm
gvdx == 0 for all v in the Akalternative: (3.1) is solvable 'if and only if

where X o == Ni: and X+ (resp. X_) is the subspace where the operator

the respective orthogonal projections by Po, P+ and P_. Then, the following

Proof: (a) Let u == Pi.u E X_. Using (gl) together with the mean value

(b) Let u == Pou + Pi.u E X o EB X+. Now, using the fact that L is positive

(d) cp(u) ---+ +00 as lIull ---+ 00, u E X+.
Proof of Theorem 3.1 As mentioned earlier, we are going to use the saddlepoint theorem. Since we already know that cp E C 1(X,IR), we show now that
.p satisfies (P S).

Let (Un) be such that l<p( un) I :S C and <p' (un) ---+ O. Then, for all n

G(x, Pou) dx ,

where cp( un) is bounded together with the first two terms on the right-hand
side of the above expression (in view of (3.5)), it follows that the last term
is also bounded and, hence, because of (g:;), we can conclude that IIPoun11
is bounded. This, together with (3.5) shows that Ilun II is bounded. The
rest of the proof that <p satisfies (PS) is done as before, using the fact that
\7<p(u) == u - T(u) with T a compact operator.
Finally, Proposition 3.2 allows us to apply the saddle-point theorem with
V == X_, W == X o EB X+ to conclude the existence of a critical point of ip,
that is, a solution of (3.1).

then condition (gt) [resp. (g:;)] is satisfied.
Indeed, following [63], let v E N k and K > 0 be given and write v == pw

a == a(K) such that G(x, s) 2: K if lsi 2: a(K) and x E n. Then, since there

can choose p(K) sufficiently large so that 10p,K,wl 2: 101/2 for all p 2: p(K)

Critical Points under Constraints

1 Introduction. The Basic Minimization Principle

Revisited
In many variational problems one must find critical points of a given functional
cp E C 1 (X, IR) in the presence of constraints, that is, critical points of cp
restricted to a set M c X of constraints. Naturally, in order to be able
to talk about critical points of cplM, the set M must have a differentiable
structure. Typically, in the case of a finite number of constraints, M is of

the form M == {u E X I 'ljJj(u) == 0,
j == 1, ... ,k.

j == 1, ... ,k} where 'ljJj E C 1(X,IR),

Before considering critical points in general, let us review the situation of
minimum described in Section 2.1, where the set M of constraints does not
need to have a differentiable structure. Then, the same ideas of the basic
minimization principle, Theorem 2.1.3, can be used to prove the following:
Theorem 1.1. Let M be a weakly closed subset of a Hilbert space (or, more
generally, a reflexive Banach space) X. Suppose a functional <p : M ~ JR is

(i) weakly lower semicontinuous (w.l.s.c),
(ii) coercive, that is, cp(u) ----t +00 as Ilull----t 00, u E M.
Then cp is bounded from below and there exists Uo E M such that <p( uo)

inf M ip,
Proof: The proof is essentially the same as that of Theorem 2.1.3, where we
replaced B R by the bounded, weakly closed set M R == M n B R and recalled
that a bounded, weakly closed set is weakly compact. And, as before, in view

50

6 Critical Points under Constraints

of the coerciveness of cp, we pick p E M and R > 0 so that cp( u) ~ cp(p) for
"u"~R,UEM.

D

Remark 1.1. The special case M == X gives us Theorem 2.1.2. In this case,
as already observed in the remark following Theorem 2.1.2, any point Uo of
minimum of a C 1 functional cp : X ------t IR is a critical point of cp, that is,
ip' ( uo) == 0 E X*.

Remark 1.2. A typical example of a weakly closed set M c X is given by
M == {u E X I 1jJ(u) == c}, where 1jJ : X ------t IR is a weakly continuous
functional. More generally, if 1jJ : X ------t IR is a weakly l.s.c. functional, the
sets of the form 1jJc == {u E X I cp( u) S c}, c E IR, are weakly closed.

2 Natural Constraints
Now, we turn our attention to the problem of finding the critical points of
a functional .p E C 1(X, IR) over a set of constraints M c X which is a differentiable manifold. Besides the trivial case where M is an arbitrary closed
subspace of X, we will not consider a general submanifold M eX, but rather
those submanifolds of finite codimension. These correspond to situations in
which only a finite number of constraints are present. Let us recall some
definitions.
A subset M c X is a Cm-submanifold of codimension k (m, k ~ 1 integers)
if, for each Uo E M, there exists an open neighborhood U of Uo and a function
1jJ E Cm(U, IRk) such that
(i) 1jJ' (u) is surjective for every u E U,
(ii) M n U == {u E U I 1jJ (u) == O}.
In this case the tangent space to M at the point Uo E M, denoted by TuoM,
is defined as the space of all tangent vectors I' (0) to M at Uo, where I :
(-E, E) ------t M is an arbitrary C 1 curve in M passing through Uo, that is,
1(0) == Uo, and such that I'(t) i- 0 Vt E (-E, E).
Finally, given a functional cp E C 1(X ,IR), we say a point Uo E M is a
critical point of cplM if

d

dt cp( I( t)) It=o == 0
for every C 1 curve I : (-E, E) ------t M passing through Uo.

(2.1)

2 Natural Constraints

51

The following result, which is well known in finite dimension (and whose
proof we omit in infinite dimension, cf. Theorem 3.1.31 in [15]), shows that a
critical point of a constrained functional is a critical point of a related unconstrained functional. (This is the so-called method of Lagrange multipliers.)
Theorem 2.1. Let .p E C 1 (X, IR) and suppose M C X is a C'<submomijold
of codimension k, say M == {u E U I 1/Jj (u) == 0, j == 1, ... ,k} where 1/Jj E
C 1 (U, JR), j == 1,... ,k, U c X is an open set and 1/J~ (u ), . . . ,1/J~ (u ) are
linearly independent for each u E U.

Then, if u E M is a critical point of

r,pIM, there exists :\ == (AI, ... ,Ak) E IRk such that
k

r,p' (u) == :\ . 1/J' (u) ==

L Aj1/Jj (u) .

(2.2)

j=1

(The Aj 's are called Lagrange multipliers.)

Next, given a submanifold M C X as above, if Uo E M is a critical point
of an unconstrained functional r,p E C 1 (X, IR), then Uo is also a critical point
of r,pIM since (2.1) is easily verified in this case (r,p'(uo) == 0 E X* implies, in
particular, that r,p' (uo).r' (0) == 0 for all tangent vectors r' (0) to M at uo). The
converse statement is not true in general. However, if a given critical point
E M of r,pIM is also a critical point of the unconstrained functional r,p, we say
that the submanifold M is a natural constraint for the critical point E M
(in view of (2.2), this is the case if and only if all the Lagrange multipliers
Aj == Aj (u) are equal to zero). We say that M is a natural constraint for .p if
M is a natural constraint for each critical point u of ep 1M, that is,

u

u

K(epIM) == K(ep) n M

(2.3)

(cf. [45]), where we are denoting by K(0) the set of critical points of 0.
A particularly important situation occurs when a given critical point Uo of
.p E C 1 (X, IR) is not a global minimum, say, a saddle-point), but it is possible
to find a submanifold M c X which is a natural constraint for .p and is such
that Uo E M is a global minimum for eplM (cf. the definition of natural
constraint in [15], Section 3.3B, where in addition M is required to contain all
critical points of ip, that is, K(r,pIM) == K(r,p)). We shall see some applications
in the next section.

This means that any neighborhood of UQ contains points u, v with <.p( u) < <.p( UQ) <
<.p( v).

3 Applications
Application A. We consider the question of existence of T-periodic solutions
for the classic Hamiltonian system

X + \7xV(t,x) == 0
{ x(O) == x(T) , ±(O) == ±(T) ,

(3.1)

where x(t) E lR n and V(t, x) satisfies

V : lR x lR n ----+ lR is continuous, V(·, x) is T-periodic and V(t,·) is differentiable with \7xV(t,x) continuous for any t E lR, x E lR n .
(VI)
Let X denote the following Sobolev space of T-periodic functions, X ==
H} == {x : lR ---+ lR n I x is abs. continuous, T-periodic and JoT 1±1 2dt < 00 },
endowed with its natural inner product

where . and I . I denote the Euclidean scalar product and norm in lRn .
Lemma 3.1. If (VI) holds, then the functional
sp (x) ==

is well defined and of class CIon X, with

[X . Z - V x V (t , X) . Z] dt

'<:/x,ZEX.

(3.3)

Moreover, the critical points of .p are the classical C 2 solutions of (3.1).
Proof: Since V is continuous on lR x lR n by (VI) and any function x E X is
absolutely continuous with JOT 1±1 2dt < 00, it is clear that the functional .p is
well defined on X. Also, the fact that .p E C 1(X,lR) with the derivative given
by (3.3) can be easily verified, so that we leave these as an exercise for the
reader (cf. Exercise 2).
Finally, the proof that the critical points of ~ are the classic C 2 solutions
of (3.1) is also standard. Indeed, if x E X is a critical point of ~, then

3 Applications

53

which implies that x E X is a weak solution of (3.1). Since x E X is continuous
and, by (VI), \7x V is also continuous, it follows that x == v in the weak sense,
where v(t) == \7xV(t,x(t)) is also a continuous function. Therefore, the weak
solutions x(t) are classical C 2 solutions (cf. [70]).
D

Remark 3.1. It should be noted that, in this case, one also has the gradient
of .p, \7cp : X -----* X, of the form \7cp(x) == x - K(x) with K : X -----* X a
compact operator. In fact, since K(x) is defined by
(K(x),z) =

I

T

[x + 'Vx V (t , x )] oz dt

\:jx,zEX,

the compactness of K in this case is an immediate consequence of the compact
embedding X C 0[0, T] (see Exercise 3).

Lemma 3.2. (cf. [76j) Assume the conditions (VI) and (V2 ) , where

\7xV(-t, -x) == -\7xV(t,x) Vt,x

(i. e., \7x V is an odd function of t, x). Then, the closed subspace of the odd
functions in X,

M == {x E X I x(-t) == -x(t) Vt}
is a natural constraint for ip,
Proof:

Let Xo E M be a critical point of cplM, that is,

\:jz EM.

Since we can decompose X == M EB M 1.., where M 1.. is the subspace of the
even functions in X, in order to show that Xo E M is a critical point of ip, it
suffices to verify that

But this is true since (V2 ) and the fact that Xo is an odd function imply that
the above integrand is an odd (T-periodic) function.
D

Lemma 3.3. (Wirtinger Inequality) If x E X and JOT x dt == 0, then

54

Proof: It is a consequence of the Parseval identity applied to the functions
x and ±, by noticing that the constant term in the Fourier expansion of the
function x E X is zero, since x has zero-mean value.

Remark 3.2. Note that Wirtinger inequality is the analogue in the periodic
situation of the Poincare inequality.
Theorem 3.4. ([76j)Assume conditions (VI) - (V3 ) , where

Then, Problem (3.1) has a classical, odd solution, which minimizes the functional cp over M == {x E X I x is odd}. If, in addition, V satisfies

then (3.1) has a unique (classical, odd) solution.
Proof: Since M is a natural constraint by Lemma 3.2, it suffices to find a
critical point of .p1M.
If x E M, we have JOT xdt == 0, so that Wirtinger's inequality (Lemma 3.3)
implies the following lower estimate for ep, where (1 - ~~:) > 0:

Therefore, ep is coercive on M. Since ep is weakly l.s.c. (being the sum of a
continuous convex functional and a weakly continuous functional), Theorem
1.1 implies the existence of Xo E M such that cp(xo) == inf M ip,
Clearly Xo E M is a critical point of cplM, hence a critical point of cp (since
M is a natural constraint) and a classical solution of (3.1) by Lemma 3.1.

It is clear that (3.4) has the trivial solution u(x) == O. Here, using the

Such a solution, which is of a saddle-point type for the above functional, can
be found by other methods, e.g., Amann's reduction method [4] or, since F is
convex, by the duality method of Clarke and Ekeland [26] (we will treat this
latter method in the next chapter).

<p'(u)·h= k[\lu.\lh-f(U)h] dx=O VhEX,
so that, by choosing h == 1 E X, we get In j(u)dx == 0, i.e., u E M, and thus
u is a critical point of cpIM. Conversely, if u E M is critical point of cpIM,
then by Theorem 2.1, there exists A E IR such that

Remark 3.3. The previous lemma not only shows that M is a natural constraint for cp but, in fact, shows that M contains all critical points of cp (i.e.,
M is a natural constraint according to [15, Section 6.3BJ.

Proof:

(i) The convexity of F implies the inequality
F(s) - F(8) 2: f(8)(s - 8) VS,8 E JR.

Letting s == v(x), 8 == v(x) + c and integrating over 0 gives

kF(v) dX-kF(v+c) dX'2k f(v+c)(-c) dx=O,
since v + c EM.

(ii) Define the function 9 : X o x JR ~ JR by the formula
g(v, c) =

k

f(v + c) dx .

(In other words, g(v, c) == 7jJ(v + c) in the notation of Lemma 3.5 (i) and
g(v, c) == 0 if and only if v+c EM.) Then, for each v E X o fixed, the function
9 ( v, .) is strictly increasing since f is also. In fact, since a < f' (s) < b for all
s E JR (and some 0 < a < b), it is not hard to see that, for each v E X o, there
exists a unique c == c(v) E JR such that v + c EM.
Now, assume by contradiction that there exists a sequence V n + Cn E M
with Ilvn + Cn II ~ 00 and Ilvn II bounded. Then, we may assume that there
exists v E X o such that V n ~ v weakly in X, V n ~ v strongly in £1(0) and
ICnl ~ 00, say c., ~ 00. By picking a > c(v) and an integer no such that
g(v, cn) 2: g(v, a) for all n 2: no, we obtain

Theorem 3.7. Under Condition (3.5), Problem (3.4) possesses a nontrivial
weak solution Uo E HI (0) minimizing the functional <.p over the manifold

M == {u E H 1(0) I In f(u)dx == 0 }.

Proof: We can use Theorem 1.1 by noticing that M is weakly closed since
the functional 7jJ : H 1(0) ~ JR, 7jJ(u) ==
f(u)dx, is weakly continuous.
Also, the functional

is weakly l.s.c., since it is the sum of a continuous, convex functional and
a weakly continuous functional (Recall Examples Band C in Section 2.1).
Therefore, it remains to prove that cp is coercive on M.

l\7vl 2 dx ---+ 00. But, then, (3.10) shows that 4?( v+ e) ---+ 00, so that 4? is
coercive on M.
In view of Theorem 1.1 there exists Uo E M such that 4?(uo) == inf M 4? In
order to show that Uo =1= 0, it suffices to find u E M such that 4?(u) < 0 == 4?(0).

This situation is the J-dirnensional analogue (which we chose for simplicity)
of the problem of finding conformally equivalent Riemannian structures on

the periodic function k(t) for problem (3.12) to have a solution.
In what follows, we denote by X the Sobolev space X == ui; == {u : 1R -----+

which implies that u E X is a weak solution, hence a classical solution of the
problem -it + h == Alke u + A2' u(O) == u(21r), u(O) == u(21r). By integrating
this last equation over [0,21r] and using (3.13) together with the fact that

Jo ke" dt == 0 (as u EM), we obtain A2 == O. It necessarily follows that
Al i= 0 since, otherwise, u would be a solution of (3.14), that is, of the form

27r
u == Uo + C, but, on the other hand, the fact that Jo ke" dt == 0 (as U E M)
contradicts (3.16). We have shown that a critical point u E M of <pIM is a
solution of the problem

-u + h == Alkeu , u(O) == u(21r) , u(O) == u(21r) ,

Theorem 3.9. Suppose that (3.13) holds true and k(t) i- 0. Then, Problem

Proof: (i) If U is a solution of problem (3.12), then by integrating the cor27r
responding equation over [0,27r], we obtain Jo ke" dt == 0, so that k(t) must

(ii) Conversely, suppose that (3.16) is satisfied. Then, in view of Lemma 3.8,
in order to show that Problem (3.12) has a solution, it suffices to find a critical

since M c X o == {u E X I Jo u dt == O} and the Wirtinger inequality holds

A Duality Principle

1 Convex Functions. The Legendre-Fenchel Transform
A function F : IRn ------+ IR is said to be convex if, for any u, v E IRn and

A E [0,1], one has
F((l - A)U + AV) ~ (1 - A)F(u) + AF(v) .
The function F is called strictly convex if one has strict inequality when U i- v
and A i- 0,1. It is easy to verify that if F E 0 1(JR.n, JR.), then F is convex if
and only if the gradient of F, \7 F : JR.n ------+ JR.n, is a monotone mapping, that
is,

(\7F(u) - \7F(v),u - v) ~

° Vu,v IRn ,
E

where we are denoting by (.,.) the usual inner product in JR.n. Moreover,
F E 0 1(JR.n, JR.) is strictly convex if and only if \7F is strictly monotone (i.e.,
the above inequality is strict whenever u -# v).
Proposition 1.1. Let F E 0 1(JR.n, JR.) be convex and such that \7 F : JR.n ------+
JR.n is 1 - 1 and onto. Then, for each v E JR.n, the function u f---+ (v, u) - F( u)
is bounded from above and the formula

G(v) == sup[(u, v) - F(u)]
u

(1.1)

defines a function G : JR.n ------+ JR. such that G E 0 1(JR.n, JR.) and \7G == (\7 F)-I.

Remark 1.1. G :== F* is called the Legendre-Fenchel transform of F. The
assumptions in the above Proposition 1.1 are satisfied when, for example,
F E 01(JR.n,JR.) is strictly convex and F(u)/Iul -+ 00 as lui -+ 00. Indeed,
since F is strictly convex, \7F is clearly 1 - 1. On the other hand, for each

64

7 A Duality Principle

fixed v E JRn, the function u r--+ F (u)- (v, u) is coercive in view of the coercivity
of F(u)/Iul. Therefore, the function u r--+ F(u) - (v, u) is bounded from below
and there exists u E JRn such that F(u) - (v,u) == infu[F(u) - (v,u)]. Since
F E C 1 (JRn, JR), we necessarily have \7F(u) -v == 0, that is, \7F(u) == v.
Thus, \7F is also onto JRn.

Proof of Proposition 1.1: First, since F is of class C 1 and convex, we observe
that

F(w) 2:: F(u) + (\7F(u),w - u)

(1.2)

for any u, w E JRn. Indeed, the convexity of F implies that

~[F(u

+ ,x(w - u)) - F(u)] ~ F(w) - F(u)

°

for ,X E [0,1]' so that, passing to the limit as ,X ---+ yields (1.2).
Now, if for any given v E JRn we define u :== (\7F)-1(V) and use (1.2), we
obtain
(v, w) - F(w) ~ (v, u) - F(u) Vw E JRn.
Therefore, the function w r--+ (v, w) - F( w) is bounded from above and its
supremum is attained when w == u == (\7F) -1 ( v), that is,
G(v) == sup[(v,w) - F(w)] = (v, (~F)-l(v)) - F((~F)-l(V)) .

(1.3)

w

In particular, one obtains the so-called Fenchel inequality,

(v, w) ~ F(w) + G(v) Vv, w E IRn.

(1.4)

In order to show that G E C 1 (IRn , IR) with ~ G == (\7F) -1, we fix Vo E IRn and
write Uo == (\7F)-l(VO), Uh == (\7F)-1(vO + h) to obtain, from (1.3),

Hence

(1.5)
in view of (1.2). On the other hand, using (1.4) with v == Vo + h, w == Uo gives

G(vo + h) - G(vo) 2:: (vo + h,uo) - F(uo) - G(vo) ,
hence

which implies G(va + h) - G(va) - (h, ua) == o(h) as Ihl ~ 0, since Uh - Ua ==
(\7F)-l(va + h) - (\7F)-l(va) and (\7F)-l : JRn ------t JRn is continuous by
the theorem on domain invariance (cf. [15, Theorem 5.4.11]. We have shown
that there exists \7G(va) and that \7G(va) == Ua == (\7F) -1 ( va). Moreover,
\7G == (\7F) -1 is continuous, hence G E 0 1 (JRn , JR).

3 A Dual Variational Formulation
In this section we introduce a variational formulation which is dual to that
considered in the previous section, and which constitutes a variant of the
duality principle due to Clarke and Ekeland for Hamiltonian systems (cf. [26]).
Our presentation will follow the work [17] of Brezis (see also [30]).
As before, L : D(L) c X ~ X is a selfadjoint operator on the Hilbert
space X == L 2([2;IRn), [2 c IR N a bounded domain, and F : ~n ~ ~ is a
function of class C 1 . In addition, we now assume that
The range R( L ) of L is closed;
F is convex with \l F : IRn ~ IR 1 - 1 and onto (for example, F strictly

convex and such that F(u)/Iul ---+ 00 as lui ---+ 00, cf. Remark 1.1).

(F1 )

In this case, since L is selfadjoint, assumption (L 1 ) implies that we can
decompose the space X as

X == N(L) EB R(L) ,
where N(L) is the null space of L, R(L) is the range of L, and the restriction
LIR(L) : D(L) n R(L) ~ R(L) has a bounded inverse K == L -1 : R(L) ~
R(L). Moreover, in view of Proposition 1.1, assumption (F1 ) implies that the

68

7 A Duality Principle

Legendre-Fenchel transform of F, G == F* : IRn -----+ IR, is well defined and
\lG == (\IF)-I.
Now, by making the change of variable v == \IF(u) in (P), that is, u ==
\l G(v), we obtain the equivalent problem

L(\lG(v)) + v == 0,

v E R(L),

or, by applying K == L -1,

Kv + \lG(v) E N(L) ,

v E R(L).

(P*)

The above problem (P*) is dual to problem (P) and, similarly to problem
(P), it has a variational formulation:
Find the critical points of the functional 'ljJ == ip" given by

'IjJ(v) = ~(Kv, v)x + ( G(v) dx , v E R(L)

in

2

(¢*)

(which we call the dual action of Clarke-Ekeland). In fact, in order to show
that 'ljJ is well defined, we will use the following proposition, where F : IR n -----+
IR is assumed to satisfy a stronger condition than (F1 ) .
Proposition 3.1. Assume conditions (L 1 ) and (F2 ) , where

FECI (IR n , IR) is strictly convex and there exist constants 0 < a :::; (3,
fJ E IR, such that
0: lul

Then, the functional 'ljJ : R( L) -----+ IR given by (¢*) is well defined and of class
C 1 with
'ljJ'(v) . k == (Kv + \lG(v), k)x \Iv, k E R(L).
In particular, v E R( L) is a solution of (P*) if and only if v is a critical point
of'ljJ·
Proof: In view of (F2 ) and Remark 1.2, the dual action of Clarke-Ekeland,
G == F*, is well defined and satisfies

(3.1)
In particular, the second inequality above shows that the dual action 'ljJ given
by formula (¢*) is well defined. Also, we have that G E C 1 (IRn , IR) and G is

3 A Dual Variational Formulation

69

strictly convex (i.e., V'G is strictly monotone), since FECI (lR n , lR) is strictly
convex, and V'G == (V'F)-l. Therefore, since G satisfies (3.1), we obtain from
Remark 1.1 that G* is well defined. Moreover, given u E lR n , we have

G*(u) == sup[(u, z) - G(z)] == (u, (V'G)-l(u)) - G((V'G)-l(u)) ,
z

or
G* (u) == (u,v) - G (v) ,

(3.2)

where v == (V'G)-l(u), i.e., u == V'G(v) == (V'F)-l(v). Comparing (3.2) with

(1.3) we conclude that G*(u) == F(u). Hence, using the first inequality in (F2 )
with u == V'G (v), it follows that

a 1~12 _ 8 ~ F(u) = G*(u) = (u, v) ~ G(v) ,
so that (since G( v) ~ -6 from (3.1))

which shows that IV'G(v)1 has linear growth in Ivl:
IV'G(v)1 ~ clvl + d .

(3.3)

Finally, in view of (3.3), it is easy to check that the dual action 1jJ given in
(¢*) is of class CIon the closed subspace R(L) C X == L 2(0; JRn) and

'Ij;'(v) . k =

.L

[(Kv, k) + (\7G(v), k)] dx

==(Kv+V'G(v),k)x

Vv,kER(L).

In particular, v E R(L) is such that 1jJ' (v) == 0 E R(L ) * if and only if K v +
V'G( v) E R(L)1- == N(L), that is, if and only if v is a solution of (P*).

Remark 3.1. Note that, for v E R(L), the gradient V'1jJ(v) is given by
V'1jJ(v) == Kv + QV'G(v), where Q : X ---+ R(L) is the orthogonal projection of X onto R(L).
Remark 3.2. As we have seen above, if we assume (L 1 ) and (F2 ) , then problem (P), whose variational formulation (cf. Proposition 2.1) is given by

V'P(u) == 0,

u E D(L),

(VF)

70

7 A Duality Principle

is equivalent to the dual problem (P*), whose variational formulation (cf.
Proposition 3.1) is given by

V''ljJ(v) == 0,

(VF*)

v E R(L)

(where we recall that the dual action 'ljJ == ip" is defined in (¢*)). More
precisely, we have seen that if u E D(L) is a critical point of rp (i.e., u E D(L)
is a solution of (P)), then v == - Lu E R( L) is a critical point of 'ljJ (i.e.,
v E R( L) is a solution of (P*)). And, conversely, if v E R( L) is a critical
point of 'ljJ, then u == V'G(v) E D(L) is a critical point of rp (indeed, from
Kv + V'G(v) == w E N(L) we obtain L(Kv + V'G(v)) == 0, that is, v + Lu == 0
with u == V'G(v) == (V'F)-1 (v)).
We point out that working with the dual action 'ljJ instead of rp can be useful in situations in which the functional .p is indefinite (because the quadratic
term ~(Lu, u)x neither dominates nor is dominated by the term
F(u)dx),
whereas 'ljJ becomes a coercive functional (because the term
G( v )dx dominates the quadratic term ~ (K v, v) x ). We shall see examples of such situations
in the following section.

In this section we first present a result due to Coron [28] on the existence of
a nontrivial solution for the problem

Lu + V'F (u) == 0,

u E D (L) eX,

(P)

where, as before, X == L 2(0; }Rn) and L : D(L) c X ~ X is a selfadjoint
operator. Now, we assume that the essential spectrum of L is empty, that
is, a(L) == {Aj I j E Z (or N)}, where each Aj is an isolated eigenvalue of
finite multiplicity, and that FECI (}Rn , }R) is strictly convex and satisfies
F(O) == V'F(O) == o. Clearly, in this case u == 0 is a solution of (P) and, in
fact, is the unique solution if L is a monotone operator. Therefore, we will
assume that a(L) n (-00,0) i= 0 and denote the first negative eigenvalue of L
by A-I.
Theorem 4.1. ([28}) In addition to the above conditions, if F and L satisfy

then problem (P) has a nontrivial solution.
Here we will present a proof that uses the dual action 'ljJ of Clarke and
Ekeland and which shows that one such nontrivial solution can be found by
minimization of'ljJ over R(L), cf. [30].
Lemma 4.2. If L : D(L) C X ~ X is a selfadjoint operator on X ==
L 2 (0; IRn) having an empty essential spectrum and F E C 1 (IRn, IR) is a strictly
convex function satisfying (F3 ) , then the dual action 'ljJ : R(L) ~ IR is coercive.

Proof: In view of the assumption on L, the range R(L) is closed and the
restriction LID(L)nR(L) ~ R(L) possesses a compact inverse K: R(L) ~
R(L). Moreover, through an eigenfunction expansion argument, K satisfies
the estimate from below

(Kv, v)x ::0: A-I Ilvll~ \:Iv E R(L).

is well defined and of class C 1 . Now, from (4.1) and (3.1) (recalled above),
we obtain

7jJ(v) ::0:

Therefore, since 0 < {3 < - A-1' the dual action 'ljJ is coercive.

Lemma 4.3. Assume that the selfadjoint operator L is as in the previous
lemma and satisfies the condition (L 2 ) . In addition, assume that F E

(F4 ) are satisfied.1 Then, there exists p > 0 such that

that F( u) 2: A* lul 2 /2 for lui::; E. On the other hand, there exists p' > 0 such
that I\7G(v) I ::; E for Ivl ::; p'. Therefore, since G(v) == (u, v) - F( u) with

of the assumption (L 2 ) and the fact that N(L - A-I) is finite dimensional.D

Proof of Theorem 4.1: In view of Proposition 3.1 and Remark 3.2, it suffices
to find a critical point Va =I- 0 of the dual action ?jJ E C I (R(L), IR). Since?jJ is
coercive by Lemma 4.2 and weakly l.s.c. (cf. Examples A and C in Chapter
2), it follows that ?jJ (vo) == inf R( L) ?jJ for some Va E R( L ). Therefore, Va is a
critical point of ?jJ and, since ?jJ(va) < 0 by Lemma 4.3, we have that Va =I- O.
D
Next, we apply Theorem 4.1 to the problem of existence of aT-periodic
solution for the classical second-order Hamiltonian system

x + \7V (x) == 0 ,

(HS)

where x(t) E IRn and V E C I (IRn, IR) is a strictly convex function satisfying

(Compare with Theorem 6.3.4.) In this case one can show that, in fact, the

Theorem 4.4. {[26}} Under the above conditions, the (H S) has a periodic
solution with minimal period T, for each T > o.

Proof:

Let X == L 2 (0, T; ]Rn) and L : D(L) c X ---+ X be defined by

Lx==x VXED(L) ,
D(L) == {x E X I x, x abs. continuous, x(O) == x(T), x(O) == x(T) and x EX}.

Then L is selfadjoint, a(L) == {- ";1 I j == 0,1,2, ... } and each A_j ==
-41f 2 j2 /T 2 is an eigenvalue of L having finite multiplicity. The eigenfunc-

tions corresponding to A_j are given by

where 0 =I- e E ]Rn, so that condition (L 2 ) is satisfied. Also, assumption (VI)
implies (F3 ) and (F4 ) . Therefore, in view of Theorem 4.1, the Hamiltonian
system (H S) possesses a nontrivial T-periodic solution Xo such that Vo ==
- Lxi, =I- 0 minimizes the dual action 1/; over R( L).
It remains to show that Vo has minimal period T. Assume, by negation,
that Vo has period !i;, where m 2: 2. If we define vo(t) == vo(t/m), we readily
obtain that Vo E R(L) (i.e., JoT vodt == 0) and

1/;(vo) == ~2 (K vo,vo)x +

so that 1/; (vo) < 'l/J (vo), since m 2:: 2 and K is negative definite on R( L ). This
contradicts the fact that Vo minimizes ib. Therefore, Vo indeed has minimal
period T.

Critical Points under Symmetries

1 Introduction
As we have mentioned briefly in Section 4.1, the central idea behind the the
so-called Lusternik-Schnirelman theory is to obtain critical values of a given
functional c.p E C 1 (X, lR) as minimax (or maximin) values of c.p over suitable
classes A k of subsets of X,
Ck ==

inf sup c.p(x) ,

AEAkxEA

k == 1,2, ... ,

where, originally, the classes A k were based on the topological notion of category of Lusternik-Schnirelman.
When the problem presents symmetries, that is, when there exists some
group G acting in a continuous manner on the space X and the functional
.p is invariant under that action, then it usually happens that cp possesses
many critical points. The typical example of such a multiplicity situation is
a classical theorem of Lusternik, which guarantees the existence of at least
(n + 1) distinct pairs of critical points for any functional .p E C 1 (sn , lR) that is
even ([53]). Moreover, when in presence of symmetries, it is possible to choose
the classes A k by using topological notions which are more manageable than
the category.
In this section we will be considering this question of multiplicity versus
symmetry. Our presentation will follow the work [55] of Mawhin-Willem, and
we will start by introducing the notion of a G-index theory. The most wellknown examples of such theories refer to the cases where G == Z2 or G == s',
In the first case, we have the notion of genus due to Krasnoselskii [47] (also see
Coffman [27]). In the second case, we have the cohomological index of FadellRabinowitz [41] (see also Fadell-Husseini-Rabinowitz [42]) and the geometric
index of Benci [10].

76

8 Critical Points under Symmetries

2 The Lusternik-Schnirelman Theory
Let X be a Banach space and let G be a compact topological group. Assume
that {T(g) I 9 E G} is an isometric representation of G on X, that is, for each
9 E G, T(g) : X ----+ X is an isometry and the following properties hold:

(i) T(gl + g2) == T(gl) 0 T(g2) \;/gl, g2 E G ,
(ii) T(O) == 1 (the identity on X) ,
(iii) (g,u) r--+ T(g)u is continuous.
The orbit of an element u E X is the set O(u) == {T(g)u I 9 E G}, and a
subset A c X is said to be invariant if T(g)A == A for all 9 E G, that is, if
A is a union of orbits. On the other hand, a functional <p : X ----+ JR is called
invariant if .p is constant on each orbit of X, that is, .p 0 T(g) == .p for all
9 E G. And, given invariant subsets AI, A 2, a mapping R : Al ----+ A 2 is said
to be equivariant if R 0 T(g) == T(g) 0 R for all 9 E G (i.e., R maps the orbit
of u pointwise onto the orbit of R(u)).
Let us denote by A the class of all closed and invariant subsets of X,
A == {A c X IA is closed and T(g)A == A \;/g E G }.

Definition. A G-index on X (w.r.t. A) is a mapping ind : A ----+ N U {oo}
satisfying the following properties (for any A, N, AI, A 2 E A):
(a) ind (A) == 0 if and only if A == 0;
(b) If R : Al ----+ A 2 is continuous and equivariant, then ind (AI) ::; ind (A 2);
(c) ind (AI U A 2) ::; ind (AI) + ind (A 2);
(d) If A E A is compact, then there exists a neighborhood N of A such that
N E A and ind (N) == ind (A).

Proposition 2.1. Let X be a Banach space, G == Z2 == {O,l}, and define
T(O) == 1, T(l) == -1 (where 1 : X ----+ X is the identity map on X). Given
any closed, symmetric (w.r.t. the origin) subset A E A, define ,(A) == kEN if
k is the smallest integer such that there exists some odd, continuous mapping
1> : A ----+ JRk\ {O}. Also define ,(A) == 00 if no such mapping exists, and set
,(0) == o. Then, the mappinq v : A ----+ Nu {oo} is a Z2-index on X.
Remark. This Z2-index is called the genus and it was originally introduced
by Krasnoselskii [47]. The definition given above is due to Coffman [27] (and
it is equivalent to the original definition of Krasnoselskii).
Proof of Proposition 2.1: First, observe that A c X is Z2-invariant if and
only if u E A implies -u E A, that is, A is symmetric w.r.t. the origin in X.

2 The Lusternik-Schnirelman Theory

77

Thus A == {A c X I A is closed and - A == A }. On the other hand, given
invariant subsets AI, A2 , a mapping R : Al --+ A2 is equivariant if and only
if R is continuous and odd. Let us check properties (a) - (d) in the definition
of a G-index.

(a) This property is immediate from the definition of ,.

(b) Since there is nothing to prove if ,(A2 ) == 00, let us assume that ,(A2 ) ==
k < 00, so that there exists a continuous, odd mapping <P : A 2 --+ }Rk\ {O}.
Then, since the mapping <P 0 R : Al --+ }Rk\ {O} is also continuous and odd,
it follows from the definition that ,(AI) :s; k.
(c) Again, there is nothing to prove if ,(AI) == (X) or ,(A2 ) == 00. Therefore,
we assume that ,(AI) == k l < (X) and ,(A2 ) == k 2 < 00, so that there exist
continuous, odd mappings <Pj : A j --+ }Rkj\{O}, j == 1,2. Let Wj : X --+ }Rk j
be the continuous, odd extension of <P j, obtained by taking the odd part

Wj == ~ [<I> j ( u) - <I> j ( -u)] of some extension <I> j of <P j (guaranteed by Tietze
extension theorem). Then, the mapping W : X --+ }Rk 1+k 2 defined by

is such that w(A I U A2 ) C }Rk1 +k2 \ {O} because Wj (A j ) C }Rk j \ {O}. It follows
that the restriction (of W to A I U A 2 )

is a continuous, odd mapping and, hence, {(AI U A 2 ) :s; k l + k 2 .
(d) As before, it suffices to consider the case ,(A) == k < (X) so that there
exists an odd mapping <P E C(A, JRk\{O}). Let W E C(X, JRk) be an odd
extension of <P, obtained as in (c). Since 0 ~ w(A) == <I>(A) and A is compact by assumption, there exists c5 > 0 such that 0 ~ w(A b ) , where A b :==
{u E X I dist (u, A) :s; c5}. Then, the set N == A b is a closed neighborhood of
A, which is clearly invariant, and ,(N) :s; k by construction. On the other
hand, property (b) implies that k == ,(A) :s; ,(N) since the inclusion A C N

is obviously continuous and odd. Thus, ,(N) == ,(A) == k.

D

Our next proposition provides several examples of the genus of subsets
of X.

Proposition 2.2. (i) If 0

c X is closed and 0 n (-0) == 0, then

,(0 U (-0)) == 1;
(ii) If A E A and there exists an odd homeomorphism h : A --+ Sk-I,
then ,(A) == k (in particular, ,(Sk-I) == k),.

78

8 Critical Points under Symmetries

(iii) If A E A is such that 0 ~ A and ,(A) 2:: 2, then A has infinitely many
points.
Proof: (i) Simply take <I> : C U (-C) - - t JR\{O} defined by <I>(u) == 1 if
u E C, <I>(u) == -1 if u E -C.
(ii) Since h : A - - t Sk-1 is continuous and odd, we have that ,(A) ~ k.
On the other hand, if ,(A) == j < k, then there exists an odd mapping
<I> E C(A,JRj\{O}), hence an odd mapping W:== <I> 0 h- 1 E C(Sk-1,JRj\{0}).
Since j < k, the mapping W (considered as a mapping taking values into JRk) is
clearly homotopic to a constant mapping Wo == uo, where 0 =F Uo E JRk\JRj, say
IUo I > 1. 1 It follows from properties (v), (ii) in Section 5.1 that, necessarily
we have the degree deg(W,Bk,O) == 0, where Bi. is the unit ball in JRk. But
this contradicts the Borsuk theorem (cf. [57]): "If 0 c JRk is a bounded, open
and symmetric set with 0 E 0 and if W E C(80, JRk\ {O}) is an odd mapping,
then deg(W, 0, 0) is an odd integer."
(iii) It suffices to observe that if A E A is a set with a finite number of points
and 0 ~ A, then we can write A as a union A == C u (-C) with C n (-C) == 0,
so that ,(A) == 1 in view of (i).

Remark 2.1. An example of an index theory in the case G == Sl will be
presented in Chapter 9.

3 The Basic Abstract Multiplicity Result
In this section we will state and prove the basic multiplicity result in the
Lustcrnik-Schnirelrnan theory in the presence of symmetries. For that, we
will need a deformation theorem which preserves the symmetries, that is, a
deformation TJ E C([0, 1] x X, X) as in Chapter 3 satisfying the additional
condition that TJ(t,') : X - - t X is equivariant for each t E [0,1]. On the other
hand, the existence theorem of an equivariant deformation will be based on
the notion of an equivariant pseudo-gradient for an invariant functional <p E
C 1 (X, JR), whose existence will be established after two preliminary lemmas
(cf. [55]).
Lemma 3.1. Let CP E 0 1 (X, JR) be an invariant functional.

Proof: Since each T(g) : X ----+ X is a surjective isometry (i.e., a unitary
mapping) with inverse T( -g), (ii) follows readily from (i). So, it suffices to
check (i). Indeed, the invariance of <p and the definition of <p' (v) . k imply

Lemma 3.2. Let w : Y ----+ X be a locally Lipschitzian mapping, where X

We leave it as an exercise for the reader (or see [55]).

Proposition 3.3. An invariant functional .p E C 1 (X, lR) possesses an equivariant pseudo-gradient, that is, a locally Lipschitzian mapping v : Y ----+ X,
where Y == {u E X 1 <p'(U) i= O}, satisfying:

(i) II v (u ) II < 211 <p' (u) II;
(ii) cp' (u) . v (u) ~ II ip' ( u ) 11 2 ;
(iii) v is equivariant.

Proof: We show the existence of an equivariant pseudo-gradient (for rp) starting from a corresponding pseudo-gradient w, whose existence shall be assumed
without a proof, as in Section 3.1. Indeed, define

v(u) =

fc

T( -g)w(T(g)u) dg, u E Y ,2

where dg is the Haar measure on G, normalized so that f G dg == 1 (see [48]).
We have:

Itv(u)tl <

fc

Itw(T(g)u)lt dg:S:

fc

2tlrp'(T(g)u)tt dg = 2tlrp'(u)tl ,

== Z2 with T(O) == I, T(l) == -I, we observe that v(u) is simply the
odd part of w(u), i.e., v(u) == ~ [w(u) - w(-u)].

Ilrp'(T(g)u)11 dg = Ilrp'(u)11 ,

where we used Lemma 3.1 (i) and (ii), respectively, in the second and last
equality. This proves item (ii).
The proof that v(u) is an equivariant pseudo-gradient follows from

v(T(g)u)) =

T(g)T(-g-g)w(T(g+g)u) dg=T(g)v(u) ,

where we used the translation invariance of the Haar measure in the last
equality above.
Finally, we show that v is locally Lipschitzian. For fixed U E Y, let A ==

{T(g)u I 9 E G} be the orbit of u and 8 >

Lipschitzian on A 8 , with (say) constant l. Then, for arbitrary Ul, U2 E A 8 (u),
we have

Theorem 3.4. (Theorem of the Equivariant Deformation) Let .p E 0 1 (X, lR)
be an invariant functional satisfying the Palais-Smale condition (PS). Ij U is
an invariant open neighborhood of K c ' c E lR, then, for all E sufficiently small,
there exists T/ E 0([0,1] x X, X) such that (for any u E X and t E [0,1]):

(i) T/(O,u)==u,
(ii) T/(t, u) == u if u ~ rp-1[C - 2E, C + 2E] ,
(iii) T/(1, rpC+E \ U) C rpC-E ,
(iv) TJ(t,·): X ~ X is an equivariant homeomorphism.
The only difference between this result and Theorem 3.2.3 is that
we must show that the deformation TJ( t, .) can be chosen to be equivariant in

this case in which both the functional sp and the neighborhood U :=> K c are
invariant.
Indeed, since .p is invariant, we may assume by the previous proposition
that ip has an equivariant pseudo-gradient v. Moreover, the invariance of the
neighborhood U :=> K c allows us to choose the cut-off function p : X -----t JR
(used in the proof of Theorem 3.2.1) to be invariant. It suffices to take
dist( u, X\A)
p(u) == - - - - - - dist( u, X\A) + dist( u, B)
and recall that each T(g) is an isometry.

Then, the vector field f(u)
-p(u)v(u)/llv(u)11 is equivariant and, in view of the uniqueness of solution
for the Cauchy problem ~~ == f(w), w(O) == u, we conclude that w(t,') and
TJ( t, .) == w( r5t, .) are equivariant mappings (indeed, if w(t, u) is the solution
of the above Cauchy problem then wg(t) :== T(g)w(t, u) is the solution of the
Cauchy problem with initial condition wg(O) == T(g)u, that is, T(g)w(t, u) ==
w(t, T(g)u)).
D
Now we will assume that, besides an isometric representation {T(g)} of G
in X, we also have a G-index ind : A -----t N U { (X) }. Then, we can "classify"
the compact, invariant subsets of X by defining, for each j == 1,2, ... , the
class

A j == {A c X I A is compact, invariant and ind (A) 2: j } .
And, for a given functional cp : X -----t JR, we define Cj == Cj ( cp), j == 1, 2, ... ,
by the formula
Cj

== inf max <p( u) .
AEA j uEA

(3.1)

(Note that we may have Cj == -00.) Since Al :=> A 2 :=> "', we clearly have

Theorem 3.5. (Basic Abstract Multiplicity Theorem) Let .p E 0 1 (X, JR) be
an invariant functional satisfying (PS). If Cj > -(X) for some j 2: 1, then Cj
is a critical value of .p, More generally, if Ck == Cj == C > -(X) for some k 2: i,
then ind(Kc ) 2: k - j + 1.

Proof: First, we observe that K; is an invariant set, since cp is an invariant
functional, and K; is compact in view of the Palais-Smale condition. We now
show that if Ck == Cj == C > -(X) for some k 2: j, then ind (K c ) 2: k - j + 1.

82

8 Critical Points under Symmetries

Let N ~ K; be a closed, invariant neighborhood such that ind (N)
ind (K c ) , whose existence is implied by property (d) in the definition of Gindex. Then the interior U :== int (N) of N is an open, invariant neighborhood
of K c ' so that we may apply Theorem 3.4 to conclude the existence of E > 0
and TJ E C([O, 1] x X, X) satisfying properties (i)-( iv) of that theorem.
Now, by definition of C == Ck, take A E A k such that max a c.p ::; c + E and
define the compact set B == A\U. Then, properties (b), (c) in the definition
of a G-index imply that

k ::; ind (A)
::; ind (B) + ind (N)
== ind (B)

(3.2)

+ ind (K c ) •

And, since B c c.pC+E\U, we obtain that C == TJ(l, B) c c.pC-E by Theorem 3.4.
On the other hand, since TJ(l,·) is an equivariant mapping and B is a
compact, invariant set, it follows that the set C is also compact and invariant.
And, as we just saw, max.: .p ::; C - E. Therefore, by definition of Cj, we
necessarily have ind (C) ::; j - 1. Moreover, by property (b) in the definition
of a G-index, we have
ind (B) ::; ind (C) ::; j - 1 .

(3.3)

Finally, (3.2) and (3.3) imply that ind (Kc ) ~ k - j + 1, as we wished to show.
D
One of the consequences of the above result is the following theorem due
to Clark:
Theorem 3.6. ([25j) Let c.p E C 1 (X, IR) be an even functional satisfying the
Palais-Smale condition (P S). Suppose that

(i) .p is bounded from below;
(ii) There exists a compact, symmetric set K E A such that ,(K) == k and
sup c < c.p(0) .
K

Then, ip possesses at least k distinct pairs of critical points with corresponding
critical values less than c.p( 0).

Consider the Cj'S defined in (3.1) where, in the present situation,
A j == {A c X I A is compact, symmetric and ,(A) 2 j }:
Proof:

4 Application to a Problem with a Z2-Symmetry

83

Then, (i) implies that Cl == inf x <p > -00 and (ii) implies that Ck < <p(O) .
Therefore, by Theorem 3.5, each Cj is a critical value of ip, If all the Cj' s
(j == 1, ... ,k) are distinct we obtain at least k pairs of critical points with
values less that <p(O). On the other hand, if Ci == Cj == C for some 1 ::; i < j ::; k,
then ,(Kc ) 2:: j - i + 1 2:: 2 and, since 0 ~ K; (as C ::; Ck < <p(O)), Proposition
2.2 (iii) implies that K; possesses infinitely many points in this case.
D

4 Application to a Problem with a Z2-Symmetry
Let us again consider the Dirichlet problem (cf. Application A, Section 4.3)

{

-~u == u 3 in 0
u == 0 on an ,

(4.1)

where 0 C JR3 is bounded domain with smooth boundary. As we know, the
functional

(4.2)
is well defined and of class CIon the Sobolev space X == HJ, and its critical
points are precisely the solutions of (4.1). In Section 4.3 we found a nontrivial
solution through the mountain-pass theorem. We now show that, in fact, (4.1)
has an infinite number of solutions (cf. Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz [9]).

Theorem 4.1. Problem (4.1) has infinitely many (classical) solutions.
The original proof of Ambrosetti and Rabinowitz uses a symmetric version
of the mountain-pass theorem. Here, we shall present another proof (cf. Castro [22]) which uses Clark's Theorem 3.6 applied to an associated functional
1jJ, which is bounded from below and whose set of critical points is related to
the set of critical points of ip, For that, consider the functional
7jJ(u) = (lIVU I2dX) 3

Lemma 4.2. (i) 'l/J is bounded from below;

(i) In view of the Sobolev embedding X == HJ c L 4 , we have

(4.6)
(4.7)
and from (4.6) we conclude that Ilun II is bounded. So, we may assume (passing
to a subsequence, if necessary) that there exist u E X and a ~ 0 such that

Un ~ U weakly in X and Ilun II -+ a. If a == 0 there is nothing to prove. If
a > 0, then Ilu n II > 0 for all n sufficiently large and we can write

Therefore, we conclude from (4.7) that Un -+ 6~4 [0 + T(u)].

Lemma 4.3. If 0 =F U E X is a critical point oj sb, then v == V6fl:11 2 is a

Proof of Theorem 4.1: As we mentioned earlier, we will apply Clark's Theorem
3.6 to the functional 'l/J defined in (4.3). By Lemma 4.2 we know that 'l/J satisfies
condition (PS) and

(i) 'l/J is bounded from below.

Next, given an arbitrary kEN, we will show that

(ii) there exists a compact, symmetric set K E A such that ,(K) == k and
sup 1fJ < 0 .
K

In fact, let Xk == span {¢1, ... ,¢k} be the subspace spanned by the first k
eigenfunctions of the eigenvalue problem -~u == AU in n, u == 0 on an. Then,
since X k is finite dimensional and X k C £4, there exists a > 0 such that

Therefore, we obtain

so, for 0 < Ilulli4 ::; 2~ == J 2 , it follows that

Now, if we define the set K == {u E X k I a2D ::; Ilullx ::; aJ}, then K E A
and sUPK1fJ < O. Moreover, since X k is isomorphic to ]Rk, we may identify K
with a annulus Kin ]Rk, and the inclusions Sk-1(b) eKe ]Rk\{O} (for some
b > 0) show that ,(K) == k. Therefore, condition (ii) is satisfied and Clark's
theorem implies the existence of at least k distinct pairs of critical points for
the functional e. Since k is arbitrary, we obtain infinitely many critical points
for'ljJ.

Finally, in view of Lemma 4.3, we conclude that the functional .p possesses,
together with ib, infinitely many critical points. And, as we know, each critical
point of r..p is a classical solution of problem (4.1).

Problems with an Sl_S y lllllle try

1 A Geometric Sl-index
In this chapter we present an index theory for the case in which G == SI. It is
an extension (cf. [55]) of the geometric SI-index due to Benci [10]. Also see
Fadell-Rabinowitz [41].
Let X be a Banach space and suppose that {T( B) I B E SI } is an isometric
representation of SI in X. As before, we denote by A the class of all closed
subsets of X which are invariant under the given representation, that is,

A == {A c X I A is closed and T(B)A == A VB E SI }.
Proposition 1.1. Given A E A, define ind (A) == k if k is the smallest integer
for which there exists a mapping <t> E C (A, C k \ {O}) and an integer n E N\ {O}
satisfying the relation

it>(T( B)u) == ei n B<t>( u) VB E 51, Vu EX.

(1.1)

Moreover, define ind (A) == 00 in case no such mapping exists, and define
ind (0) == o. Then, ind : A ----+ N U {oo} is an 5 1 -in dex on X.
Proof:

We must verify properties (a)-(d) presented in Section 8.2:

(a) This property is immediate.
(b) We may assume ind (A 2 ) < 00, so that there exists a continuous mapping
it> : A 2 ----+ C k \ {O} and some n E N\{O} satisfying the relation (1.1). From

this and the fact that R : Al ----+ A 2 is an equivariant mapping, we conclude
that \lJ == it> 0 R : Al ----+ C k \ {O} is also continuous and satisfies (1.1). Thus,
ind (AI) :::; k == ind (A 2 ) .

88

9 Problems with an Sl-Symmetry

(c) As before, we may assume that ind (AI) == kl < 00 and ind (A 2 ) == k2 <
Therefore, there exist continuous mappings <I>j : A j ----+ Ckj \ {O} and
nj E N\{O}, j == 1,2, satisfying the relation (1.1). Let <I>j : X ----+ Ckj be
a continuous extension of <I>j obtained by the Tietze extension theorem and
define

we obtain w(A l u A 2 ) C C k1+k 2 \ {O} (since Wj (A j ) == <I>j (A j ) C Ckj \ {O}) so
that

Therefore, we have that W E C(A I U A 2 ,C k l+k 2\ {O}) and W satisfies (1.1)
with n == nln2, and it follows that ind (AI U A 2 ) ::; kl + k2 .
(d) Let ind (A) == k < 00 and consider <I> E C(A, C k \ {O}) and n E N\ {O}
satisfying (1.1). As above, since 0 ~ w(A) == <I>(A) and A is compact by
assumption, there exists <5 > 0 such that 0 ~ w(A 8 ) , where A8 :== {u E
X I dist( u, A) :S b}. Then, the set N == A8 is a closed neighborhood of
A, which is invariant, and ind (N) ::; k by construction. And, since the
inclusion A c N is an equivariant mapping, it follows from property (b) that
k == ind (A) ::; ind (N) . Therefore, ind (N) == ind (A) == k.
D
Next, let us denote by Fix (8 1 ) the (closed) invariant subspace of all elements in X which are fixed by the representation {T(O)}, that is,
Fix (8 1 ) == {u E X I T(O)u == u VB E 8 1 } .
So, u E Fix (51) if and only if the 5 1-orbit O( u) consists of the singleton
{u}. In this case, we necessarily have that ind (u) == 00 since (1.1) cannot be
verified with <I> (u) =I- o. Indeed, in this case (1.1) becomes

hence <I>(u) == o. On the other hand, one has the following
Proposition 1.2. ([55}) If u ~ Fix(8 1 ) , then ind (O(u)) == 1.

1 A Geometric 5 1-index

89

Proof: Since u ~ Fix (Sl), the continuous mapping JR:1 B r--+ T(B)u E X has
minimal period T > 0, i.e., T ==
for some n E N\{O}. Therefore, if we
define <P E C(O(u),C\{O}) by the formula

2:

<p(T(B)u) == ei n 8 ,

D

we see that ind (O(u)) == 1.

Remark 1.1. It follows from the above proposition that if A == O(U1) U
... U O(Uk) with Uj ~ Fix(Sl) Vj == 1, ... k, then ind(A) == 1. Therefore, if
A E A is such that An Fix(Sl) == 0 and ind(A) 2: 2, then the set A contains
necessarily infinitely many orbits (compare with Proposition 8.2.2 (iii), where
Fix(Z2) == {O}).
Remark 1.2. If Y c X is a closed, invariant subspace with a topological
complement, then Y possesses a topological complement which is also invariant. Indeed, it is enough to take Z == Q(X) where

and P : X ----+ Y is the projection onto Y.
In the next section we will prove a multiplicity result for the case of the
above Sl-index. For that, we will need other properties of this Sl-index,
whose detailed proofs can be found in [55, 41] and shall be omitted here. Let
us then present the necessary properties.
Suppose Z C X is a finite-dimensional, invariant subspace such that Z n
Fix (Sl) == {O}. Then, dim Z == 2N is even and there exists an isomorphism
J : Z ----+ C N such that, in Z, T(B) is given by the formula

(1.2)
where

(1.3)
for all B E Sl, (== ((1, ... ,(N) E eN and some k j E N\{O}, j == 1, ... ,N.
Proposition 1.3. (cf. [55}) (i) Let Y C X be a finite-dimensional, invariant

subspace and let A C X be a closed, invariant subspace. If Fix(Sl) C Y and
AnY == 0, then codim Y is even and

ind (A) < 2"codim Y ;

(ii) Let Z c X be a finite-dimensional, invariant subspace and let D c Z be
an open neighborhood of 0 which is invariant. If Z n Fix(5 1 ) == {O}, then
dim Z is even and

1

ind (aD) == 2" dim Z .
Proof:

(i) Let Z be an invariant, topological complement of Y (cf. Remark

1.2). Then dim Z == 2N and T(B) is defined on Z by (1.2) and (1.3). Consider
the continuous mapping <I> == <I> 0 J : Z\ {O} ----+ C N \ {O}, where

<I>(() ==

.c.... ,(~N), (E CN\{O} ,
n

and n is the minimum common multiple of k 1 , ... ,kN given in (1.3). Then,
in view of (1.2) and (1.3), we have that <I> satisfies property (1.1). Therefore,

1
1
ind(Z\{O})::; 2" dim Z == 2"codim Y .

(1.4)

On the other hand, since AnY == 0, we obtain P(A) C Z\{O} where P :
X ----+ Z is the projection onto Z along Y. Therefore, since P is equivariant
(because Y and Z are invariant). Property (b) in the definition of a G-index
(Section 8.2) implies that
(1.5)

ind (A) ::; ind (Z\ {O}) .
Combining (1.4) and (1.5) we obtain ind (A) ::; ~codim Y.

(ii) Let Y be an invariant, topological complement of Z. Then, since
Z n Fix (51) == {O}, we obtain Fix (51) C Y. Moreover, we have
n Y == 0.

m:

Therefore, part (i) above implies that ind (aD) ::; ~codim Y == ~ dim Z. On
the other hand, we have ind (aD) 2: ~ dim Z (cf. [55]). Thus, ind (aD) ==
~ dim Z.
D

2 A Multiplicity Result
We now present a multiplicity result in the case of an 5 1 -index (cf. [30]).
Theorem 2.1. Let .p E C 1 (X,IR) be an invariant functional satisfying the
Palais-Smale condition (P5). Suppose Y, Z c X are closed, invariant subspaces such that codim Y < dim Z and

(i) infy'P == a > -00;
(ii) sUPaDr'P == b < +00 for some r > 0, where 8D r == {u E Z Illull == r};

(iii) 'P (u) > b whenever 'P'(u) == 0, u E Fix (8 1 ) ;
(iv) Fix (8 1 ) c Y, Z n Fix (8 1 ) == {O}

Then, there exist at least m == ~ (dim Z - codim Y) distinct orbits of critical
points of 'P outside Fix (8 1 ) with critical values in the interval [a, b].
Proof: Let p == ~codim Y. If j 2: p + 1 then (i) implies

AEA j

(2.1)

since AnY i= 0 for any A E A j (Indeed, if A E A j is such that AnY == 0
then (iv) and Proposition 1.3 (i) imply that ind (A) :S ~codim Y == p, hence
j :S ind (A) :S p).
Let q :== ~ dim Z and consider the open ball in Z, Dr == {u E Z IIlull < r},
so that ind (8D r ) == q, in view of (iv) and Proposition 1.3 (ii). If j :S q, then
(ii) implies
Cj

== inf sUP'P:S sUP'P == b < +00 .
AEA j

(2.2)

Therefore, combining (2.1) and (2.2) gives a :S Cj :S b for each j == p +
1, ... ,q, that is,
-00

< a :S Cp+1 :S ... :S cq :S b < +00 .

It follows from Theorem 8.3.5 that each Cj (j == p+ 1, ... ,q) is a critical value
of 'P. If all of these cjs are distinct we obtain at least m == q - p distinct orbits
of critical points of 'P, which lie outside Fix (51) in view of (iii). On the other
hand, if c, == Cj for some p + 1 ~ i < j ~ q, then ind (Kc ) 2: j - i + 1 2: 2
and, since K; n Fix (51) == 0 by (iii), we conclude from Remark 1.1 that K;
has infinitely many orbits in this case.
D
Remark 2.1. The first result of the above type is due to Clark [25], where the
group Z2 is considered (cf. Theorem 8.3.6). When Y == X and Fix(8 1 ) == {O},
the above Theorem 2.1 is due to Ekeland and Lasry [38]. Also see [11] for
situations in which dim Fix (8 1 ) is finite.
Remark 2.2. Since the critical values Cj obtained in Theorem 2.1 belong to
the interval [a, b], where a == infy'P, b == maxaDr 'P, it suffices that a local
(P5) condition be satisfied.

In this section we will apply the multiplicity theorem of the previous section to

the equation

and the corresponding eigenfunctions belong to Loo(O; JRN) ;

[Note that, from the arguments used in Example C of Chapter 2.1, conditions (h 2 ) and (h 3 ) imply that \7 F maps V continuously into V.]
\l F : V ------+ V and L : D (L) n V ------+ V are equivariant under the isometric

T(8)D(L) c D(L) and LT(8)u == T(8)Lu.

Note that (h4 ) implies that Fix (SI) is an invariant subspace under the
operator L and the restriction L o of L to Fix (SI) is an equivariant selfadjoint
operator with spectrum a(L o) C a(L).

Remark 3.1. If O'(L o) c (-00,0], then (h6 ) is satisfied in view of (hI)' Moreover, (h3 ) implies (h7 ) since, in this case, \7F - La is strictly monotone on

D(L o).
For the proof of Theorem 3.1 we will need some preliminary facts.
Let X be the orthogonal complement of N(L) in V. From (hI), the operator - L : D(L) n X -----+ X possesses a compact inverse K : X -----+ X.

On the other hand, since F(O) == 0, we have F(u) == fo (\7 F(tu), u) dt, and
it follows from (h2 ) that, given 6 < 61 < min {I - An, An+1 - I }, there exists
Ql > 0 such that

Therefore, in view of (h3 ) and Remark 7.1.2, the Legendre-Fenchel transform
G == F* is a strictly convex function of class C l satisfying

G(v) dx .

Lemma 3.2. (i) If v E X is a critical point of ({J, then u == \7G(v) is a
solution of (*). Moreover, if Ul == \7G (VI) and U2 == \7G (V2) belong to the

(ii) cp satisfies the Palais-Smale condition (PS);

(iii) There exist A* > An+k and E > 0 such that

Proof: (i) We have already seen in Section 7.3 that, if v E X is a critical
point of cp, then u == \7G(v) E D(L) is a solution of (*) (cf. Remark 7.3.2).
Now, if Ul and U2 belong to the same orbit, then U2 == T(O)Ul for some 0 E SI
and, therefore, in view of (h4 ) and the fact that \7G == (\7 F)-I, we obtain

that is, VI and V2 belong to the same orbit;

(ii) Let (vm ) C X be such that rp/(v m ) -+ 0, that is,

where P is the orthogonal projection onto N(L). Defining U m == PV'G(v m ) -

K V m , we obtain by duality that V m == V'F( U m + fm), or LU m == V'F( U m + fm),
since LU m == V m . Now, assumption (h2 ) implies
IIUmllv :S II(L -,)-111{ 6(llumllv + Ilfmllv) + alf21 + ,llfmllv}
where II (L - , )-111 == max {(,- An )- I , (An +l _,)-1} < 6- 1. Therefore, since

Ilfmllv -+ 0, we obtain that lIu m llv is bounded. In view of the linear growth
of V'F and V'G (cf. (3.3) in the proof of Proposition 7.3.1), we conclude that

Vm

== V'F(u m + fm) and V'G(vm ) are also bounded in V. Therefore, passing

to a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that V m ~ v weakly in X and
PV' G (vm ) -+ wEN(L), since N (L) is finite dimensional by (hI). Since K is
a compact operator, we obtain that K V m -+ K v in X, so that

Therefore, V m -+ v in X.

(iii) The proof follows from assumption (hs ) and was already done during the
proof of Lemma 7.4.3. Indeed, (hs ) implies that there exist 6 > and A* >

E > 0 such that IV'G(v)1 :S c5 for Ivi :S E. Therefore, since G(v) == (u, v) - F(u)

Proof of Theorem 3.1: We will apply Theorem 2.1 to the dual action rp E
C l (X, lR), which is invariant by assumption (h4 ) and satisfies (PS) by Lemma
3.2(ii) above. Let us define the following subspaces of X:

Y == [N(L - AO) EB

EB N(L - An)].l ,

Z == N(L - AI) EB

EB N(L - An+k) .

Then, we have Fix (51) n X c Y and Z n Fix (51) == {O} in view of assumption
(h6 ) , so that condition (iv) of Theorem 2.1 is satisfied.
Now, through eigenfunction expansion of the elements of Y, we obtain the
estimate

which, combined with (3.1), gives

Therefore, since r + 61 < An + 1, it follows that .p is bounded from below on Y
and condition (i) of Theorem 2.1 is satisfied.
In order to verify condition (ii), we again use eigenfunction expansion to
obtain the following estimate in Z,

exists r > 0 such that sUPaDr .p == b < 0, where Dl); == {v E Z I IIvll == r}.
Therefore, condition (ii) of Theorem 2.1 is also satisfied.
Finally, if v E Fix(5 1 ) is a critical point of .p, then u == \7G( v) E D(L) is
a solution of (*) (cf. Lemma 3.2) and, by the equivariance of \7G == (\7F)-l
(assumption (h4 ) ) , it follows that also u E Fix (51). Therefore, (h7 ) implies

u == 0, so that v == \7F( u) == 0 and r.p( v) == O. This shows that condition (iii)
of Theorem 2.1 is satisfied. Therefore, that theorem gives the existence of at

where 0 is the unit disk in lR 2 • Other applications can be found in [30].
Let A be the operator -~ on the space V == L 2(0, lR) with Dirichlet
boundary condition, that is, D(A) == H 2 (0 ) n HJ(O) and Au == -~u 'rIu E
D(A). The eigenvalues of A are of the form J-l == v 2 , where v is a positive
zero of some Bessel function of the first kind, I n , n == 0,1,2 ... (see CourantHilbert [34], Vol. II). If n 2: 1, the corresponding eigenfunctions are given in
polar coordinates (r, 0) by
J n (vr ) cos nO,

J n ( vr) sin nO .

If v is a zero of J o, then Jo(vr) is a (radially symmetric) eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue J-l == v 2. Therefore, if we denote the spectrum
of A by a(A) == {J-l1, J-l2,"'}' with 0 < J-l1 < J-l2 < "', then each eigenvalue
is either simple or of even multiplicity: in fact, the nonsimple eigenvalues are
double, since a result of C. Siegel (cf. [73], pg. 485) implies that the positive

Then, Problem (4.1) possesses at least k weak solutions which are non-radially
symmetric and geometrically distinct (two solutions are geometric distinct if
one is not a rotation of the other).
Proof:

Denote by L the operator A - J-lp on the space V == £2(0, lR)

with Dirichlet boundary condition, and define F(u) E C 1 (lR, lR) by F(u) ==
Iou g(s) ds - ~J-lpU2 and f == F'. Then, assumption (4.2) and the fact that
g(O) == 0 imply (h3 ) and, since a(L) == {J-lj - J-lp I j == 1,2, ... }, we also obtain
(h2 ) and (hs) from (4.3).
On the other hand, consider the isometric representation of 8 1 on V defined by the rotations in 0, that is,

(T(O)u)(x) == u(R(O)x) ,

where R(B)x == R(B) (Xl, X2) == (Xl COS B- X2 sin B, Xl sin B+ X2 cos B). Then, it
is clear that Land F' are equivariant, so that (h4 ) is also satisfied. And, since
Fix (8 1 ) is the space of radially symmetric function, condition (h6 ) is satisfied
because each Aj == /Lj+p - /Lp, j == 1, ... ,q - 1- p, is a double eigenvalue of L.
Finally, in order to verify (h7 ) , we observe that (4.2) implies that fSu ) <
/Lq - J-Lp for all u =I- 0, that is,

Therefore, if u =I- 0 is a radially symmetric solution of (4.1), we obtain

IIf(u)lli2 < (J-Lq - J-Lp)(f(u), U)L2 == (J-Lq - J-Lp)(Lu, U)L2
::; II Lu lli 2== Ilf(u) IIi2 .
This absurdity implies that (h7 ) is also satisfied.
Therefore, Theorem 3.1 guarantees the existence of at least k nonradially

Problems with Lack of Compactness

1 Introduction
In this chapter and the next we will present two examples of situations in which
the variational problem under consideration lacks some desirable compactness
properties. Typically, lack of compactness is due to the action of a group under
which the pertinent functional is invariant. For example, an autonomous
semilinear elliptic equation in the whole space JRN,
(1.1)

-~u+u==h(u),

is invariant under the group of translations u(-) f---t u(· + z), z E JRN. We will
be considering one such situation in this chapter.
Now, in case Problem (1.1) is posed in a bounded domain n c JRN, N 2: 3,
a lack of compactness can happen when, for example, the nonlinearity h(u)
has a critical growth at the limiting exponent q == 2* - 1 :== (N + 2)j(N - 2)
for the Sobolev embedding HI (JRN) ~ £2* (JRN).
Both situations and generalizations have been extensively considered in
the literature through the use of the concentration-compactness method of P.L. Lions [51, 52]. The reader is invited to learn how this method is used in the
above original papers. In this chapter, when considering our example in the
whole space JRN, we shall neither use the concentration-compactness method
per se, nor shall we be concerned with making the best possible assumptions
on h. Instead, we will impose additional restrictions on the nonlinearity h
which will allow us to consider the associated Nehari set

<pIM are precisely the critical points of ip. In particular, we can find a solution
of Problem (1.1) via global minimization on M (as in Chapter 6). Such a solution is called a ground-state solution since it has the least possible nonzero
energy <.p(u).
We point out that, in fact, all that is needed in order to obtain a solution
of Problem (1.1) through constrained minimization is to have h sub critical
satisfying H( () > ~(2 for some ( > 0 (cf. the original paper [14, Part I] of
Berestycki and Lions). Under these minimal assumptions, a solution of (1.1)
is found in [14] through the constrained minimization problem of finding the
global minimum of

We start with preliminary results involving two beautiful lemmas due to
Brezis and Lieb [19] and to Lions [51], respectively, and which deal with the
question of when a weakly convergent LP-sequence is strongly convergent. As
usual, in what follows we will be denoting by 2* the limiting exponent in the
Sobolev embedding HI (JRN) <:--+ LP(JRN), 2 < p < 2*, namely, 2* == 2N/(N-2)
if N ~ 3 and 2* == 00 if N == 1,2.

2 Two Beautiful Lemmas
As is well known, given a domain 0 C JRN and a bounded sequence (un)
of functions in LP(O) (1 < P < (0) one can extract a subsequence (still
denoted by Un, for simplicity) which converges weakly and pointwisely to
some U E LP(O). In addition the Fatou lemma gives

with equality occurring if and only if Un converges strongly to U in LP(O).
As it turns out, Brezis and Lieb obtained a refinement of the Fatou lemma
in [19] by showing that the difference Ilunllip - lIullip behaves exactly like
llun - ulltp as n ~ 00. In other words, they found the missing term in the
inequality of the Fatou lemma by proving that

Their proof essentially uses the fact that the continuous function H(s) :== IslP
satisfies the following property:

VE > 0 3CE > 0 with IH(s + t) - H(s)1 :s; EH(s) + CEH(t) Vs, t E IR .
(2.1)
Indeed, as mentioned in [19], the result holds for more general functions and
we shall state it here in a more general form.

Proof: We first note that when (un) is a bounded sequence in LP(O) the

suitable subsequence of (un)).
In view of condition (2.1) one has the estimate

The result follows since E > 0 was arbitrary.

D

Remark 2.1. As pointed out in [19], condition (2.1) is satisfied by general
convex functions. On the other hand, let H : JR ---t JR be continuous and

102

10 Problems with Lack of Compactness

satisfy H(s) > 0 for s i- O. And suppose that H(s) behaves asymptotically as
pure powers as lsi ---+ 0 and as lsi ---+ 00 in the sense that, for some 0 < p, q <
00, one has

Then it can be shown (cf. [32]) that H(s) also satisfies condition (2.1).
Next, we consider a lemma by Lions [51] which gives conditions guaranteeing strong LP-convergence of a weakly convergent LP-sequence arising from a
bounded HI-sequence of functions.
Lions Lemma. Suppose Un E HI (~N) is a bounded sequence satisfying

Proof: We only consider the case N 2:: 3 and reproduce the proof as given
in [75]. Let p < s < 2* be given and consider () E (0, 1) defined by

by picking () == ~. Next, if we consider a covering of ~N by balls B == Br(y)

since 2 < s < 2*, we conclude (again by the Holder and Sobolev inequalities)
that Urn ----+ 0 in Lq(~N) for 2 < q < 2*.

3 A Problem in jRN
As a first application of a problem lacking compactness, we consider a subcritical elliptic problem in all of IR N :
(3.1)
In the literature, such an equation is called a field equation in the positive

mass case (because of the term u in the left-hand side of the equation), an
important example being that when h(u) is a pure power. Below we list some
of the assumptions on the nonlinearity h( s) that will be made in the course
of this section, where we will always be assuming that N 2: 3. As usual,

J;

we denote H (s) ==
h(t) dt and, for simplicity of notation, all integrals are
understood as taken over all of IR N, unless otherwise stated:

h E Cl(~) satisfies h(O) = 0, 1imlsl->o 1~~1~)1 < +00 for some fJ > 0, and
lim sup Ilhll~~)21 < +00 for some 2 < P < 2* ;
181-+00 S

H(s) and [sh(s) - 2H(s)] are strictly convex functions with
.

H(s)

lim - - == +00.
181-+00 s2

Remark 3.1. In view of (h l ) we note that the functional

is well defined and of class C 2 on HI Cffi. N ) , with its critical points being precisely the solutions of (3.1). Moreover, Problem (3.1) has the trivial solution
u == 0 and lacks compactness in the sense that, for any nontrivial solution v,
the sequence vn(x) :== v(x + zn) with Zn E JRN satisfying IZnl --t 00 (so that
Ilvnll == Ilvll and V n ~ 0 weakly in Hl(JRN)) has the property that

but no subsequence of V n converges strongly in Hl(JRN) . In particular, (jJ
does not satisfy (P S)c for c == (jJ(v).

Remark 3.2. Since we are assuming h(O) == 0 it is not hard to see that (h2 )
implies (in fact, is equivalent to):

104

10 Problems with Lack of Compactness

(h2) h(s) is strictly increasing with limlsl-too H(s)/S2 == +00 and
h(s)
2H(s)
h' (s) > > -S2- > 0 Vs yf 0 .
S
In particular, any such h is superlinear in the sense that limls!-too h(s)/s ==

+00 (in fact, limls!-too h'(s) == +(0), and we also have that
h'(S)S2_h(s)s>O ifsyfO.
Remark 3.3. A typical example of a function satisfying (hI) and (h 2) is the
pure power s 1---+ alsl p - 2s, with 2 < P < 2* and some a > 0 or, more generally,
the function

with 2 < p, q < 2* and a, b > O. Still another example of a function (with a
much slower growth) but satisfying the same conditions above is given by

h(s) == H'(s) , H(s) == s2ln (1 + s2) .
On the other hand, the first two examples satisfy the stronger superlinear
Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz (global) condition

sh(s) ~ (}H(s) > 0 for s i- 0 (and some () > 2)
whereas the last one does not.
Under some suitably mild condition on h (say h continuous with Ih(s) I <
Aisl + Blslp-1 for some A, B > 0 and 2 < P S 2N/(N - 2) if N ~ 3), we can
define the so-called N ehari set

Of course, we may have M == 0. However, if U E HI(JR..N) is a nonzero weak
solution of (3.1) then U E M.

Lemma 3.1. Assume (hI). Iflimlsl-tooh(s)/s == +00 (h is superlinear) and
)'(s) :== sh(s) - 2H(s) is a strictly convex function, then
(i) M i- 0 is a C'<submanijold of HI (JR..N) of codimension 1 and 0 tf. M;

(ii) M is a natural constraint for ip, that is, 0 i- u E HI (JRN) is a critical

point of <p if and only if u E M and u is a critical point of <pIM.

Proof: (i) In view of (hI), the functional e is clearly of class C 2 on HICffi. N ) .
Let 0 -I- v E HI (IR N) and consider the function 0 < t r-+ 1/J(tv). Again, in
view of (hI) and Sobolev embedding we claim that 1/J(tv) > 0 for t > 0 small.
Indeed, we have

}v12 dx + ~ CEltJP }v 1P dx

I jh(tv)tv dxl < Et2

p

1

< Et 2 11v l12 + DEltIPllv/l P
so that, by picking 0 < E < 1, we obtain

for all t > 0 sufficiently small.
Similarly, it is not hard to see that the superlinearity of h together with
the fact that h(8)8 ~ 0 imply that limt---+oo 1/J(tv) == - ex). Therefore, there
exists t such that tv E M. In particular, M -I- 0.
Next, from the strict convexity of ,(8) == 8h(8) - 2H(8) we have

" (8) == 8h' (8) - h (8) < 0 if s < 0 ,
,'(8) == sh' (8) - h( 8) > 0 if 8 > 0 ,
hence

h'(s) > h(s)

Vs#-O .

(3.2)

We claim that 1/J' (u) -I- 0 for all u EM. Indeed, if u E M is such that

1/J'(u) . w = 2(u, w) - jh(U)W dx - jh'(U)UW dx = 0
for all W E HI(IR N ) , then, by picking w == u, it follows that

so that

211uI1 2 > 2 jh(U)U dx ,
in view of (3.2). This is in contradiction with the fact that u E M. Therefore,
M is a CI-submanifold of HI (IR N ) of codimension 1.
We now show that 0 ~ M. As before, (hI) and Sobolev embedding imply,
for u E M and E > O~

Therefore, 0 t/:. M.

(ii) Let 0 =1= u E HI (JRN) be a critical point of ip. Then,
<p'(u) . W = (u,w) - jh(U)W dx = 0 't/w E H 1(JRN ) ,
and choosing w == u yields

IIuI1 2 - !h(U)U dx = 0 ,
that is, u E M. Conversely, if u E M is a critical point of cpIM, then
cp' (u) == A~' (u )

for some Lagrange multiplier A E JR, that is,

(u,W) - !h(U)W dx =,A [2(U,w) - !h(U)W dx - !h'(U)UW dX]
for all W E HI(JRN). Once again, choosing w == u and recalling that u E M
we obtain

o = 2,Allu11 2 -,A [!h(U)U dx + !h'(u)u 2 -

,

or,

2,Allu11 2 = ,A [!h(U)U dx + !h'(u)u 2 dX] .
Since the above expression in square brackets is greater than 2 Jh( u)u dx by
(3.2), we necessarily must have A == 0 in order not to contradict the fact that
u E M. Thus u is a critical point of ip.

(i) There exists a, 8 > 0 such that <p(u) 2: a if Ilull == 8;
(ii) There exists Vo E HI (JRN) such that Ilvoll > 8 and <p(vo) :S o.
Indeed, as in Lemma 3.1, using (hI) and Sobolev inequality yields (with 0 <
£

< 1)

Therefore (i) holds true with Ilull == 8 > 0 sufficiently small so that the righthand side a == (1 - £)82 / 2 - D E 8P of the above inequality is positive.
Similarly, as in Lemma 3.1, we obtain (ii) from the fact that, for each
oi= v E HI(JR N), we have
lim <p( tv) == -00 .

Moreover, as also observed before, the strict convexity of [h(s)s-2H(s)] gives

Vs f. 0 .

This in turn means that the function s f---+ h(s)/ s is strictly decreasing on
(-00,0] and strictly increasing on [0,(0). Therefore, for each fixed Ilwll == 1,
the real-valued function

has a unique critical point i == i(w) > 0 (its global maximum). And since
i == jh(iw)w dx, we can characterize the Nehari manifold as follows:

M == { i(w)w I Ilwll == 1 } .
Next, letting r :== { 1 E C([O, 1], HI(JRN)) 11(0) == 0, <P(1(1)) < 0 }, it
follows from (i), (ii) that the mountain-pass level of <p

In fact, in our present case, we have the equality

Lemma 3.4. Assume (hI). Given any minimizing sequence (un) [or c., there
exists another minimizing sequence (vn ) such that I \7<.p (vn ) I == o( 1).

Proof: Let (un) be a minimizing sequence for c*. Then, (un) is bounded by
Lemma 3.3 and, in view of the Ekeland variational principle [37] (see Appendix
and Corollary A.3), there exists another minimizing sequence (vn ) for c, such
that

bounded sequence. The rest of the proof is somewhat technical and consists
in showing that
for some other bounded minimizing sequence (vn ) , as required. We start with
the following
Claim 1: 11\7<p(vn)1I and 11\7'ljJ(Vn) II are bounded.

Indeed, let 2t == 2N/(N + 2) be the conjugate exponent of 2* and let
A == (-~ + 1)-1 : L 2 t C H- 1 ~ HI C L 2 * be the bounded linear operator
defined by (Af, z) :== (f, Z)2 Vz E HI. Then, we have

\7<p(u) == u - A(h(u)) ,
\71/J(u) == 2u - A(h(u) + h'(u)u) ,
so that (hI) yields

Similarly, we have

IIA(h'(u)u)11 :::; C(llull + lIuII P - 1 ) .
Therefore, Claim 1 follows since Ilvn I is bounded.
Next, taking the inner-product of PTvnM\7<P(Vn) with \7<p(vn ) and keeping
in mind that 1I\7<p(vn)1I is bounded, we obtain

that is,

Similarly, taking the inner-product of PT vn M \Jr..p(vn) with V n and recalling
that (\Jr..p(vn),v n) == 'ljJ(v n) == 0 (since V n EM), we obtain

Claim 2:

Lack of Compactness for Bounded n

In this chapter we present a simple situation of a variational problem on a
bounded domain 0 C ffi.N for which the corresponding functional does not
satisfy the Palais-Smale condition (PS)c at certain levels c E ffi.. We are
referring to the so-called strongly resonant problems, a terminology introduced
in Bartolo-Benci-Fortunato [8] for a resonant problem where the nonlinearity

g(s) was such that limlsl-+oo g(s) == 0 and limlsl-+oo G(s) == f3 < 00. Such
problems did not fall under the Landesman-Lazer [49] or the Ahmad-LazorPaul [3] framework. In [8], the authors used the weaker version of (PS) due to
Cerami [24] in order to handle those problems (see condition (Ce) introduced
in Exercise 2 at the end of Chapter 3). Here, we introduce a large class of
strongly resonant problems and show that the standard (PS) condition can be
used to handle such problems by determining the exact levels c E ffi. where it
fails. We follow [7].

1 (PS)c for Strongly Resonant Problems
Let us consider the Dirichlet problem

-~u == AkU + g(x, u)

(1.1 )

where 0 is a bounded domain in ffi.N, N ~ 3, Ak is an eigenvalue of -~ in 0
with a Dirichlet boundary condition and 9 : 0 x ffi. ~ ffi. is a Caratheodory
function with subcritical growth. We call (1.1) a strongly resonant problem
(at Ak) if the following conditions hold:

Ig(x,s)1 ::; h(x) for some h : Lq(O), q ~ ~~2' and g(x,s) ~ 0 as Isl-t

(g2)
We remark that (gl), (g2) hold if, for example, limlsl~oo g(x, s) == 0 and
limlsl~oo G(x, s) == Goo E (-00, +(0), uniformly for x E O. Such a situation is
in sharp contrast with the one considered by Ahmad-Lazer-Paul (see Section
3 of Chapter 5), in which one had G± == +00 (or G± == -(0). Indeed, the
following lemma characterizes the values c E ffi. at which the functional

cp(u) = ~ { (lV'uI 2 - AkU2) dx - ( G(x, u) dx

in
== q(u) - N(u) , u E HJ(O)

(1.2)

corresponding to (1.1) satisfies (PS)c. Moreover, it explains why (PS)c holds
true for all c E ffi. in the Ahmad-Lazer-Paul situation.

Since 9 has subcritical growth, the functional ep satisfies (PS)c if and only
if any sequence {un} C HJ such that

(i) <p( un) -----7 C,

(iii) IIU n II -----7 00,

u~ E X O == Ni: and using (ii), we have!

positive and negative parts of u.

where En == 11<p'(un)IIH-l ---+ O. Using (91) and the fact that q' :s 2N/(N -2),
if N 2: 3 (where q' == q/ (q - 1) denotes the conjugate exponent of q), we can
estimate the integral term above as

in view of the Holder and Sobolev inequalities. Therefore, (1.3) gives

so that {u~} is bounded in HJ. Similarly, we show that {u;;,} is also bounded.
Thus, by (iii), we must have Ilu~11 ----t 00 and, letting Un :== un/llu~ll, it follows
that Un ---+ V E Ni. with IIvll == 1. Without loss of generality, we may assume
that un(x) ---+ v(x) a.e. in Sl. Therefore,

un(x) ---+ +00 a.e. in [v > 0] :== {x E Sl I v(x) > O} ,
un(x) ---+ -00 a.e. in [v < 0] :== {x E Sl I v(x) < O} .
Next, by (92), we can apply the Lebesgue theorem to the sequence
G(x, un(x)) to obtain
lim {G(x,un(x))dx= {
n~oo in

{
G_(x)dx.
i.- G+(x)dx+ i.:

Therefore, in order to show that c E f k , it suffices to verify that Ilu;11 ---+ o.
For that, we prove that the integral term in (1.3) (as well as the corresponding
integral term in 1(\7 <p(un), u;;,) I) goes to zero.
Indeed, using the Holder inequality and Sobolev embedding as in (1.4), we
obtain (with q ~ 2N/(N + 2) if N ~ 3)

and, since g(x, un(x)) ---+ 0 a.e in n with Ig(x, un(x))1 s h(x) a.e in Sl in
view of (gl), an application of the Lebesgue theorem once more implies the
desired result that c E f k if (i)-(iii) hold.
On the other hand, we also observe that <p does not satisfy (PS)c if c E fk.
Indeed, taking v E Ni: Ilvll ==.1, we have

Remark 1.1. Note that in the special case when G±(x) == G± (constants)
and Ak is a simple eigenvalue, say Ni. == span{ 'Pk} with II'Pk II == 1, the set f k
has only two values (or perhaps one, if they coincide):

where Qk == 1['Pk > 0]1, (3k == 1['Pk < 0]1· Moreover, if k == 1, we get

where we are denoting the measure of a set S by lSI.

2 A Class of Indefinite Problems
In preparation for our existence result in the next section concerning a class
of strongly resonant problems, we present in this section some preliminary
results involving an elliptic problem with an indefinite linear part and an almost monotone nonlinearity. More precisely, we consider our previous Problem (1.1) in a bounded domain 0 C JRN where the nonlinearity g(x, u) is a
Caratheodoru subcritical function satisfying the lower estimate

(g(x, s) - g(x, t))(s - t) 2: -6(s - t)2, a.e. x E f2, Vs, t E JR,

(go)

for some 0 < 6 < Ak - Ak-I, k 2: 2 (if k == 1 we only assume that Al > 6 > 0).
Here we are numbering the eigenvalues of (-~, HJ (0)) allowing repetition,
but the above consecutive indices are taken such that Ak-I < Ak.
Remark 2.1. Note that (go) simply means that the right-hand side f(x, u) ==
AkU + g(x, u) of (1.1) is a monotone function which does not interact with the

2 A Class of Indefinite Problems

119

eigenvalues AI, ... Ak-I. Therefore, in the present situation, it is natural to use
the so-called Liapunov-Schmidt decomposition method to study our problem.
As we shall see, this will reduce our pertinent indefinite functional

on X :== HJ (0) to another functional7jJ( v) on a closed subspace V of X whose
critical points are in a one-to-one correspondence with the critical points of
cp( u). In addition, for the class of strongly resonant problems to be considered
in the next section, the reduced functional 7jJ( v) will turn out to be bounded
from below.
For our preliminary results, let us consider the previous orthogonal decomposition X == X- EB X O EB X+, where X O == Ni. == N(L - Ak) is the kernel
of the operator L : HJ(O) - - - t HJ(O) defined in (2.1), and X+ (resp. X-)
denotes the subspace where L is positive definite (resp. negative definite).
We denote the respective orthogonal projections by Po, P+ and P_. Finally
we will let
V == X O EB X+,
W == X- ,
so that X == V EB W, and we will write Pv == Po + P+, Pw == P_ for the
corresponding orthogonal projections.
Lemma 2.1. Assume (go). Then, for each v == uo + U+ E V, the functional
W :3 W r----t -cp(w + v) is u-conuex on W, that is, the mapping

Now, in view of Lemma 2.1 and a classical result for tt-monotone maps
(see [4, 22]), for each v E V there exists a unique w == O(v) E W such that

Pw \7 <p(0(v) + v) == 0 .
Moreover, it is shown in [4, 22] that the map V ::1 v f------+ O(v) E W is continuous, the functional

1/;(v) == <p(O(v) + v) == sup <p(w + v)

is of class C 1 (together with rp), and

"Vrp(u) == 0 if and only if u == B(v) + v and "V1jJ(v) == 0 .

Remark 2.2. Unlike in the usual Liapunov-Schmidt reductions, note that
our reduced functional to is defined on the infinite-dimensional space V.
Lemma 2.2. The reduced[unctiotial sb : V ----+ ffi. is weakly l.s.c ..

Proof:

It suffices to observe that

1jJ(.) == sup <p(w + .)

is weakly lower-semicontinuous on V.

Still considering our original Problem (1.1) with the nonlinearity 9 being almost monotone (i.e., satisfying condition (go)), we observe that the functional

(3.1)

is bounded from below whenever limsuPs----t±oo G(x.s) < +00 uniformly a.e.
x E O. In fact, we are going to assume that 9 : 0- x IR -----t IR is continuous
and satisfies
limlsl----too g(x, s) == 0 uniformly for a.e. x EO,
limlsl----too G(x, s) == 0 uniformly for a.e. x EO,
so that Problem (1.1) is a strongly resonant problem at the eigenvalue Ak.

Lemma 3.1. Assume 9 satisfies (go) (i.e., 9 is almost monotone).

(i) If g(x, 0) == 0, then 'ljJ(0) == 0;
(ii) If (g2) holds, then 'ljJ( uo) -----t 0 as Iluo I ~ 00, u O E XO == N k .
Proof:

(i) Since u == 0 is a solution of Problem (1.1), we have by (2.2) that

\l~(0) == 0, hence v == 0, B(O) ==

o. In particular, 'ljJ(0) == o.

(ii) Let us recall the definition of N(u) and the quadratic form q(u) in (1.2).
Then

since q(un) == O. On the other hand, we have

7jJ( un) == sup cp( w + un) 2: cp( uo).

Therefore, it follows from (3.2) that

hence
(3.3)
which shows that Iq(O(uO))1 is bounded in view of (92). Since -q is coercive
on W, we conclude that
(3.4)
Next, we prove the following

Claim: limlluoll---+oo N(O(uO) + un) == limlluoll---+oo N(uO) == o.
Indeed, assuming Ilu~11 ----+ 00, we have in view of (3.4) that

hence

IIO( u~) + u~ I ----+ 00 .
Letting V n :== (O(u~) + u~)/IIO(u~) + u~11 E WEB N(L - Ak) and recalling that
W EBN(L- Ak) is finite dimensional, we may assume (passing to a subsequence,
if necessary) that V n ----+ v for some v E WEB N(L - Ak) with Ilvll == 1. Thus
v(x) ¢. 0 a.e. and O( u~) + u~ ----+ +00 on [v > 0] (resp. O( u~) + u~ ----+ -00
on [v

In view of (92), an application of Lebesgue's theorem gives

limlluoll---+oo N(O(uO) +uO) == O. Similarly, we show that limlluoll---+oo N(uO) == 0,
which proves the claim.
Finally, from (3.3), (3.2), and the above claim we conclude that
lim 7jJ( un) == 0 .

We are now ready to prove the main existence result of this section.
Theorem 3.2. Let g(x, 0) == 0, so that u == 0 is a solution of (1.1). If (go),
(gl), and (g2) hold then (1.1) has a nonzero solution u E HJ .

Proof: In view of Lemma 1.1 the functional c satisfies (PS)c for all c =1= O. It
follows from Lemma 2.3 that the reduced functional to : V ---+ IR also satisfies
(PS)c for all c =1= 0 and, from Lemma 3.1(i), that
m ~ 7/J(0) == 0 .

Case 1: m < o. In this case, since 7/J satisfies (PS)m, we have that m < 0 ==
7/J(O) is a critical value of 7/J, that is, there exists v E V such that

7/;(v) == m < 0

,

\l7/J(v) == 0 .

In particular, v =1= 0 since 7/J(O) == 0 by Lemma 3.1(i). It follows from (2.2)
that

\l4J( O(v) + v) == 0 ,
that is, U == O(v) + v =1= 0 is a solution of (1.1).

Case 2: m == O. In this case fix R > 0 and note that, by (3.5), we have

11 Lack of Compactness for Bounded [2

If tn n == 0, then 1jJ(~) == 0 for some VR == u~ + u~ E CR. Since we are
assuming in this case that m == inf v E v 1jJ(v) == 0, we conclude that VR # 0
is a critical point of 1jJ and, as in Case 1, that UR == (}(VR) + VR is a nonzero
solution of (1.1).
On the other hand, let us assume that ttin > o. Then, by Lemma 3.1(ii),
there exists

Consider the class of all paths in V joining 0 and uO, Le.,

Clearly 1([0,1]) nCR # 0 for any 1 E f and, hence,

Since 1jJ satisfies (P S)c, it follows as in the proof of the mountain-pass theorem
that is> 0 is a critical value of ib, that is,

1jJ(v) == nin > 0 ,

\l1jJ(v) == 0

for some 0 # v E V. Therefore, as in Case 1, we conclude that u == O(v) + v
is a nonzero solution of (1.1).
D

Remark 3.1. We point out that the above proof shows more than existence
of a nonzero solution U E HJ for problem (1.1). Namely, it shows that
(i) either (1.1) has a solution U E HJ at an energy level c == <p(u) # 0 ,
(ii) or else, (1.1) has uncountably many solutions U r E HJ, r > 0, at the zero
energy level c == <p(u r ) == o.

1 Ekeland Variational Principle
In this appendix we present a beautiful result, due to 1. Ekeland, that gives
the most information one can get from a lower-semicontinuous function <p :
M ---t ffi. U { +oo} which is bounded from below on a complete metric space. It
is his celebrated variational principle [37], which has far reaching applications
in various areas of analysis and, among other things, explains the significance
of the Palais-Smale condition.

Ekeland Variational Principle. Let (M, d) be a complete metric space and
.p : M ---t ffi. U { +oo} be a lower-semicontinuous function which is bounded
from below. Suppose E > 0 and it are such that
<p ( it) ::; inf <p + E.
M

(1.1)

Then, given any A > 0, there exists u).. E M such that

(1.2)
(1.3)
and

(1.4)

Proof:

Writing d).. == ~ for simplicity, it is easy to see that

126

12 Appendix

«< v

if and only if

cp(U):S cp(v) - Ed)..(u,v)

defines a partial order on M. Then, letting U1 == U, let us define recursively a
nonincreasing sequence of subsets of M,

by setting

Sl :== {u E M I u:S U1}
S2 :== {u E M I u :S U2} where U2 E Sl satisfies cp( U2) :S inf .p + ~ ,
81

2

and so on,

Sn := {u E M IU :S un} where Un E Sn-l satisfies ep(un):S inf .p + nf_l.
8n - 1

Claim: (i) Each Sn is closed; (ii) diam (Sn) ~ 0 as n ~ 00. Indeed:
(i) If Wk ~ W E M and Wk E Sn, then Wk :S Un and

by the lower-semicontinuity of ip, hence W E S«.

(ii) If W E Sn, then W :S u., and, by the choice of Un, it follows that

and

E

cp( un) ~ cp( w) + 2n- 1 .
These two last inequalities imply that

so that limn-too diam (Sn) == O. Since M is complete, one has
00

for a unique u).. E M. Now, we claim that u).. satisfies (1.2), (1.3) and (1.4).
Indeed, (1.2) is obvious and, by uniqueness of u).., one has U i u).. for all
U =I U)... In other words, one has

127

which shows that (1.4) holds true. Finally, (1.3) follows by passing to the
limit in the inequality
d).,(u, un) <

L d).,(Uj, UHt} < L ;j .

A useful choice of A occurs when A == vIE, namely, one has the following:
Corollary A.I Let (M, d) be a complete metric space and cp : M ---+
IR U { +oo} be a lower-semicontinuous function which is bounded from below.
Suppose E > 0 and u are such that

Then, there exists fJ E M such that

cp(fJ) :s; cp(u) ,
d(fJ, u) :s; vIE ,
and

cp(fJ) < cp( u) + vIE d(fJ, u)

V u =1= fJ .

When M has a linear structure, say M is a Banach space X, and .p is
differentiable, one obtains the following consequence of Ekeland variational
principle:
Corollary A.2 Let X be a Banach space and cp : X ---+ IR be a differentiable
functional which is bounded from below. Given a minimizing sequence Un for
ip,

there exists another minimizing sequence V n such that

(1.5)

(1.6)
and

(1.7)

128

12 Appendix

*',

Proof: By applying the previous corollary with En == max{
cp(U n ) - c},
where c == inf x ip, we obtain (1.5) and (1.6) readily, as well as the inequality

Now, the choice U == V n + th with Ilhll == 1 and t > 0 yields

cp(V n + th) - cp(v n ) > -t~,
so that, dividing by t and letting t ---+ 0 one gets

for all hEX with Ilhll == 1. This clearly implies (1.7).

D

A particular situation which we used in Chapter 10 involved a C 1 _
functional on a Hilbert space E, and a closed C 1-submanifold M c E of
codimension 1 defined by a level set of another C 1-funct ional on E. Namely:

Corollary A.3 Let cp E C 1 (E, IR) (E a Hilbert space) and let M == {u E
E I ~(u) == O}1, where ~ E C 1(E, IR) with \l~(u) -I- 0 for all U E M. Assume
that cp is bounded from below on M, and let Un E M be a minimizing sequence
for cplM. Then, there exists another minimizing sequence V n E M such that
(1.8)

(1.9)

and
(1.10)
as n ---+ 00.

*',

Proof: As before, by applying Corollary A.1 with En == max{
cp(U n ) - c},
where now c == inf M cp, we readily obtain (1.8) and (1.9), as well as the
inequality
(1.11)
Now, for each V n E M and each tangent vector h E TvnM, we have a mapping
1 : (-1,1) ------7 M such that 1(0) == V n and 1'(0) == h. From (1.11) with
U == 1(t), we obtain
1 Actually, in Chapter 10, we removed an

isolated point (u == 0) from M.

1 Ekeland Variational Principle

129

cp(,(t)) - cp(v n ) > -~ 1I,(t) - vnll ,
so that, dividing by t > 0 and letting t --+ 0 one gets

Therefore, from this it follows that

and (1.10) also holds true.

D

Remark 1.1. Given v E M, we note that \7(cpIM)(v) is the projection of
\7cp(v) over the tangent space TvM, that is,

\71/J(v)
\71/J(v)
\7(ipIM)(v) = \7ip(v) - (\7ip(v), 11\7'ljJ(v) I ) 11\7'ljJ(v) II .
