Preface
These are notes for the lecture course “Differential Geometry I” given by the
second author at ETH Zürich in the fall semester 2017. They are based on
a lecture course1 given by the first author at the University of Wisconsin–
Madison in the fall semester 1983.
One can distinguish extrinsic differential geometry and intrinsic differential geometry. The former restricts attention to submanifolds of Euclidean
space while the latter studies manifolds equipped with a Riemannian metric.
The extrinsic theory is more accessible because we can visualize curves and
surfaces in R3 , but some topics can best be handled with the intrinsic theory.
The definitions in Chapter 2 have been worded in such a way that it is easy
to read them either extrinsically or intrinsically and the subsequent chapters
are mostly (but not entirely) extrinsic. One can teach a self contained one
semester course in extrinsic differential geometry by starting with Chapter 2
and skipping the sections marked with an asterisk such as §2.8.
Here is a description of the content of the book, chapter by chapter.
Chapter 1 gives a brief historical introduction to differential geometry and
explains the extrinsic versus the intrinsic viewpoint of the subject.2 This
chapter was not included in the lecture course at ETH.
The mathematical treatment of the field begins in earnest in Chapter 2,
which introduces the foundational concepts used in differential geometry
and topology. It begins by defining manifolds in the extrinsic setting as
smooth submanifolds of Euclidean space, and then moves on to tangent
spaces, submanifolds and embeddings, and vector fields and flows.3 The
chapter includes an introduction to Lie groups in the extrinsic setting and a
proof of the Closed Subgroup Theorem. It then discusses vector bundles and
submersions and proves the Theorem of Frobenius. The last two sections
deal with the intrinsic setting and can be skipped at first reading.

Extrinsic Differential Geometry
It is shown in §1.3 how any topological atlas on a set induces a topology.

Our sign convention for the Lie bracket of vector fields is explained in §2.5.7.

Chapter 3 introduces the Levi-Civita connection as covariant derivatives
of vector fields along curves.4 It continues with parallel transport, introduces
motions without sliding, twisting, and wobbling, and proves the Development Theorem. It also characterizes the Levi-Civita connection in terms of
the Christoffel symbols. The last section introduces Riemannian metrics in
the intrinsic setting, establishes their existence, and characterizes the LeviCivita connection as the unique torsion-free Riemannian connection on the
tangent bundle.
Chapter 4 defines geodesics as critical points of the energy functional and
introduces the distance function defined in terms of the lengths of curves. It
then examines the exponential map, establishes the local existence of minimal geodesics, and proves the existence of geodesically convex neighborhoods. A highlight of this chapter is the proof of the Hopf–Rinow Theorem
and of the equivalence of geodesic and metric completeness. The last section
shows how these concepts and results carry over to the intrinsic setting.
Chapter 5 introduces isometries and the Riemann curvature tensor and
proves the Generalized Theorema Egregium, which asserts that isometries
preserve geodesics, the covariant derivative, and the curvature.
Chapter 6 contains some answers to what can be viewed as the fundamental problem of differential geometry: When are two manifolds isometric?
The central tool for answering this question is the Cartan–Ambrose–Hicks
Theorem, which etablishes necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a (local) isometry between two Riemannian manifolds. The chapter
then moves on to examine flat spaces, symmetric spaces, and constant sectional curvature manifolds. It also includes a discussion of manifolds with
nonpositive sectional curvature, proofs of the Cartan–Hadamard Theorem
and of Cartan’s Fixed Point Theorem, and as the main example a discussion
of the space of positive definite symmetric matrices equipped with a natural
Riemannian metric of nonpositive sectional curvature.
This is the point at which the ETH lecture course ended. However,
Chapter 6 contains some additional material such as a proof of the Bonnet–
Myers Theorem about manifolds with positive Ricci curvature, and it ends
with brief discussions of the scalar curvature and the Weyl tensor.
The logical progression of the book up to this point is linear in that
every chapter builds on the material of the previous one, and so no chapter
can be skipped except for the first. What can be skipped at first reading
are only the sections labelled with an asterisk that carry over the various
notions introduced in the extrinsic setting to the intrinsic setting.

The covariant derivative of a global vector field is deferred to §5.2.2.

v
Chapter 7 deals with various specific topics that are at the heart of the
subject but go beyond the scope of a one semester lecture course. It begins
with a section on conjugate points and the Morse Index Theorem, which
follows on naturally from Chapter 4 about geodesics. These results in turn
are used in the proof of continuity of the injectivity radius in the second
section. The third section builds on Chapter 5 on isometries and the Riemann curvature tensor. It contains a proof of the Myers–Steenrod Theorem,
which asserts that the group of isometries is always a finite-dimensional Lie
group. The fourth section examines the special case of the isometry group of
a compact Lie group equipped with a bi-invariant Riemannian metric. The
last two sections are devoted to Donaldson’s differential geometric approach
to Lie algebra theory as explained in [17]. They build on all the previous
chapters and especially on the material in Chapter 6 about manifolds with
nonpositive sectional curvature. The fifth section establishes conditions under which a convex function on a Hadamard manifold has a critical point.
The last section uses these results to show that the Killing form on a simple
Lie algebra is nondegenerate, to establish uniqueness up to conjugation of
maximal compact subgroups of the automorphism group of a semisimple Lie
algebra, and to prove Cartan’s theorem about the compact real form of a
semisimple complex Lie algebra.
The appendix contains brief discussions of some fundamental notions of
analysis such as maps and functions, normal forms, and Euclidean spaces,
that play a central role throughout this book.
We thank everyone who pointed out errors or typos in earlier versions of
this book. In particular, we thank Charel Antony and Samuel Trautwein for
many helpful comments. We also thank Daniel Grieser for his constructive
suggestions concerning the exposition.

Chapter 1

What is Differential
Geometry?
This preparatory chapter contains a brief historical introduction to the subject of differential geometry (§1.1), explains the concept of a coordinate
chart (§1.2), discusses topological manifolds and shows how an atlas on a
set determines a topology (§1.3), introduces the notion of a smooth structure
(§1.4), and outlines the master plan for this book (§1.5).

1.1

Cartography and Differential Geometry

Carl Friedrich Gauß (1777-1855) is the father of differential geometry. He
was (among many other things) a cartographer and many terms in modern
differential geometry (chart, atlas, map, coordinate system, geodesic, etc.)
reflect these origins. He was led to his Theorema Egregium (see 5.3.1) by
the question of whether it is possible to draw an accurate map of a portion
of our planet. Let us begin by discussing a mathematical formulation of this
problem.
Consider the two-dimensional sphere S 2 sitting in the three-dimensional
Euclidean space R3 . It is cut out by the equation
x2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1.
A map of a small region U ⊂ S 2 is represented mathematically by a one-toone correspondence with a small region in the plane z = 0. In this book we
will represent this with the notation ϕ : U → ϕ(U ) ⊂ R2 and call such an
object a chart or a system of local coordinates (see Figure 1.1).

φ

Figure 1.1: A chart.
What does it mean that ϕ is an “accurate” map? Ideally the user would
want to use the map to compute the length of a curve in S 2 . The length of
a curve γ connecting two points p, q ∈ S 2 is given by the formula
Z 1
|γ̇(t)| dt,
γ(0) = p, γ(1) = q,
L(γ) =
0

so the user will want the chart ϕ to satisfy L(γ) = L(ϕ ◦ γ) for all curves γ.
It is a consequence of the Theorema Egregium that there is no such chart.
Perhaps the user of such a map will be content to use the map to plot
the shortest path between two points p and q in U . This path is called a
geodesic and is denoted by γpq . It satisfies L(γpq ) = dU (p, q), where
dU (p, q) = inf{L(γ) | γ(t) ∈ U, γ(0) = p, γ(1) = q}
so our less demanding user will be content if the chart ϕ satisfies
dU (p, q) = dE (ϕ(p), ϕ(q)),
where dE (ϕ(p), ϕ(q)) is the length of the shortest path in the plane. It is
also a consequence of the Theorema Egregium that there is no such chart.
Now suppose our user is content to have a map which makes it easy to
navigate close to the shortest path connecting two points. Ideally the user
would use a straight edge, magnetic compass, and protractor to do this.
S/he would draw a straight line on the map connecting p and q and steer a
course which maintains a constant angle (on the map) between the course
and meridians. This can be done by the method of stereographic projection.
This chart is conformal (which means that it preserves angles). According
to Wikipedia stereographic projection was known to the ancient Greeks
and a map using stereographic projection was constructed in the early 16th
century. Exercises 3.7.5, 3.7.12, and 6.4.22 use stereographic projection; the
latter exercise deals with the Poincaré model of the hyperbolic plane. The
hyperbolic plane provides a counterexample to Euclid’s Parallel Postulate.

Exercise 1.1.1. It is more or less obvious that for any surface M ⊂ R3
there is a unique shortest path in M connecting two points if they are
sufficiently close. (This will be proved in Theorem 4.5.3.) This shortest
path is called the minimal geodesic connecting p and q. Use this fact to
prove that the minimal geodesic joining two points p and q in S 2 is an arc
of the great circle through p and q. (This is the intersection of the sphere
with the plane through p, q, and the center of the sphere.) Also prove that
the minimal geodesic connecting two points in a plane is the straight line
segment connecting them. Hint: Both a great circle in a sphere and a line
in a plane are preserved by a reflection. (See also Exercise 4.2.5 below.)
Exercise 1.1.2. Stereographic projection is defined by the condition that
for p ∈ S 2 \ n the point ϕ(p) lies in the xy-plane z = 0 and the three
points n = (0, 0, 1), p, and ϕ(p) are collinear (see Figure 1.2). Using the
formula that the cosine of the angle between two unit vectors is their inner
product prove that ϕ is conformal. Hint: The plane through p, q, and n
intersects the xy-plane in a straight line and the sphere in a circle through
n. The plane through n, p, ϕ(p), and the center of the sphere intersects the
sphere in a meridian. A proof that stereographic projection is conformal
can be found in [27, page 248]. The proof is elementary in the sense that
it doesn’t use calculus. An elementary proof can also be found online at
http://people.reed.edu/jerry/311/stereo.pdf.
Exercise 1.1.3. It may seem fairly obvious that you can’t draw an accurate
map of a portion of the earth because the sphere is curved. However, the
cylinder
C = {(x, y, z) ∈ R3 | x2 + y 2 = 1}
is also curved, but the map ψ : R2 → C defined by ψ(s, t) = (cos(t), sin(t), s)
preserves lengths of curves, i.e. L(ψ ◦ γ) = L(γ) for any curve γ : [a, b] → R2 .
Prove this.

1.1.4. Standard Notations. The standard notations N, N0 , Z, Q, R,
C denote respectively the natural numbers (= positive integers), the nonnegative integers, the integers, the rational numbers, the real numbers, and
the complex numbers. We denote the identity map of a set X by idX and the
n×n identity matrix by 1ln or simply 1l. The notation V ∗ is used for the dual
of a vector space V , but when K is a field such as R or C the notation K∗
is sometimes used for the multiplicative group K \ {0}. The terms smooth,
infinitely differentiable, and C ∞ are all synonymous.

1.2

Coordinates

The rest of this chapter defines the category of smooth manifolds and smooth
maps between them. Before giving the precise definitions we will introduce
some terminology and give some examples.
Definition 1.2.1. A chart on a set M is a pair (ϕ, U ) where U is a subset
of M and ϕ : U → ϕ(U ) is a bijection from U to an open set ϕ(U ) in Rm .
An atlas on M is a collection
A = {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A
of charts such that the domains Uα cover M , i.e. M =

S

α∈A Uα .

The idea is that if ϕ(p) = (x1 (p), . . . , xm (p)) for p ∈ U , then the functions xi form a system of local coordinates defined on the subset U of M .
The dimension of M should be m since it takes m numbers to uniquely specify a point of U . We will soon impose conditions on charts (ϕ, U ), however
for the moment we are assuming nothing about the maps ϕ (other than that
they are bijective).
Example 1.2.2. Every open subset U ⊂ Rm has an atlas consisting of a
single chart, namely (ϕ, U ) = (idU , U ) where idU denotes the identity map
of U .
Example 1.2.3. Assume that Ω ⊂ Rm is an open set, that M is a subset
of the product Rm × Rn = Rm+n , and that h : Ω → Rn is a continuous map
whose graph is M , i.e.
graph(h) := {(x, y) ∈ Ω × Rn | y = h(x)} = M.
Let U = graph(h) = M and let ϕ(x, y) = x be the projection of U onto Ω.
Then the pair (ϕ, U ) is a chart on M . The inverse map is given by
ϕ−1 (x) = (x, h(x))
for x ∈ Ω = ϕ(U ). Thus M has again an atlas consisting of a single chart.

Example 1.2.4. The m-sphere

S m = p = (x0 , . . . , xm ) ∈ Rm+1 | x20 + · · · + x2m = 1
has an atlas consisting of the 2m + 2 charts ϕi± : Ui± → Dm where Dm is the
open unit disk in Rm , Ui± = {p ∈ S m | ± xi > 0}, and ϕi± is the projection
which discards the ith coordinate. (See Example 2.1.14 below.)
Example 1.2.5. Let
A = AT ∈ R(m+1)×(m+1)
be a symmetric matrix and define a quadratic form F : Rm+1 → R by
F (p) := pT Ap,

p = (x0 , . . . , xm ).

After a linear change of coordinates the function F has the form
F (p) = x20 + · · · + x2k − x2k+1 − · · · − x2r .
(Here r + 1 is the rank of the matrix A.) The set M = F −1 (1) has an atlas
of 2m + 2 charts by the same construction as in Example 1.2.4, in fact S m
is the special case where A = 1lm+1 , the (m + 1) × (m + 1) identity matrix.
(See Example 2.1.13 below for another way to construct charts.)
Figure 1.3 enumerates the familiar quadric surfaces in R3 . The paraboloids are examples of graphs as in Example 1.2.3 with Ω = R2 and n = 1,
and the ellipsoid and the two hyperboloids are instances of the quadric hypersurfaces defined in Example 1.2.5. The sphere is an instance of the ellipsoid
(with a = b = c = 1) and the cylinder is a limit of the ellipsoid as well as of
the elliptic hyperboloid of one sheet (as a = b = 1 and c → ∞). The pictures
were generated by computer using the parameterizations
x = a cos(t) cos(s),

y = b sin(t) cos(s),

z = c sin(s)

y = b sin(t) cosh(s),

z = c sinh(s),

for the ellipsoid,
x = a cos(t) cosh(s),

for the elliptic hyperboloid of one sheet, and
x = a cos(t) sinh(s),

y = b sin(t) sinh(s),

z = ±c cosh(s)

for the elliptic hyperboloid of two sheets. These quadric surfaces will be
often used in the sequel to illustrate important concepts.

In the following two examples K denotes either the field R of real numbers
or the field C of complex numbers, K∗ := {λ ∈ K | λ ̸= 0} denotes the
corresponding multiplicative group, and V denotes a vector space over K.
Example 1.2.6. The projective space of V is the set of lines (through
the origin) in V . In other words,
P (V ) = {ℓ ⊂ V | ℓ is a 1-dimensional K-linear subspace}
When K = R and V = Rm+1 this is denoted by RPm and when K = C
and V = Cm+1 this is denoted by CPm . For our purposes we can identify the
spaces Cm+1 and R2m+2 but the projective spaces CPm and RP2m are very
different. The various lines ℓ ∈ P (V ) intersect in the origin, however, after
the identification P (V ) = {[v] | v ∈ V \ {0}} with [v] := K∗ v = Kv \ {0} the
elements of P (V ) become disjoint, i.e. P (V ) is the set of equivalence classes
of an equivalence relation on the open set V \ {0}. Assume that V = Km+1
and define an atlas on P (V ) as follows. For each integer i = 0, 1, . . . , m
define Ui := {[v] | v = (x0 , . . . , xm ), xi ̸= 0} and define ϕi : Ui → Km by

Example 1.2.7. For each positive integer k the set
Gk (V ) := {ℓ ⊂ V | ℓ is a k-dimensional K-linear subspace}
is called the Grassmann manifold of k-planes in V . Thus G1 (V ) = P (V ).
Assume that V = Kn and define an atlas on Gk (V ) as follows. Let e1 , . . . , en
be the standard basis for Kn , i.e. ei is the ith column of the n × n identity
matrix 1ln . Each partition {1, 2, . . . , n} = I ∪ J, I = {i1 < · · · < ik },
J = {j1 < · · · < jn−k } of the first n natural numbers determines a direct
sum decomposition Kn = V = VI ⊕ VJ via the formulas
VI = Kei1 + · · · + Keik ,

VJ = Kej1 + · · · + Kejn−k .

Let UI denote the set of all k-planes ℓ ∈ Gk (V ) which are transverse to VJ ,
i.e. such that ℓ ∩ VJ = {0}. The elements of UI are precisely those k-planes
of the form ℓ = graph(A), where A : VI → VJ is a linear map. Define the

CHAPTER 1. WHAT IS DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY?

Topological Manifolds*

Definition 1.3.1. A topological manifold is a topological space M such
that each point p ∈ M has an open neighborhood U which is homeomorphic
to an open subset of a Euclidean space.
Brouwer’s Invariance of Domain Theorem asserts that, when U ⊂ Rm
and V ⊂ Rn are nonempty open sets and ϕ : U → V is a homeomorphism,
then m = n. This means that if M is a connected topological manifold
and some point of M has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset
of Rm , then every point of M has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open
subset of that same Rm . In this case we say that M has dimension m or
is m-dimensional or is an m-manifold. Brouwer’s theorem is fairly difficult
(see [24, p. 126] for example) but if ϕ is a diffeomorphism, then the result is
an easy consequence of the invariance of the rank in linear algebra and the
chain rule. (See equation (1.4.1) below.)
By definition, a topological m-manifold M admits an atlas where every
chart (ϕ, U ) of the atlas is a homeomorphism ϕ : U → ϕ(U ) from an open
set U ⊂ M to an open set ϕ(U ) ⊂ Rm . The following definition and lemma
explain when a given atlas determines a topology on M .
Definition 1.3.2. Let M be a set. Two charts (ϕ1 , U1 ) and (ϕ2 , U2 ) on M
are said to be topologically compatible iff ϕ1 (U1 ∩ U2 ) and ϕ2 (U1 ∩ U2 )
are open subsets of Rm and the transition map
ϕ21 := ϕ2 ◦ ϕ−1
1 : ϕ1 (U1 ∩ U2 ) → ϕ2 (U1 ∩ U2 )
is a homeomorphism. An atlas is said to be a topological atlas iff any two
charts in this atlas are topologically compatible.
Lemma 1.3.3. Let A = {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A be an atlas on a set M .
(i) If A is a topological atlas, then the collection


ϕα (U ∩ Uα ) is an open subset of Rm
U := U ⊂ M
for every α ∈ A

(1.3.1)

is a topology on M , and with this topology each Uα is an open subset of M
and each ϕα is a homeomorphism. Thus M is a topological manifold with
the topology (1.3.1).
(ii) If M is a topological manifold and each Uα is an open set and each ϕα
is a homeomorphism, then A is a topological atlas and the topology (1.3.1)
coincides with the topology of M .
Proof. Exercise.

1.3. TOPOLOGICAL MANIFOLDS*

If M is a topological manifold, then the collection of all charts (U, ϕ)
on M such that U is open and ϕ is a homeomorphism is a topological atlas.
It is the unique maximal topological atlas in the sense that it contains
every other topological atlas as in part (ii) of Lemma 1.3.3. However, we will
often consider smaller, even finite, topological atlases, and by Lemma 1.3.3
each of these determines the topology of M .
Exercise 1.3.4. Show that the atlas in each example in §1.2 is a topological
atlas. Conclude that each of these examples is a topological manifold.
Any subset S ⊂ X of a topological space X inherits a topology from X,
called the relative topology of S. A subset U0 ⊂ S is called relatively
open in S (or S-open) iff there is an open set U ⊂ X such that U0 = U ∩ S.
A subset A0 ⊂ S is called relatively closed (or S-closed) iff there is a
closed set A ⊂ X such that A0 = A ∩ S. The relative topology on S is the
coarsest topology such that the inclusion map S → X is continuous.
Exercise 1.3.5. Show that the relative topology satisfies the axioms of a
topology (i.e. arbitrary unions and finite intersections of S-open sets are Sopen, and the empty set and S itself are S-open). Show that the complement
of an S-open set in S is S-closed and vice versa.
Exercise 1.3.6. Each of the sets defined in Examples 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.4,
and 1.2.5 is a subset of some Euclidean space Rk . Show that the topology
in Exercise 1.3.4 is the relative topology inherited from the topology of Rk .
The topology on Rk is of course the metric topology defined by the distance
function d(x, y) = |x − y|.
If ∼ is an equivalence relation on a topological space X, then the quotient space Y := X/∼ := {[x] | x ∈ X} is the set of all equivalence classes
[x] := {x′ ∈ X | x′ ∼ x}. The map π : X → Y defined by π(x) = [x] will
be called the obvious projection. The quotient space inherits the quotient topology from Y . Namely, a set V ⊂ Y is open in this topology
iff the preimage π −1 (V ) is open in X. This topology is the finest topology on Y such that projection π : X → Y is continuous. Since the operation V 7→ π −1 (V ) commutes with arbitrary unions and intersections the
quotient topology obviously satisfies the axioms of a topology.
Exercise 1.3.7. Show that the topology on the projective space P (V ) in
Example 1.2.6 determined by the atlas is the quotient topology inherited
from the open set V \ {0}. Express the Grassmann manifold Gk (V ) in
Example 1.2.7 as a quotient space and show that the topology determined
by the atlas is the quotient topology. (Recall that in both examples V = Kn
with K = R or K = C.)

CHAPTER 1. WHAT IS DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY?

Smooth Manifolds Defined*

Let U ⊂ Rn and V ⊂ Rm be open sets. A map f : U → V is called smooth
iff it is infinitely differentiable, i.e. iff all its partial derivatives
∂αf =

∂ α1 +···+αn f
,
∂xα1 1 · · · ∂xαnn

α = (α1 , . . . , αn ) ∈ Nn0 ,

exist and are continuous. In later chapters we will sometimes write C ∞ (U, V )
for the set of smooth maps from U to V .
Definition 1.4.1. Let U ⊂ Rn and V ⊂ Rm be open sets. For a smooth
map f = (f1 , . . . , fm ) : U → V and a point x ∈ U the derivative of f at x
is the linear map df (x) : Rn → Rm defined by
df (x)ξ :=

d
f (x + tξ) − f (x)
f (x + tξ) = lim
,
t→0
dt t=0
t

ξ ∈ Rn .

This linear map is represented by the Jacobian matrix of f at x which
will also be denoted by


∂f1
∂f1
(x) · · ·
(x)
 ∂x1

df (x) := 

 ∂fm

m
(x)
(x) · · · ∂f
∂xn
∂x1
Note that we use the same notation for the Jacobian matrix and the corresponding linear map from Rn to Rm .
The derivative satisfies the chain rule. Namely, if U ⊂ Rn , V ⊂ Rm ,
and W ⊂ Rℓ are open sets and f : U → V and g : V → W are smooth map,
then g ◦ f : U → W is smooth and
d(g ◦ f )(x) = dg(f (x)) ◦ df (x) : Rn → Rℓ

(1.4.1)

for every x ∈ U . Moreover the identity map idU : U → U is always smooth
and its derivative at every point is the identity map of Rn . This implies that,
if f : U → V is a diffeomorphism (i.e. f is bijective and f and f −1 are both
smooth), then its derivative at every point is an invertible linear map. This
is why the Invariance of Domain Theorem (discussed after Definition 1.3.1)
is easy for diffeomorphisms: if f : U → V is a diffeomorphism, then the
Jacobian matrix df (x) ∈ Rm×n is invertible for every x ∈ U and so m = n.
The Inverse Function Theorem (see Theorem A.2.2 in Appendix A.2) is a
kind of converse.

1.4. SMOOTH MANIFOLDS DEFINED*

11

Definition 1.4.2 (Smooth manifold). Let M be a set. A chart on M
is a pair (ϕ, U ) where U ⊂ M and ϕ is a bijection from U to an open subset ϕ(U ) ⊂ Rm of some Euclidean space. Two charts (ϕ1 , U1 ) and (ϕ2 , U2 )
are said to be smoothly compatible iff ϕ1 (U1 ∩ U2 ) and ϕ2 (U1 ∩ U2 ) are
both open in Rm and the transition map
ϕ21 = ϕ2 ◦ ϕ−1
1 : ϕ1 (U1 ∩ U2 ) → ϕ2 (U1 ∩ U2 )

(1.4.2)

is a diffeomorphism. A smooth atlas on M is a collection A of charts
on M any two of which are smoothly compatible and such that the sets U ,
as (ϕ, U ) ranges over the elements of A , cover M (i.e. for every p ∈ M
there is a chart (ϕ, U ) ∈ A with p ∈ U ). A maximal smooth atlas is an
atlas which contains every chart which is smoothly compatible with each of
its members. A smooth manifold is a pair consisting of a set M and a
maximal smooth atlas A on M .
Lemma 1.4.3. If A is a smooth atlas, then so is the collection A of all
charts smoothly compatible with each member of A . The smooth atlas A is
obviously maximal. In other words, every smooth atlas extends uniquely to
a maximal smooth atlas.
Proof. Let (ϕ1 , U1 ) and (ϕ2 , U2 ) be charts in A and let x ∈ ϕ1 (U1 ∩ U2 ).
Choose a chart (ϕ, U ) ∈ A such that ϕ−1
1 (x) ∈ U . Then ϕ1 (U ∩ U1 ∩ U2 ) is
an open neighborhood of x in Rm and the transition maps
ϕ ◦ ϕ−1
1 : ϕ1 (U ∩ U1 ∩ U2 ) → ϕ(U ∩ U1 ∩ U2 ),
ϕ2 ◦ ϕ−1 : ϕ(U ∩ U1 ∩ U2 ) → ϕ2 (U ∩ U1 ∩ U2 )
are smooth by definition of A . Hence so is their composition. This shows
that the map ϕ2 ◦ ϕ−1
1 : ϕ1 (U1 ∩ U2 ) → ϕ2 (U1 ∩ U2 ) is smooth near x. Since x
was chosen arbitrary, this map is smooth. Apply the same argument to its
inverse to deduce that it is a diffeomorphism. Thus A is a smooth atlas.
Definitions 1.4.2 and 1.3.2 are mutatis mutandis the same, so every
smooth atlas on a set M is a fortiori a topological atlas, i.e. every smooth
manifold is a topological manifold. (See Lemma 1.3.3.) Moreover the definitions are worded in such a way that it is obvious that every smooth map
is continuous.
Exercise 1.4.4. Show that each of the atlases from the examples in §1.2 is a
smooth atlas. (You must show that the transition maps from Exercise 1.3.4
are smooth.)

12

CHAPTER 1. WHAT IS DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY?

When A is a smooth atlas on a topological manifold M one says that A
is a smooth structure on the (topological) manifold M iff A ⊂ B,
where B is the maximal topological atlas on M . When no confusion can
result we generally drop the notation for the maximal smooth atlas as in the
following exercise.
Exercise 1.4.5. Define the notion of a continuous map between topological
manifolds and of a smooth map between smooth manifolds via continuity,
respectively smoothness, in local coordinates. Let M , N , and P be smooth
manifolds and f : M → N and g : N → P be smooth maps. Prove that
the identity map idM is smooth and that the composition g ◦ f : M → P
is a smooth map. (This is of course an easy consequence of the chain
rule (1.4.1).)
Remark 1.4.6. It is easy to see that a topological manifold can have
many distinct smooth structures. For example, {(idR , R)} and {(ϕ, R)}
where ϕ(x) = x3 are atlases on the real numbers which extend to distinct
smooth structures but determine the same topology. However these two
manifolds are diffeomorphic via the map x 7→ x1/3 . In the 1950’s it was
proved that there are smooth manifolds which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic and that there are topological manifolds which admit no smooth
structure. In the 1980’s it was proved in dimension m = 4 that there are
uncountably many smooth manifolds that are all homeomorphic to R4 but
no two of them are diffeomorphic to each other. These theorems are very
surprising and very deep.
A collection of sets and maps between them is called a category iff the
collection of maps contains the identity map of every set in the collection and
the composition of any two maps in the collection is also in the collection.
The sets are called the objects of the category and the maps are called the
morphisms of the category. An invertible morphism whose inverse is also in
the category is called an isomorphism. Some examples are the category of
all sets and maps, the category of topological spaces and continuous maps
(the isomorphisms are the homeomorphisms), the category of topological
manifolds and continuous maps between them, and the category of smooth
manifolds and smooth maps (the isomorphisms are the diffeomorphisms).
Each of the last three categories is a subcategory of the preceding one.
Often categories are enlarged by a kind of “gluing process”. For example,
the “global” category of smooth manifolds and smooth maps was constructed
from the “local” category of open sets in Euclidean space and smooth maps
between them via the device of charts and atlases. (The chain rule shows

1.5. THE MASTER PLAN

13

that this local category is in fact a category.) The point of Definition 1.3.2
is to show (via Lemma 1.3.3) that topological manifolds can be defined
in a manner analogous to the definition we gave for smooth manifolds in
Definition 1.4.2.
Other kinds of manifolds (and hence other kinds of geometry) are defined by choosing other local categories, i.e. by imposing conditions on the
transition maps in Equation (1.4.2). For example, a real analytic manifold
is one where the transition maps are real analytic, a complex manifold is one
whose coordinate charts take values in Cn and whose transition maps are
holomorphic diffeomorphisms, and a symplectic manifold is one whose coordinate charts take values in R2n and whose transition maps are canonical
transformations in the sense of classical mechanics. Thus CPn is a complex
manifold and RPn is a real analytic manifold.

1.5

The Master Plan

In studying differential geometry it is best to begin with extrinsic differential
geometry which is the study of the geometry of submanifolds of Euclidean
space as in Examples 1.2.3 and 1.2.5. This is because we can visualize
curves and surfaces in R3 . However, there are a few topics in the later
chapters which require the more abstract Definition 1.4.2 even to say interesting things about extrinsic geometry. There is a generalization to these
manifolds involving a structure called a Riemannian metric. We will call
this generalization intrinsic differential geometry. Examples 1.2.6 and 1.2.7
fit into this more general definition so intrinsic differential geometry can be
used to study them.
Since an open set in Euclidean space is a smooth manifold the definition
of a submanifold of Euclidean space (see §2.1 below) is mutatis mutandis
the same as the definition of a submanifold of a manifold. The definitions
in Chapter 2 are worded in such a way that it is easy to read them either
extrinsically or intrinsically and the subsequent chapters are mostly (but not
entirely) extrinsic. Those sections which require intrinsic differential geometry (or which translate extrinsic concepts into intrinsic ones) are marked
with a *.

14

CHAPTER 1. WHAT IS DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY?

Chapter 2

Foundations
This chapter introduces various fundamental concepts that are central to
the fields of differential geometry and differential topology. Both fields concern the study of smooth manifolds and their diffeomorphisms. The chapter
begins with an introduction to submanifolds of Euclidean space and smooth
maps (§2.1), to tangent spaces and derivatives (§2.2), and to submanifolds
and embeddings (§2.3). In §2.4 we move on to vector fields and flows and
introduce the Lie bracket of two vector fields. Lie groups and their Lie algebras, in the extrinsic setting, are the subject of §2.5, which includes a proof
of the Closed Subgroup Theorem. In §2.6 we introduce vector bundles over
a manifold as subbundles of a trivial bundle and in §2.7 we prove the theorem of Frobenius. The last two sections of this chapter are concerned with
carrying over all these concepts from the extrinsic to the intrinsic setting
and can be skipped at first reading (§2.8 and §2.9).

2.1

Submanifolds of Euclidean Space

To carry out the Master Plan §1.5 we must (as was done in [50]) extend
the definition of smooth map to maps f : X → Y between subsets X ⊂ Rk
and Y ⊂ Rℓ which are not necessarily open. In this case a map f : X → Y is
called smooth iff for each x0 ∈ X there exists an open neighborhood U ⊂ Rk
of x0 and a smooth map F : U → Rℓ that agrees with f on U ∩ X. A
map f : X → Y is called a diffeomorphism iff f is bijective and f and f −1
are smooth. When there exists a diffeomorphism f : X → Y then X and Y
are called diffeomorphic. When X and Y are open these definitions coincide with the usage in §1.4.

16

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Exercise 2.1.1 (Chain rule). Let X ⊂ Rk , Y ⊂ Rℓ , Z ⊂ Rm be arbitrary
subsets. If f : X → Y and g : Y → Z are smooth maps, then so is the
composition g ◦ f : X → Z. The identity map id : X → X is smooth.
Exercise 2.1.2. Let E ⊂ Rk be an m-dimensional linear subspace and
let v1 , . .P
. , vm be a basis of E. Then the map f : Rm → E defined by
f (x) := m
i=1 xi vi is a diffeomorphism.
Definition 2.1.3. Let k, m ∈ N0 . A subset M ⊂ Rk is called a smooth
m-dimensional submanifold of Rk iff every point p ∈ M has an open
neighborhood U ⊂ Rk such that U ∩ M is diffeomorphic to an open subset Ω ⊂ Rm . A diffeomorphism
ϕ:U ∩M →Ω
is called a coordinate chart of M and its inverse
ψ := ϕ−1 : Ω → U ∩ M
is called a (smooth) parametrization of U ∩ M (see Figure 2.1).

In Definition 2.1.3 we have used the fact that the domain of a smooth
map can be an arbitrary subset of Euclidean space and need not be open.
The term m-manifold in Rk is short for m-dimensional submanifold of Rk .
In keeping with the Master Plan §1.5 we will sometimes say manifold rather
than submanifold of Rk to indicate that the context holds in both the intrinsic and extrinsic settings.
Lemma 2.1.4. If M ⊂ Rk is a nonempty smooth m-manifold, then m ≤ k.
Proof. Fix an element p0 ∈ M , choose a coordinate chart ϕ : U ∩ M → Ω
with p0 ∈ U and values in an open subset Ω ⊂ Rm , and denote its inverse by ψ := ϕ−1 : Ω → U ∩ M . Shrinking U , if necessary, we may assume that ϕ extends to a smooth map Φ : U → Rm . This extension satisfies Φ(ψ(x)) = ϕ(ψ(x)) = x and hence dΦ(ψ(x))dψ(x) = id : Rm → Rm for
all x ∈ Ω, by the chain rule. Hence the derivative dψ(x) : Rm → Rk is injective for all x ∈ Ω, and hence m ≤ k because Ω is nonempty. This proves
Lemma 2.1.4.

2.1. SUBMANIFOLDS OF EUCLIDEAN SPACE

Example 2.1.5. Consider the 2-sphere

M := S 2 = (x, y, z) ∈ R3 | x2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1
depicted in Figure 2.2 and let U ⊂ R3 and Ω ⊂ R2 be the open sets


U := (x, y, z) ∈ R3 | z > 0 ,
Ω := (x, y) ∈ R2 | x2 + y 2 < 1 .
The map ϕ : U ∩ M → Ω given by
ϕ(x, y, z) := (x, y)
is bijective and its inverse ψ := ϕ−1 : Ω → U ∩ M is given by
p
ψ(x, y) = (x, y, 1 − x2 − y 2 ).
Since both ϕ and ψ are smooth, the map ϕ is a coordinate chart on S 2 .
Similarly, we can use the open sets z < 0, y > 0, y < 0, x > 0, x < 0 to cover
S 2 by six coordinate charts. Hence S 2 is a manifold. A similar argument
shows that the unit sphere S m ⊂ Rm+1 (see Example 2.1.14 below) is a
manifold for every integer m ≥ 0.

Figure 2.2: The 2-sphere and the 2-torus.
Example 2.1.6. Let Ω ⊂ Rm be an open set and h : Ω → Rk−m be a smooth
map. Then the graph of h is a smooth submanifold of Rm × Rk−m = Rk :
M := graph(h) := {(x, y) | x ∈ Ω, y = h(x)} .
It can be covered by a single coordinate chart ϕ : U ∩ M → Ω, where
U := Ω × Rk−m , ϕ is the projection onto Ω, and ψ := ϕ−1 : Ω → U is given
by ψ(x) = (x, h(x)) for x ∈ Ω.
Exercise 2.1.7 (The case m = 0). Show that a subset M ⊂ Rk is a 0dimensional submanifold if and only if M is discrete, i.e. for every p ∈ M
there exists an open set U ⊂ Rk such that U ∩ M = {p}.

show that M1 × M2 is an (m1 + m2 )-dimensional submanifold of Rk1 +k2 .
Prove that the m-torus Tm := (S 1 )m is a smooth submanifold of Cm .
The next theorem characterizes smooth submanifolds of Euclidean space.
In particular condition (iii) will be useful in many cases for verifying the
manifold condition. We emphasize that the sets U0 := U ∩ M that appear
in Definition 2.1.3 are open subsets of M with respect to the relative topology
that M inherits from the ambient space Rk and that such relatively open
sets are also called M -open (see §1.3).
Theorem 2.1.10 (Manifolds). Let m and k be integers with 0 ≤ m ≤ k.
Let M ⊂ Rk be a set and p0 ∈ M . Then the following are equivalent.
(i) There exists an M -open neighborhood U0 ⊂ M of p0 and a diffeomorphism ϕ0 : U0 → Ω0 onto an open set Ω0 ⊂ Rm .
(ii) There exist open sets U, Ω ⊂ Rk and a diffeomorphism ϕ : U → Ω such
that p0 ∈ U and
ϕ(U ∩ M ) = Ω ∩ (Rm × {0})
(see Figure 2.3).
(iii) There exists an open set U ⊂ Rk and a smooth map f : U → Rk−m
such that p0 ∈ U , the derivative df (p) : Rk → Rk−m is surjective for every
point p ∈ U ∩ M , and
U ∩ M = f −1 (0) = {p ∈ U | f (p) = 0} .
Moreover, if (i) holds, then the diffeomorphism ϕ : U → Ω in (ii) can be
chosen such that U ∩ M ⊂ U0 and ϕ(p) = (ϕ0 (p), 0) for every p ∈ U ∩ M .

Proof. First assume (ii) and denote the diffeomorphism in (ii) by
ϕ = (ϕ1 , ϕ2 , . . . , ϕk ) : U → Ω ⊂ Rk .
Then part (i) holds with U0 := U ∩ M , Ω0 := {x ∈ Rm | (x, 0) ∈ Ω}, and
ϕ0 := (ϕ1 , . . . , ϕm )|U0 : U0 → Ω0 ,
and part (iii) holds with f := (ϕm+1 , . . . , ϕk ) : U → Rk−m . This shows that
part (ii) implies both (i) and (iii).
We prove that (i) implies (ii). Let ϕ0 : U0 → Ω0 be the coordinate chart
in part (i), let ψ0 := ϕ−1
0 : Ω0 → U0 be its inverse, and let x0 := ϕ0 (p0 ) ∈ Ω0 .
Then the derivative dψ0 (x0 ) : Rm → Rk is injective by Lemma 2.1.4. Hence
there exists a matrix B ∈ Rk×(k−m) such that det([dψ0 (x0 ) B]) ̸= 0. Define
the map ψ : Ω0 × Rk−m → Rk by
ψ(x, y) := ψ0 (x) + By.
Then the k × k-matrix dψ(x0 , 0) = [dψ0 (x0 ) B] ∈ Rk×k is nonsingular, by
choice of B. Hence, by the Inverse Function Theorem A.2.2, there exists an
e ⊂ Ω0 × Rk−m of (x0 , 0) such that U
e := ψ(Ω)
e ⊂ Rk is
open neighborhood Ω
e →U
e is a diffeomorphism. In particular, the restriction of ψ
open and ψ|Ωe : Ω
e is open and contains x0 .
e
to Ω is injective. Now the set {x ∈ Ω0 | (x, 0) ∈ Ω}
Hence the set

o n
o
e0 := ψ0 (x) x ∈ Ω0 , (x, 0) ∈ Ω
e = p ∈ U0 (ϕ0 (p), 0) ∈ Ω
e ⊂M
U
is M -open and contains p0 . Hence, by the definition of the relative topology,
e0 = W ∩ M . Define
there exists an open set W ⊂ Rk such that U
e ∩ W,
e ∩ ψ −1 (W ).
U := U
Ω := Ω
e0 and ψ restricts to a diffeomorphism from Ω to U .
Then U ∩ M = U
Now let (x, y) ∈ Ω. We claim that
ψ(x, y) ∈ M

⇐⇒

y = 0.

(2.1.1)

If y = 0, then obviously ψ(x, y) = ψ0 (x) ∈ M . Conversely, let (x, y) ∈ Ω and
e ∩W ∩M =U
e0 ⊂ U0
suppose that p := ψ(x, y) ∈ M . Then p ∈ U ∩ M = U
e
e
and hence (ϕ0 (p), 0) ∈ Ω, by definition of U0 . This implies
ψ(ϕ0 (p), 0) = ψ0 (ϕ0 (p)) = p = ψ(x, y).
e and the reSince the pairs (x, y) and (ϕ0 (p), 0) both belong to the set Ω
e
striction of ψ to Ω is injective we obtain x = ϕ0 (p) and y = 0. This
proves (2.1.1). It follows from (2.1.1) that the map ϕ := (ψ|Ω )−1 : U → Ω
satisfies ϕ(U ∩ M ) = {(x, y) ∈ Ω | ψ(x, y) ∈ M } = Ω ∩ (Rm × {0}). Thus we
have proved that (i) implies (ii).

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

We prove that (iii) implies (ii). Let f : U → Rk−m be as in part (iii).
Then p0 ∈ U and the derivative df (p0 ) : Rk → Rk−m is a surjective linear
map. Hence there exists a matrix A ∈ Rm×k such that



det
̸= 0.
df (p0 )
Define the map ϕ : U → Rk by


Ap
ϕ(p) :=
f (p)

for p ∈ U.

Then det(dϕ(p0 )) ̸= 0. Hence, by the Inverse Function Theorem A.2.2, there
exists an open neighborhood U ′ ⊂ U of p0 such that Ω′ := ϕ(U ′ ) is an open
subset of Rk and the restriction ϕ′ := ϕ|U ′ : U ′ → Ω′ is a diffeomorphism.
In particular, the restriction ϕ|U ′ is injective. Moreover, it follows from the
assumptions on f and the definition of ϕ that


U ′ ∩ M = p ∈ U ′ f (p) = 0 = p ∈ U ′ ϕ(p) ∈ Rm × {0}

and so ϕ′ (U ′ ∩M ) = Ω′ ∩ Rm ×{0} . Hence the diffeomorphism ϕ′ : U ′ → Ω′
satisfies the requirements of part (ii). This proves Theorem 2.1.10.
The next corollary relates the notion of a smooth map on a smooth
submanifold as defined in the beginning of §2.1 to the standard notion of
smoothness in local coordinates used in the intrinsic setting of §2.8 below.
Corollary 2.1.11. Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-dimensional submanifold
and let f : M → Rℓ be a map. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) For every p0 ∈ M there exists an open neighborhood U ⊂ Rk of p0 and
a smooth map F : U → Rℓ that agrees with f on U ∩ M .
(ii) If U0 ⊂ M is an M -open set and ϕ0 : U0 → Ω0 is a diffeomorhism onto
ℓ
an open set Ω0 ⊂ Rm , then the composition f ◦ ϕ−1
0 : Ω0 → R is smooth.
Proof. Assume (ii), let p0 ∈ M , and choose ϕ = (ϕ1 , . . . , ϕk ) : U → Ω ⊂ Rk
as in part (ii) of Theorem 2.1.10. Shrinking U , if necessary, we may assume
that Ω = Ω0 × Ω1 , where Ω0 ⊂ Rm is an open set and Ω1 ⊂ Rk−m is an
open neighborhood of the origin. Then the map Ω0 → Rℓ : x 7→ f ◦ ϕ−1 (x, 0)
is smooth by part (ii). Define F (p) := f ◦ ϕ−1 (ϕ1 (p), . . . , ϕm (p), 0, . . . , 0)
for p ∈ U . Then the map F : U → Rℓ is smooth and agrees with f on U ∩M .
Thus f satisfies (i). That (i) implies (ii) follows from Exercise 2.1.1 and this
proves Corollary 2.1.11.

Definition 2.1.12 (Regular value). Let U ⊂ Rk be an open set and
let f : U → Rℓ be a smooth map. An element c ∈ Rℓ is called a regular
value of f iff, for all p ∈ U , we have
f (p) = c

=⇒

df (p) : Rk → Rℓ is surjective.

Otherwise c is called a singular value of f . Theorem 2.1.10 asserts that,
if c is a regular value of f , then the preimage

M := f −1 (c) = p ∈ U f (p) = c
is a smooth (k − ℓ)-dimensional submanifold of Rk .

Examples and Exercises
Example 2.1.13. Let A = AT ∈ Rk×k be a symmetric matrix and define the function f : Rk → R by f (x) := xT Ax. Then df (x)ξ = 2xT Aξ
for x, ξ ∈ Rk and hence the linear map df (x) : Rk → R is surjective if and
only if Ax ̸= 0. Thus c = 0 is the only singular value of f and hence, for
every element c ∈ R \ {0}, the set M := f −1 (c) = {x ∈ Rk | xT Ax = c} is a
smooth manifold of dimension m = k − 1.
Example 2.1.14 (The sphere). As a special case of Example 2.1.13 consider the case k = m + 1, A = 1l, and c = 1. Then f (x) = |x|2 and so we
have another proof that the unit sphere
n
o
S m = x ∈ Rm+1 |x|2 = 1
in Rm+1 is a smooth m-manifold. (See Examples 1.2.4 and 2.1.5.)
Example 2.1.15. Define the map f : R3 × R3 → R by f (x, y) := |x − y|2 .
This is another special case of Example 2.1.13 and so, for every r > 0, the
set M := {(x, y) ∈ R3 × R3 | |x − y| = r} is a smooth 5-manifold.
Example 2.1.16 (The 2-torus). Let 0 < r < 1 and define f : R3 → R by
f (x, y, z) := (x2 + y 2 + r2 − z 2 − 1)2 − 4(x2 + y 2 )(r2 − z 2 ).
This map has zero as a regular value and M := f −1 (0) is diffeomorphic to
the 2-torus T2 = S 1 × S 1 . An explicit diffeomorphism is given by

(eis , eit ) 7→ (1 + r cos(s)) cos(t), (1 + r cos(s)) sin(t), r sin(s) .
This example corresponds to the second surface in Figure 2.2.

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Example 2.1.17. The set

M := (x2 , y 2 , z 2 , yz, zx, xy) | x, y, z ∈ R, x2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1
is a smooth 2-manifold in R6 . To see this, define an equivalence relation on
the unit sphere S 2 ⊂ R3 by p ∼ q iff q = ±p. The quotient space (the set of
equivalence classes) is called the real projective plane and is denoted by
RP2 := S 2 /{±1}.
(See Example 1.2.6.) It is equipped with the quotient topology, i.e. a subset U ⊂ RP2 is open, by definition, iff its preimage under the obvious projection S 2 → RP2 is an open subset of S 2 . Now the map f : S 2 → R6 defined
by
f (x, y, z) := (x2 , y 2 , z 2 , yz, zx, xy)
descends to a homeomorphism from RP2 onto M . The submanifold M is
covered by the local smooth parameterizations
p
Ω → M : (x, y) 7→ f (x, y, 1 − x2 − y 2 ),
p
Ω → M : (x, z) 7→ f (x, 1 − x2 − z 2 , z),
p
Ω → M : (y, z) 7→ f ( 1 − y 2 − z 2 , y, z),
defined on the open unit disc Ω ⊂ R2 . We remark the following.
(a) M is not the preimage of a regular value under a smooth map R6 → R4 .
(b) M is not diffeomorphic to a submanifold of R3 .

(c) The projection Σ := (yz, zx, xy) | x, y, z ∈ R, x2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1 of M
onto the last three coordinates is called the Roman surface and was discovered by Jakob Steiner. The Roman surface can also be represented as
the set of solutions (ξ, η, ζ) ∈ R3 of the equation η 2 ζ 2 + ζ 2 ξ 2 + ξ 2 η 2 = ξηζ.
It is not a submanifold of R3 .
Exercise: Prove this. Show that M is diffeomorphic to a submanifold of R4 .
Show that M is diffeomorphic to RP2 as defined in Example 1.2.6.

Prove that the derivative of the function f = det : Rn×n → R is given by
df (g)v = det(g) trace(g −1 v)
for all g ∈ GL(n, R) and v ∈ Rn×n . Deduce that the special linear group
SL(n, R) := {g ∈ GL(n, R) | det(g) = 1}
is a smooth submanifold of Rn×n .
Example 2.1.20. The orthogonal group

o
O(n) := g ∈ Rn×n | g T g = 1l

n
o
Sn := S ∈ Rn×n | S T = S
the vector space of symmetric matrices and define f : Rn×n → Sn by
f (g) := g T g.
Its derivative df (g) : Rn×n → Sn is given by
df (g)v = g T v + v T g.
This map is surjective for every g ∈ O(n): if g T g = 1l and S = S T ∈ Sn ,
then the matrix v := 21 gS satisfies
1

df (g)v = g T gS + (gS)T g = S + S T = S.

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Tangent Spaces and Derivatives

The main reason for first discussing the extrinsic notion of embedded manifolds in Euclidean space as explained in the Master Plan §1.5 is that the
concept of a tangent vector is much easier to digest in the embedded case:
it is simply the derivative of a curve in M , understood as a vector in the
ambient Euclidean space in which M is embedded.

2.2.1

Tangent Space

Definition 2.2.1 (Tangent vector). Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-dimensional manifold and fix a point p ∈ M . A vector v ∈ Rk is called a tangent
vector of M at p iff there exists a smooth curve γ : R → M such that
γ(0) = p,

γ̇(0) = v.

The set
Tp M := {γ̇(0) | γ : R → M is smooth, γ(0) = p}
of tangent vectors of M at p is called the tangent space of M at p.
Theorem 2.2.3 below shows that Tp M is a linear subspace of Rk . As does
any linear subspace it contains the origin; it need not actually intersect M .
Its translate p + Tp M touches M at p; this is what you should visualize
for Tp M (see Figure 2.4).

Remark 2.2.2. Let p ∈ M be as in Definition 2.2.1 and let v ∈ Rk . Then

∃ε > 0 ∃γ : (−ε, ε) → M such that
v ∈ Tp M
⇐⇒
γ is smooth, γ(0) = p, γ̇(0) = v.
To see this suppose that γ : (−ε, ε) → M is a smooth curve with γ(0) = p
and γ̇(0) = v. Define γ

Theorem 2.2.3 (Tangent spaces). Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-dimensional manifold and fix a point p ∈ M . Then the following holds.
(i) Let U0 ⊂ M be an M -open set with p ∈ U0 and let ϕ0 : U0 → Ω0
be a diffeomorphism onto an open subset Ω0 ⊂ Rm . Let x0 := ϕ0 (p) and
let ψ0 := ϕ−1
0 : Ω0 → U0 be the inverse map. Then


Tp M = im dψ0 (x0 ) : Rm → Rk .
(ii) Let U, Ω ⊂ Rk be open sets and ϕ : U → Ω be a diffeomorphism such
that p ∈ U and ϕ(U ∩ M ) = Ω ∩ (Rm × {0}). Then
Tp M = dϕ(p)−1 (Rm × {0}) .
(iii) Let U ⊂ Rk be an open neighborhood of p and f : U → Rk−m be a
smooth map such that 0 is a regular value of f and U ∩ M = f −1 (0). Then
Tp M = ker df (p).
(iv) Tp M is an m-dimensional linear subspace of Rk .
Proof. Let ψ0 : Ω0 → U0 and x0 ∈ Ω0 be as in (i) and let ϕ : U → Ω be as
in (ii). We prove that
im dψ0 (x0 ) ⊂ Tp M ⊂ dϕ(p)−1 (Rm × {0}) .

(2.2.1)

To prove the first inclusion in (2.2.1), choose a constant r > 0 such that
Br (x0 ) := {x ∈ Rm | |x − x0 | < r} ⊂ Ω0 .
Now let ξ ∈ Rm and choose ε > 0 so small that
ε |ξ| ≤ r.
Then x0 + tξ ∈ Ω0 for all t ∈ R with |t| < ε. Define γ : (−ε, ε) → M by
γ(t) := ψ0 (x0 + tξ)

for − ε < t < ε.

Then γ is a smooth curve in M satisfying
γ(0) = ψ0 (x0 ) = p,

γ̇(0) =

d
ψ0 (x0 + tξ) = dψ0 (x0 )ξ.
dt t=0

Hence it follows from Remark 2.2.2 that dψ0 (x0 )ξ ∈ Tp M , as claimed.

26

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

To prove the second inclusion in (2.2.1) we fix a vector v ∈ Tp M . Then,
by definition of the tangent space, there exists a smooth curve γ : R → M
such that γ(0) = p and γ̇(0) = v. Let U ⊂ Rk be as in (ii) and choose ε > 0
so small that γ(t) ∈ U for |t| < ε. Then
ϕ(γ(t)) ∈ ϕ(U ∩ M ) ⊂ Rm × {0}
for |t| < ε and hence
dϕ(p)v = dϕ(γ(0))γ̇(0) =

d
ϕ(γ(t)) ∈ Rm × {0}.
dt t=0

This shows that v ∈ dϕ(p)−1 (Rm × {0}) and thus we have proved (2.2.1).
Now the sets im dψ0 (x0 ) and dϕ(p)−1 (Rm × {0}) are both m-dimensional
linear subspaces of Rk . Hence it follows from (2.2.1) that these subspaces
agree and that they both agree with Tp M . Thus we have proved assertions (i), (ii), and (iv).
We prove (iii). Let v ∈ Tp M . Then there is a smooth curve γ : R → M
such that γ(0) = p and γ̇(0) = v. For t sufficiently small we have γ(t) ∈ U ,
where U ⊂ Rk is the open set in (iii), and f (γ(t)) = 0. Hence
df (p)v = df (γ(0))γ̇(0) =

d
f (γ(t)) = 0.
dt t=0

This implies Tp M ⊂ ker df (p). Since Tp M and the kernel of df (p) are both
m-dimensional linear subspaces of Rk , we deduce that Tp M = ker df (p).
This proves part (iii) and Theorem 2.2.3.
Exercise 2.2.4. Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-dimensional manifold and
let pi ∈ M be a sequence that converges to a point p ∈ M . Let τi be a
sequence of nonzero real numbers and let v ∈ Rk such that

Prove that v ∈ Tp M . Hint: Use part (iii) of Theorem 2.2.3.
Example 2.2.5. Let A = AT ∈ Rk×k be a nonzero matrix as in Example 2.1.13 and let c ̸= 0. Then part (iii) of Theorem 2.2.3 asserts that the
tangent space of the manifold

Example 2.2.6. As a special case of Example 2.2.5 with A = 1l and c = 1
we find that the tangent space of the unit sphere S m ⊂ Rm+1 at a point
x ∈ S m is the orthogonal complement of x. i.e.

Tx S m = x⊥ = ξ ∈ Rm+1 | ⟨x, ξ⟩ = 0 .

Exercise 2.2.7. What is the tangent space of the 5-manifold

M := (x, y) ∈ R3 × R3 | |x − y| = r
at a point (x, y) ∈ M ? (See Exercise 2.1.15.)
Example 2.2.8. Let H(x, y) := 21 |y|2 + V (x) be as in Exercise 2.1.18 and
let c be a regular value of H. If (x, y) ∈ M := H −1 (c), then
T(x,y) M = {(ξ, η) ∈ Rn × Rn | ⟨y, η⟩ + ⟨∇V (x), ξ⟩ = 0} .
Here ∇V := (∂V /∂x1 , . . . , ∂V /∂xn ) : Rn → Rn denotes the gradient of V .
Exercise 2.2.9. The tangent space of SL(n, R) at the identity matrix is the
space

sl(n, R) := T1l SL(n, R) = ξ ∈ Rn×n | trace(ξ) = 0
of traceless matrices. (Prove this, using Exercise 2.1.19.)
Example 2.2.10. The tangent space of O(n) at g is
n
o
Tg O(n) = v ∈ Rn×n | g T v + v T g = 0 .
In particular, the tangent space of O(n) at the identity matrix is the space
of skew-symmetric matrices
n
o
o(n) := T1l O(n) = ξ ∈ Rn×n | ξ T + ξ = 0
To see this, choose a smooth curve R → O(n) : t 7→ g(t). Then g(t)T g(t) = 1l
for all t ∈ R and, differentiating this identity with respect to t, we obtain g(t)T ġ(t) + ġ(t)T g(t) = 0 for every t. Hence every matrix v ∈ Tg O(n)
satisfies the equation g T v + v T g = 0. With this understood, the claim follows from the fact that g T v + v T g = 0 if and only if the matrix ξ := g −1 v
is skew-symmetric and that the space of skew-symmetric matrices in Rn×n
has dimension n(n − 1)/2.
Exercise 2.2.11. Let Ω ⊂ Rm be an open set and h : Ω → Rk−m be a
smooth map. Prove that the tangent space of the graph of h at a point
(x, h(x)) is the graph of the derivative dh(x) : Rm → Rk−m :
M = {(x, h(x)) | x ∈ Ω} ,

T(x,h(x)) M = {(ξ, dh(x)ξ) | ξ ∈ Rm } .

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Exercise 2.2.12 (Monge coordinates). Let M be a smooth m-manifold
in Rk and suppose that p ∈ M is such that the projection Tp M → Rm × {0}
is invertible. Prove that there exists an open set Ω ⊂ Rm and a smooth
map h : Ω → Rk−m such that the graph of h is an M -open neighborhood
of p (see Example 2.1.6). Of course, the projection Tp M → Rm × {0} need

k
not be invertible, but it must be invertible for at least one of the m
choices
of the m-dimensional coordinate plane. Hence every point of M has an M open neighborhood which may be expressed as a graph of a function of some
of the coordinates in terms of the others as in e.g. Example 2.1.5.

2.2.2

Derivative

A key purpose behind the concept of a smooth manifold is to carry over
the notion of a smooth map and its derivatives from the realm of first year
analysis to the present geometric setting. Here is the basic definition. It appeals to the notion of a smooth map between arbitrary subsets of Euclidean
spaces as introduced in the beginning of §2.1.
Definition 2.2.13 (Derivative). Let M ⊂ Rk be an m-dimensional smooth
manifold and let
f : M → Rℓ
be a smooth map. The derivative of f at a point p ∈ M is the map
df (p) : Tp M → Rℓ
defined as follows. Given a tangent vector v ∈ Tp M , choose a smooth curve
γ:R→M
satisfying
γ(0) = p,

γ̇(0) = v,

and define the vector df (p)v ∈ Rℓ by
df (p)v :=

d
f (γ(h)) − f (p)
f (γ(t)) = lim
.
h→0
dt t=0
h

(2.2.2)

That the limit on the right in equation (2.2.2) exists follows from our
assumptions. We must prove, however, that the derivative is well defined,
i.e. that the right hand side of (2.2.2) depends only on the tangent vector v
and not on the choice of the curve γ used in the definition. This is the
content of the first assertion in the next theorem.

2.2. TANGENT SPACES AND DERIVATIVES

Theorem 2.2.14 (Derivatives). Let M ⊂ Rk be an m-dimensional smooth
manifold and f : M → Rℓ be a smooth map. Fix a point p ∈ M . Then the
following holds.
(i) The right hand side of (2.2.2) is independent of γ.
(ii) The map df (p) : Tp M → Rℓ is linear.
(iii) If N ⊂ Rℓ is a smooth n-manifold and f (M ) ⊂ N , then
df (p)Tp M ⊂ Tf (p) N.
(iv) (Chain Rule) Let N be as in (iii), suppose that f (M ) ⊂ N , and
let g : N → Rd be a smooth map. Then
d(g ◦ f )(p) = dg(f (p)) ◦ df (p) : Tp M → Rd .
(v) If f = id : M → M , then df (p) = id : Tp M → Tp M .
Proof. We prove (i). Let v ∈ Tp M and γ : R → M be as in Definition 2.2.13.
By definition there is an open neighborhood U ⊂ Rk of p and a smooth
map F : U → Rℓ such that
F (p′ ) = f (p′ )

for all p′ ∈ U ∩ M.

Let dF (p) ∈ Rℓ×k denote the Jacobian matrix (i.e. the matrix of all first
partial derivatives) of F at p. Then, since γ(t) ∈ U ∩ M for t sufficiently
small, we have
dF (p)v = dF (γ(0))γ̇(0)

The right hand side of this identity is independent of the choice of F while
the left hand side is independent of the choice of γ. Hence the right hand
side is also independent of the choice of γ and this proves (i). Assertion (ii)
follows immediately from the identity
df (p)v = dF (p)v
just established.

Assertion (iii) follows directly from the definitions. Namely, if γ is as in
Definition 2.2.13, then β := f ◦ γ : R → N is a smooth curve in N satisfying
β(0) = f (γ(0)) = f (p) =: q,

β̇(0) = df (p)v =: w.

Hence w ∈ Tq N . Assertion (iv) also follows directly from the definitions.

This proves (iv). Assertion (v) follows again directly from the definitions
and this proves Theorem 2.2.14.
Corollary 2.2.15 (Diffeomorphisms). Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold and N ⊂ Rℓ be a smooth n-manifold and let f : M → N be a diffeomorphism. Assume M and N are nonempty. Then m = n and the derivative df (p) : Tp M → Tf (p) N is a vector space isomorphism with inverse
df (p)−1 = df −1 (f (p)) : Tf (p) N → Tp M
for all p ∈ M .
Proof. Define g := f −1 : N → M so that g ◦ f = idM and f ◦ g = idN .
Then it follows from Theorem 2.2.14 that, for p ∈ M and q := f (p) ∈ N , we
have dg(q) ◦ df (p) = id : Tp M → Tp M and df (p) ◦ dg(q) = id : Tq N → Tq N.
Hence df (p) : Tp M → Tq N is a vector space isomorphism and its inverse is
given by dg(q) = df (p)−1 : Tq N → Tp M. Hence m = n and this proves
Corollary 2.2.15.

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Regular Values
Definition 2.2.18 (Regular value). Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold,
let N ⊂ Rℓ be a smooth n-manifold, and let f : M → N be a smooth map.
An element q ∈ N is called a regular value of f iff, for every p ∈ M
with f (p) = q, the derivative df (p) : Tp M → Tf (p) N is surjective.
Theorem 2.2.19 (Regular values). Let f : M → N be as in Definition 2.2.18 and let q ∈ N be a regular value of f . Then the set
P := f −1 (q) = {p ∈ M | f (p) = q}
is a smooth submanifold of Rk of dimension m − n and, for each point p ∈ P ,
its tangent space at p is given by
Tp P = ker df (p) = {v ∈ Tp M | df (p)v = 0} .
Proof 1. Fix a point p0 ∈ P and choose a linear map A : Rk → Rm−n such
that the restriction of A to the (m − n)-dimensional linear subspace
ker df (p0 ) = {v ∈ Tp0 M | df (p0 ) = 0} ⊂ Tp0 M ⊂ Rk
is a vector space isomorphism. Define the map F : M → N × Rm−n by
F (p) := (f (p), Ap)
for p ∈ M . The derivative of F at p0 is given by dF (p0 )v = (df (p0 )v, Av)
for v ∈ Tp0 M and is a vector space isomorphism. Hence, by Theorem 2.2.17
there exists an M -open neighborhood U ⊂ M of p0 such that V := F (U )
is an open subset of N × Rm−n in the relative topology and the restriction F |U : U → V is a diffeomorphism. Hence the P -open set U ∩ P is
diffeomorphic to the open set Ω := {y ∈ Rm−n | (q, y) ∈ V } ⊂ Rm−n by the
diffeomorphism ϕ : U ∩ P → Ω, defined by ϕ(p) := Ap for p ∈ U ∩ P , whose
inverse is the smooth map ψ : Ω → U ∩ P given by ψ(y) = (F |U )−1 (q, y)
for y ∈ Ω. This shows that P is a smooth (m − n)-manifold in Rk .
Now let p ∈ P and v ∈ Tp P . Then there exists a smooth curve γ : R → P
such that γ(0) = p and γ̇(0) = v. Since f (γ(t)) = q for all t, we have
df (p)v =

d
f (γ(t)) = 0
dt t=0

and so v ∈ ker df (p). Hence Tp P ⊂ ker df (p) and equality holds because
both Tp P and ker df (p) are (m − n)-dimensional linear subspaces of Rk .
This proves Theorem 2.2.19.

2.2. TANGENT SPACES AND DERIVATIVES

Proof 2. Here is another proof of Theorem 2.2.19 in local coordinates. Fix
a point p0 ∈ P and choose a coordinate chart ϕ0 : U0 → ϕ0 (U0 ) ⊂ Rm on
an M -open neighborhood U0 ⊂ M of p0 . Likewise, choose a coordinate
chart ψ0 : V0 → ψ0 (V0 ) ⊂ Rn on an N -open neighborhood V0 ⊂ N of q.
Shrinking U0 , if necessary, we may assume that f (U0 ) ⊂ V0 . Then the
point c0 := ψ0 (q) is a regular value of the map
n
f0 := ψ0 ◦ f ◦ ϕ−1
0 : ϕ0 (U0 ) → R .

Namely, if x ∈ ϕ0 (U0 ) satisfies f0 (x) = c0 , then p := ϕ−1
0 (x) ∈ U0 ∩ P , so the
−1
m
maps dϕ0 (x) : R → Tp M , df (p) : Tp M → Tq N , and dψ0 (q) : Tq N → Rn
are all surjective, hence so is their composition, and by the chain rule this
composition is the derivative df0 (x) : Rm → Rn . With this understood, it
follows from Theorem 2.1.10 that the set

f0−1 (c0 ) = x ∈ ϕ0 (U0 ) | f (ϕ−1
0 (x)) = q = ϕ0 (U0 ∩ P )
is a manifold of of dimension m − n contained in the open set ϕ0 (U0 ) ⊂ Rm .
Using Definition 2.1.3 and shrinking U0 further, if necessary, we may assume
that the set ϕ0 (U0 ∩ P ) is diffeomorphic to an open subset of Rm−n . Composing this diffeomorphism with ϕ0 we find that U0 ∩ P is diffeomorphic to
the same open subset of Rm−n . Since the set U0 ⊂ M is M -open, there
exists an open set U ⊂ Rk such that U ∩ M = U0 , hence U ∩ P = U0 ∩ P ,
and so U0 ∩ P is a P -open neighborhood of p0 . Thus we have proved
that every element p0 ∈ P has a P -open neigborhood that is diffeomorphic to an open subset of Rm−n . Thus P ⊂ Rk is a manifold of dimension m − n (Definition 2.1.3). The proof that the tangent spaces of P are
given by Tp P = ker df (p) remains unchanged and this completes the second
proof of Theorem 2.2.19.
Definition 2.2.20. Let M ⊂ Rk and N ⊂ Rℓ be smooth m-manifolds. A
smooth map f : M → N is called a local diffeomorphism iff its derivative df (p) : Tp M → Tf (p) N is a vector space isomorphism for every p ∈ M .
Example 2.2.21. The inclusion of an M -open subset U ⊂ M into M and
the map R → S 1 : t 7→ eit are examples of local diffeomorphisms.
Exercise 2.2.22. Prove that the image of a local diffeomorphism is an open
subset of the target manifold. Hint: Use the Inverse Function Theorem.
In the terminology introduced in §2.3 and §2.6.1 below, local diffeomorphisms are both immersions and submersions. In particular, if f : M → N
is a local diffeomorphism, then every element q ∈ N is a regular value of f
and its preimage f −1 (q) is a discrete subset of M .

Submanifolds and Embeddings

This section deals with subsets of a manifold M that are themselves manifolds as in Definition 2.1.3. Such subsets are called submanifolds of M .
Definition 2.3.1 (Submanifold). Let M ⊂ Rk be an m-dimensional manifold. A subset P ⊂ M is called a submanifold of M of dimension n, iff P
itself is an n-manifold.
Definition 2.3.2 (Embedding). Let M ⊂ Rk be an m-dimensional manifold and N ⊂ Rℓ be an n-dimensional manifold. A smooth map f : N → M
is called an immersion iff its derivatve df (q) : Tq N → Tf (q) M is injective
for every q ∈ N . It is called proper iff, for every compact subset K ⊂ f (N ),
the preimage f −1 (K) = {q ∈ N | f (q) ∈ K} is compact. The map f is called
an embedding iff it is a proper injective immersion.
Remark 2.3.3. In our definition of proper maps it is important that the
compact set K is required to be contained in the image of f . The literature
also contains a stronger definition of proper which requires that f −1 (K) is
a compact subset of N for every compact subset K ⊂ M , whether or not K
is contained in the image of f . This holds if and only if the map f is proper
in the sense of Definition 2.3.2 and has an M -closed image. (Exercise!)

Theorem 2.3.4 (Submanifolds). Let M ⊂ Rk be an m-dimensional manifold and N ⊂ Rℓ be an n-dimensional manifold.
(i) If f : N → M is an embedding, then f (N ) is a submanifold of M .
(ii) If P ⊂ M is a submanifold, then the inclusion P → M is an embedding.
(iii) A subset P ⊂ M is a submanifold of dimension n if and only if, for
every p0 ∈ P , there exists a coordinate chart ϕ : U → Rm on an M -open
neighborhood U of p0 such that ϕ(U ∩ P ) = ϕ(U ) ∩ (Rn × {0}) (Figure 2.6).
(iv) A subset P ⊂ M is a submanifold of dimension n if and only if, for every p0 ∈ P , there exists an M -open neighborhood U ⊂ M of p0 and a smooth
map g : U → Rm−n such that 0 is a regular value of g and U ∩ P = g −1 (0).
The proof is pased on the following lemma.

2.3. SUBMANIFOLDS AND EMBEDDINGS

Lemma 2.3.5 (Embeddings). Let M and N be as in Theorem 2.3.4,
let f : N → M be an embedding, let q0 ∈ N , and define
P := f (N ),

p0 := f (q0 ) ∈ P.

Then there exists an M -open neighborhood U ⊂ M of p0 , an N -open neighborhood V ⊂ N of q0 , an open neighborhood W ⊂ Rm−n of the origin, and
a diffeomorphism F : V × W → U such that, for all q ∈ V and all z ∈ W ,
F (q, 0) = f (q),
F (q, z) ∈ P

⇐⇒

(2.3.1)
z = 0.

(2.3.2)

Proof. Choose any coordinate chart ϕ0 : U0 → Rm on an M -open neighborhood U0 ⊂ M of p0 . Then d(ϕ0 ◦ f )(q0 ) = dϕ0 (f (q0 )) ◦ df (q0 ) : Tq0 N → Rm
is injective. Hence there is a linear map B : Rm−n → Rm such that the map
Tq0 N × Rm−n → Rm : (w, ζ) 7→ d(ϕ0 ◦ f )(q0 )w + Bζ

(2.3.3)

is a vector space isomorphism. Define the set

Ω := (q, z) ∈ N × Rm−n | f (q) ∈ U0 , ϕ0 (f (q)) + Bz ∈ ϕ0 (U0 ) .
This is an open subset of N × Rm−n and we define F : Ω → M by
F (q, z) := ϕ−1
0 (ϕ0 (f (q)) + Bz) .
This map is smooth, it satisfies F (q, 0) = f (q) for all q ∈ f −1 (U0 ), and
the derivative dF (q0 , 0) : Tq0 N × Rm−n → Tp0 M is the composition of the
map (2.3.3) with dϕ0 (p0 )−1 : Rm → Tp0 M and so is a vector space isomorphism. Thus the Inverse Function Theorem 2.2.17 asserts that there is an
N -open neighborhood V0 ⊂ N of q0 and an open neighborhood W0 ⊂ Rm−n
of the origin such that V0 × W0 ⊂ Ω, the set U0 := F (V0 × W0 ) is M -open,
and the restriction of F to V0 × W0 is a diffeomorphism onto U0 . Thus we
have constructed a diffeomorphism F : V0 × W0 → U0 that satisfies (2.3.1).
We claim that the restriction of F to the product V × W of sufficiently
small open neighborhoods V ⊂ N of q0 and W ⊂ Rm−n of the origin also
satisfies (2.3.2). Otherwise, there exist sequences qi ∈ V0 converging to q0
and zi ∈ W0 \ {0} converging to zero such that F (qi , zi ) ∈ P . Hence there
exists a sequence qi′ ∈ N such that F (qi , zi ) = f (qi′ ). This sequence converges
to f (q0 ). Since f is proper we may assume, passing to a suitable subsequence
if necessary, that qi′ converges to a point q0′ ∈ N . Then
f (q0′ ) = lim f (qi′ ) = lim F (qi , zi ) = f (q0 ).
i→∞

i→∞

36

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Since f is injective, this implies q0′ = q0 . Hence (qi′ , 0) ∈ V0 × W0 for i
sufficiently large and F (qi′ , 0) = f (qi′ ) = F (qi , zi ). This contradicts the fact
that the map F : V0 × W0 → M is injective, and proves Lemma 2.3.5.
Proof of Theorem 2.3.4. We prove (i). Let q0 ∈ N , denote p0 := f (q0 ) ∈ P ,
and choose a diffeomorphism F : V × W → U as in Lemma 2.3.5. Then the
set V ⊂ N is diffeomorphic to an open subset of Rn (after schrinking V
if necessary), the set U ∩ P is P -open because U ⊂ M is M -open, and we
have U ∩ P = {F (q, 0) | q ∈ V } = f (V ) by (2.3.1) and (2.3.2). Hence the
map f : V → U ∩ P is a diffeomorphism whose inverse is the composition
of the smooth maps F −1 : U ∩ P → V × W and V × W → V : (q, z) 7→ q.
Hence a P -open neighborhood of p0 is diffeomorphic to an open subset of Rn .
Since p0 ∈ P was chosen arbitrary, this shows that P is an n-dimensional
submanifold of M .
We prove (ii). The inclusion ι : P → M is obviously smooth and injective (it extends to the identity map on Rk ). Moreover, Tp P ⊂ Tp M for
every p ∈ P and the derivative dι(p) : Tp P → Tp M is the obvious inclusion
for every p ∈ P . That ι is proper follows immediately from the definition.
Hence ι is an embedding.
We prove (iii). If a coordinate chart ϕ as in (iii) exists, then the set U ∩ P
is P -open and is diffeomorphic to an open subset of Rn . Since p0 ∈ P
was chosen arbitrary this proves that P is an n-dimensional submanifold
of M . Conversely, suppose that P is an n-dimensional submanifold of M and
let p0 ∈ P . Choose any coordinate chart ϕ0 : U0 → Rm of M defined on an
M -open neighborhood U0 ⊂ M of p0 . Then ϕ0 (U0 ∩ P ) is an n-dimensional
submanifold of Rm . Hence Theorem 2.1.10 asserts that there are open
sets V, W ⊂ Rm with p0 ∈ V ⊂ ϕ0 (U0 ) and a diffeomorphism ψ : V → W
such that
ϕ0 (p0 ) ∈ V,

ψ(V ∩ ϕ0 (U0 ∩ P )) = W ∩ (Rn × {0}).

Now define U := ϕ−1
0 (V ) ⊂ U0 . Then p0 ∈ U , the chart ϕ0 restricts to a
diffeomorphism from U to V , the composition ϕ := ψ ◦ ϕ0 |U : U → W is a
diffeomorphism, and ϕ(U ∩ P ) = ψ(V ∩ ϕ0 (U0 ∩ P )) = W ∩ (Rn × {0}).
We prove (iv). That the condition is sufficient follows directly from
Theorem 2.2.19. To prove that it is necessary, assume that P ⊂ M is a
submanifold of dimension n, fix an element p0 ∈ P , and choose a coordinate chart ϕ : U → Rm on an M -open neighborhood U ⊂ M of p0 as in
part (iii). Define the map g : U → Rm−n by g(p) := (ϕn+1 (p), . . . , ϕm (p))
for p ∈ U . Then 0 is a regular value of g and g −1 (0) = U ∩ P . This proves
Theorem 2.3.4.

The image f (S 1 ) is a figure 8 in R2 and is not a submanifold (Figure 2.7).
The restriction of f to the submanifold N := S 1 \ {(0, −1)} is an injective immersion but it is not proper. It has the same image as before and
hence f (N ) is not a manifold.

Example 2.3.8. The map f : R → R2 given by f (t) := (t2 , t3 ) is proper

Example 2.3.9. Define the map f : R → R2 by f (t) := (cos(t), sin(t)). This
map is an immersion, but it is neither injective nor proper. However, its
image is the unit circle in R2 and hence is a submanifold of R2 . The
map R → R2 : t 7→ f (t3 ) is not an immersion and is neither injective nor
proper, but its image is still the unit circle.

Vector Fields and Flows

This section introduces vector fields on manifolds (§2.4.1), explains the flow
of a vector field and the group of diffeomorphisms (§2.4.2), and defines the
Lie bracket of two vector fields (§2.4.3).

2.4.1

Vector Fields

Definition 2.4.1 (Vector field). Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold. A
(smooth) vector field on M is a smooth map X : M → Rk such that
X(p) ∈ Tp M
for every p ∈ M . The set of smooth vector fields on M will be denoted by
n
o
Vect(M ) := X : M → Rk | X is smooth, X(p) ∈ Tp M for all p ∈ M .
Exercise 2.4.2. Prove that the set of smooth vector fields on M is a real
vector space.
Example 2.4.3. Denote the standard cross product on R3 by


x 2 y3 − x 3 y2
x × y :=  x3 y1 − x1 y3 
x 1 y2 − x 2 y1
for x, y ∈ R3 . Fix a vector ξ ∈ S 2 and define the maps X, Y : S 2 → R3 by
X(p) := ξ × p,

Y (p) := (ξ × p) × p.

These are vector fields with zeros ±ξ. Their integral curves (see Definition 2.4.6 below) are illustrated in Figure 2.9.

map X : R2 → R2 . As an example consider the vector field
X(x, y) := (x, −y).

illustrated in Figure 2.10.

Definition 2.4.6 (Integral curve). Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold,
let X be a smooth vector field on M , and let I ⊂ R be an open interval.
A continuously differentiable curve γ : I → M is called an integral curve
of X iff it satisfies the equation γ̇(t) = X(γ(t)) for every t ∈ I. Note that
every integral curve of X is smooth.
Theorem 2.4.7. Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold and X ∈ Vect(M )
be a smooth vector field. Fix a point p0 ∈ M . Then the following holds.
(i) There exists an open interval I ⊂ R containing 0 and a smooth curve
γ : I → M satisfying the equation
γ̇(t) = X(γ(t)),

γ(0) = p0

(2.4.1)

for every t ∈ I.
(ii) If γ1 : I1 → M and γ2 : I2 → M are two solutions of (2.4.1) on open
intervals I1 and I2 containing 0, then γ1 (t) = γ2 (t) for every t ∈ I1 ∩ I2 .

Figure 2.11: Vector fields in local coordinates.
Proof. We prove (i). Let ϕ0 : U0 → Rm be a coordinate chart on M , defined
on an M -open neighborhood U0 ⊂ M of p0 . The image of ϕ0 is an open set
Ω := ϕ0 (U0 ) ⊂ Rm and we denote the inverse map by ψ0 := ϕ−1
0 : Ω → M
(see Figure 2.11). Then, by Theorem 2.2.3, the derivative dψ0 (x) : Rm → Rk
is injective and its image is the tangent space Tψ0 (x) M for every x ∈ Ω.
Define f : Ω → Rm by f (x) := dψ0 (x)−1 X(ψ0 (x)) for x ∈ Ω. This map
is smooth and hence, by the basic existence and uniqueness theorem for
ordinary differential equations in Rm (see [63]), the equation
ẋ(t) = f (x(t)),

x(0) = x0 := ϕ0 (p0 ),

(2.4.2)

has a solution x : I → Ω on some open interval I ⊂ R containing 0. Hence
the function γ := ψ0 ◦ x : I → U0 ⊂ M is a smooth solution of (2.4.1). This
proves (i).
The local uniqueness theorem asserts that two solutions γi : Ii → M
of (2.4.1) for i = 1, 2 agree on the interval (−ε, ε) ⊂ I1 ∩ I2 for ε > 0
sufficiently small. This follows immediately from the standard uniqueness
theorem for the solutions of (2.4.2) in [63] and the fact that x : I → Ω is a
solution of (2.4.2) if and only if γ := ψ0 ◦ x : I → U0 is a solution of (2.4.1).
To prove (ii) we observe that the set I := I1 ∩ I2 is an open interval
containing zero and hence is connected. Now consider the set
A := {t ∈ I | γ1 (t) = γ2 (t)} .
This set is nonempty, because 0 ∈ A. It is closed, relative to I, because the
maps γ1 : I → M and γ2 : I → M are continuous. Namely, if ti ∈ I is a
sequence converging to t ∈ I, then γ1 (ti ) = γ2 (ti ) for every i and, taking
the limit i → ∞, we obtain γ1 (t) = γ2 (t) and hence t ∈ A. The set A is also
open by the local uniqueness theorem. Since I is connected it follows that
A = I. This proves (ii) and Theorem 2.4.7.

The Flow of a Vector Field

Definition 2.4.8 (The flow of a vector field). Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth
m-manifold and X ∈ Vect(M ) be a smooth vector field on M . For p0 ∈ M
the maximal existence interval of p0 is the open interval

[
I ⊂ R is an open interval containing 0
.
I
I(p0 ) :=
and there is a solution γ : I → M of (2.4.1)
By Theorem 2.4.7 equation (2.4.1) has a solution γ : I(p0 ) → M . The flow
of X is the map ϕ : D → M defined by
D := {(t, p0 ) | p0 ∈ M, t ∈ I(p0 )}
and ϕ(t, p0 ) := γ(t), where γ : I(p0 ) → M is the unique solution of (2.4.1).
Theorem 2.4.9. Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold and X ∈ Vect(M )
be a smooth vector field on M . Let ϕ : D → M be the flow of X. Then the
following holds.
(i) D is an open subset of R × M .
(ii) The map ϕ : D → M is smooth.
(iii) Let p0 ∈ M and s ∈ I(p0 ). Then
I(ϕ(s, p0 )) = I(p0 ) − s

(2.4.3)

and, for every t ∈ R with s + t ∈ I(p0 ), we have
ϕ(s + t, p0 ) = ϕ(t, ϕ(s, p0 )).

(2.4.4)

The proof is pased on the following lemma.
Lemma 2.4.10. Let M , X, D, ϕ be as in Theorem 2.4.9 and let K ⊂ M be
a compact set. Then there exists an M -open set U ⊂ M and an ε > 0 such
that K ⊂ U , (−ε, ε) × U ⊂ D, and ϕ is smooth on (−ε, ε) × U .
Proof. In the case where M = Ω is an open subset of Rm this is proved
in [64, Satz 4.1.4 & Satz 4.3.1 & Satz 4.4.1]. Using local coordinates (as
in the proof of Theorem 2.4.7) we deduce that, for every p ∈ M , there
exists an M -open neighborhood Up ⊂ M of p and a constant εp > 0 such
that (−εp , εp ) × Up ⊂ D and the restriction of ϕ to (−εp , εp ) × Up is smooth.
Using this observation S
for every p ∈ K (and the axiom of choice) we obtain
an M -open cover K ⊂ p∈K Up . Since the set K is compact there exists a finite subcover K ⊂ Up1 ∪ · · · ∪ UpN =: U . Now define ε := min{εp1 , . . . , εpN }
to deduce that (−ε, ε) × U ⊂ D and ϕ is smooth on (−ε, ε) × U . This proves
Lemma 2.4.10.

42

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Proof of Theorem 2.4.9. We prove (iii). The map γ : I(p0 ) − s → M defined
by γ(t) := ϕ(s+t, p0 ) is a solution of the initial value problem γ̇(t) = X(γ(t))
with γ(0) = ϕ(s, p0 ). Hence I(p0 ) − s ⊂ I(ϕ(s, p0 )) and equation (2.4.4)
holds for every t ∈ R with s + t ∈ I(p0 ). In particular, with t = −s we
have p0 = ϕ(−s, ϕ(s, p0 )). Thus we obtain equality in equation (2.4.3) by
the same argument with the pair (s.p0 ) replaced by (−s, ϕ(s, p0 )).
We prove (i) and (ii). Let (t0 , p0 ) ∈ D so that p0 ∈ M and t0 ∈ I(p0 ).
Suppose t0 ≥ 0. Then K := {ϕ(t, p0 ) | 0 ≤ t ≤ t0 } is a compact subset
of M . (It is the image of the compact interval [0, t0 ] under the unique
solution γ : I(p0 ) → M of (2.4.1).) Hence, by Lemma 2.4.10, there is an
M -open set U ⊂ M and an ε > 0 such that
K ⊂ U,

(−ε, ε) × U ⊂ D,

and ϕ is smooth on (−ε, ε) × U . Choose N so large that t0 /N < ε. Define
U0 := U and, for k = 1, . . . , N , define the sets Uk ⊂ M inductively by
Uk := {p ∈ U | ϕ(t0 /N, p) ∈ Uk−1 } .
These sets are open in the relative topology of M .
We prove by induction on k that (−ε, kt0 /N + ε) × Uk ⊂ D and ϕ is
smooth on (−ε, kt0 /N + ε) × Uk . For k = 0 this holds by definition of ε
and U . If k ∈ {1, . . . , N } and the assertion holds for k − 1, then we have
p ∈ Uk

=⇒

p ∈ U, ϕ(t0 /N, p) ∈ Uk−1

=⇒

(−ε, ε) ⊂ I(p), (−ε, (k − 1)t0 /N + ε) ⊂ I(ϕ(t0 /N, p))

=⇒

(−ε, kt0 /N + ε) ⊂ I(p).

Here the last implication follows from (2.4.3). Moreover, for p ∈ Uk and
t0 /N − ε < t < kt0 /N + ε, we have, by (2.4.4), that
ϕ(t, p) = ϕ(t − t0 /N, ϕ(t0 /N, p))
Since ϕ(t0 /N, p) ∈ Uk−1 for p ∈ Uk the right hand side is a smooth map
on the open set (t0 /N − ε, kt0 /N + ε) × Uk . Since Uk ⊂ U , ϕ is also a
smooth map on (−ε, ε) × Uk and hence on (−ε, kt0 /N + ε) × Uk . This
completes the induction. With k = N we have found an open neighborhood
of (t0 , p0 ) contained in D, namely the set (−ε, t0 + ε) × UN , on which ϕ is
smooth. The case t0 ≤ 0 is treated similarly. This proves (i) and (ii) and
Theorem 2.4.9.
Definition 2.4.11. A vector field X ∈ Vect(M ) is called complete iff, for
each p0 ∈ M , there exists an integral curve γ : R → M of X with γ(0) = p0 .

2.4. VECTOR FIELDS AND FLOWS

43

Lemma 2.4.12. Let M ⊂ Rk be a compact manifold. Then every vector
field on M is complete.
Proof. Let X ∈ Vect(M ). It follows from Lemma 2.4.10 with K = M
that there exists an ε > 0 such that (−ε, ε) ⊂ I(p) for all p ∈ M . By Theorem 2.4.9 this implies I(p) = R for all p ∈ M . Hence X is complete.
Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth manifold and X ∈ Vect(M ). Then
X is complete

⇐⇒

I(p) = R ∀ p ∈ M

⇐⇒

D = R × M.

Assume X is complete, let ϕ : R × M → M be the flow of X, and define
the map ϕt : M → M by ϕt (p) := ϕ(t, p) for t ∈ R and p ∈ M . Then
Theorem 2.4.9 asserts that ϕt is smooth for every t ∈ R and that
ϕs+t = ϕs ◦ ϕt ,

ϕ0 = id

(2.4.5)

for all s, t ∈ R. In particular, this implies that ϕt ◦ ϕ−t = ϕ−t ◦ ϕt = id.
Hence ϕt is bijective and (ϕt )−1 = ϕ−t , so each ϕt is a diffeomorphism.
Exercise 2.4.13. Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth manifold. A vector field X on M
is said to have compact support iff there exists a compact subset K ⊂ M
such that X(p) = 0 for every p ∈ M \ K. Prove that every vector field with
compact support is complete.
We close this subsection with an important observation about incomplete
vector fields. The lemma asserts that an integral curve on a finite existence
interval must leave every compact subset of M .
Lemma 2.4.14. Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold, let X ∈ Vect(M ),
let ϕ : D → M be the flow of X, let K ⊂ M be a compact set, and let p0 ∈ M
be an element such that
I(p0 ) ∩ [0, ∞) = [0, b),

0 < b < ∞.

Then there exists a number 0 < tK < b such that
tK < t < b

=⇒

ϕ(t, p0 ) ∈ M \ K

Proof. By Lemma 2.4.10 there exists an ε > 0 such that (−ε, ε) ⊂ I(p) for
every p ∈ K. Choose ε so small that ε < b and define
tK := b − ε > 0.
Choose a real number tK < t < b. Then I(ϕ(t, p0 )) ∩ [0, ∞) = [0, b − t) by
equation (2.4.3) in part (ii) of Theorem 2.4.9. Since 0 < b − t < b − tK = ε,
this shows that (−ε, ε) ̸⊂ I(ϕ(t, p0 )) and hence ϕ(t, p0 ) ∈
/ K. This proves
Lemma 2.4.14.

44

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

The next corollary is an immediate consequence of Lemma 2.4.14. In
this formulation the result will be used in §4.6 and in §7.3.
Corollary 2.4.15. Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold, let X ∈ Vect(M ),
and let γ : (0, T ) → M be an integral curve of X. If there exists a compact
set K ⊂ M that contains the image of γ, then γ extends to an integral curve
of X on the interval (−ρ, T + ρ) for some ρ > 0.
Proof. Here is another more direct proof that does not rely on Lemma 2.4.10.
Since K is compact, there exists a constant c > 0 such that |X(p)| ≤ c for
all p ∈ K. Since γ(t) ∈ K for 0 < t < T , this implies
Z t
Z t
Z t
|γ(t) − γ(s)| =
γ̇(r) dr ≤
|γ̇(r)| dr =
|X(γ(r))| dr ≤ c(t − s)

for 0 < s < t < T . Thus the limit p0 := limt↘0 γ(t) exists in Rk and, since K
is a closed subset of Rk , we have p0 ∈ K ⊂ M . Define γ0 : [0, T ) → M by

p0 ,
for t = 0,
γ0 (t) :=
γ(t), for 0 < t < T.
We prove that γ0 is differentiable at t = 0 and γ̇0 (0) = X(p0 ). To see this, fix
a constant ε > 0. Since the curve [0, T ) → Rk : t 7→ X(γ(t)) is continuous,
there exists a constant δ > 0 such that
0<t≤δ

=⇒

|X(γ(t)) − X(p0 )| ≤ ε.

Hence, for 0 < s < t ≤ δ, we have
Z t
(γ̇(r) − X(p0 )) dr

|γ(t) − γ(s) − (t − s)X(p0 )| =
s

Z t
(X(γ(r)) − X(p0 )) dr

=
s
Z t

|X(γ(r)) − X(p0 )| dr

≤ (t − s)ε.
Take the limit s → 0 to obtain
γ(t) − p0
|γ(t) − γ(s) − (t − s)X(p0 )|
− X(p0 ) = lim
≤ε
s→0
t
t−s
for 0 < t ≤ δ. Thus γ0 is differentiable at t = 0 with γ̇0 (0) = X(p0 ), as
claimed. Hence γ extends to an integral curve γ
e : (−ρ, T ) → M of X for
some ρ > 0 via γ
e(t) := ϕ(t, p0 ) for −ρ < t ≤ 0 and γ
e(t) := γ(t) for 0 < t < T .
Here ϕ is the flow of X. That γ also extends beyond t = T , follows by replacing γ(t) with γ(T −t) and X with −X. This proves Corollary 2.4.15.

The Group of Diffeomorphisms
Let us denote the space of diffeomorphisms of M by
Diff(M ) := {ϕ : M → M | ϕ is a diffeomorphism} .
This is a group. The group operation is composition and the neutral element
is the identity. Now equation (2.4.5) asserts that the flow of a complete
vector field X ∈ Vect(M ) is a group homomorphism
R → Diff(M ) : t 7→ ϕt .
This homomorphism is smooth and is characterized by the equation
d t
ϕ (p) = X(ϕt (p)),
dt

ϕ0 (p) = p

for all p ∈ M and t ∈ R. We will often abbreviate this equation in the form
d t
ϕ = X ◦ ϕt ,
dt

ϕ0 = id.

(2.4.6)

Exercise 2.4.16 (Isotopy). Let M ⊂ Rk be a compact manifold and I ⊂ R
be an open interval containing 0. Let
I × M → Rk : (t, p) 7→ Xt (p)
be a smooth map such that Xt ∈ Vect(M ) for every t. Prove that there is
a smooth family of diffeomorphisms I × M → M : (t, p) 7→ ϕt (p) satisfying
d
ϕt = Xt ◦ ϕt ,
dt

ϕ0 = id

(2.4.7)

for every t ∈ I. Such a family of diffeomorphisms
I → Diff(M ) : t 7→ ϕt
is called an isotopy of M . Conversely prove that every smooth isotopy
I → Diff(M ) : t 7→ ϕt is generated (uniquely) by a smooth family of vector
fields I → Vect(M ) : t 7→ Xt .

2.4.3

The Lie Bracket

Let M ⊂ Rk and N ⊂ Rℓ be smooth m-manifolds and X ∈ Vect(M ) be
smooth vector field on M . If ψ : N → M is a diffeomorphism, then the
pullback of X under ψ is the vector field on N defined by
(ψ ∗ X)(q) := dψ(q)−1 X(ψ(q))

(2.4.8)

for q ∈ N . If ϕ : M → N is a diffeomorphism, then the pushforward of X
under ϕ is the vector field on N defined by
(ϕ∗ X)(q) := dϕ(ϕ−1 (q))X(ϕ−1 (q))

(2.4.9)

for q ∈ N .
Lemma 2.4.17. Let M ⊂ Rk , N ⊂ Rℓ , and P ⊂ Rn be smooth m-dimensional submanifolds, let ϕ : M → N and ψ : N → P be diffeomorphisms,
and let X ∈ Vect(M ) and Z ∈ Vect(P ). Then
ϕ∗ X = (ϕ−1 )∗ X

(2.4.10)

and
(ψ ◦ ϕ)∗ X = ψ∗ ϕ∗ X,

(ψ ◦ ϕ)∗ Z = ϕ∗ ψ ∗ Z.

(2.4.11)

Proof. Equation (2.4.10) follows from the fact that
dϕ−1 (q) = dϕ(ϕ−1 (q))−1 : Tq N → Tϕ−1 (q) M
for all q ∈ N (Corollary 2.2.15) and the equations in (2.4.11) follow directly
from the chain rule (Theorem 2.2.14). This proves Lemma 2.4.17.
We think of a vector field on M as a smooth map
X : M → Rk
that satisfies the condition X(p) ∈ Tp M for every p ∈ M . Ignoring this
condition temporarily, we can differentiate X as a map from M to Rk and
its derivative at p is then a linear map
dX(p) : Tp M → Rk .
In general, this derivative will not take values in the tangent space Tp M .
However, if we have two vector fields X and Y on M , then the next lemma
shows that the difference of the derivative of X in the direction Y and of Y
in the direction X does take values in the tangent spaces of M .

Lemma 2.4.18 (Lie bracket). Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold and
let X, Y ∈ Vect(M ) be complete vector fields. Denote by

R → Diff(M ) : t 7→ ψ t

the flows of X and Y , respectively. Fix a point p ∈ M and define the smooth
map γ : R → M by
γ(t) := ϕt ◦ ψ t ◦ ϕ−t ◦ ψ −t (p).

Definition 2.4.20 (Lie bracket). Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth manifold and
let X, Y ∈ Vect(M ) be smooth vector fields on M . The Lie bracket of X
and Y is the vector field [X, Y ] ∈ Vect(M ) defined by
[X, Y ](p) := dX(p)Y (p) − dY (p)X(p).

(2.4.17)

Warning: In the literature on differential geometry the Lie bracket of two
vector fields is often (but not always) defined with the opposite sign. The
rationale behind the present choice of the sign will be explained in §2.5.7.
Lemma 2.4.21. Let M ⊂ Rk and N ⊂ Rℓ be smooth manifolds, let X, Y, Z
be smooth vector fields on M , and let
ϕ:N →M
be a diffeomorphism. Then
ϕ∗ [X, Y ] = [ϕ∗ X, ϕ∗ Y ],

(2.4.18)

[X, Y ] + [Y, X] = 0,

(2.4.19)

[X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z, X]] + [Z, [X, Y ]] = 0.

(2.4.20)

The last equation is called the Jacobi identity.
Proof. Let R → Diff(M ) : t 7→ ψ t be the flow of Y . Then the map
R → Diff(N ) : t 7→ ϕ−1 ◦ ψ t ◦ ϕ
is the flow of the vector field ϕ∗ Y on N . Hence, by Lemma 2.4.17 and

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Definition 2.4.22. A Lie algebra is a real vector space g equipped with
a skew-symmetric bilinear map g × g → g : (ξ, η) 7→ [ξ, η] that satisfies the
Jacobi identity [ξ, [η, ζ]] + [η, [ζ, ξ]] + [ζ, [ξ, η]] = 0 for all ξ, η, ζ ∈ g.
Example 2.4.23. The Vector fields on a smooth manifold M ⊂ Rk form a
Lie algebra with the Lie bracket (2.4.17). The space gl(n, R) = Rn×n of real
n × n-matrices is a Lie algebra with the Lie bracket
[ξ, η] := ξη − ηξ.
It is also interesting to consider subspaces of gl(n, R) that are invariant under
this Lie bracket. An example is the space
o
n
o(n) := ξ ∈ gl(n, R) ξ T + ξ = 0
of skew-symmetric n × n-matrices. It is a nontrivial fact that every finitedimensional Lie algebra is isomorphic to a Lie subalgebra of gl(n, R) for
some n. For example, the cross product defines a Lie algebra structure
on R3 and the resulting Lie algebra is isomorphic to o(3).
Remark 2.4.24. There is a linear map Rm×m → Vect(Rm ) : ξ 7→ Xξ which
assigns to a matrix ξ ∈ gl(m, R) the linear vector field Xξ : Rm → Rm
given by Xξ (x) := ξx for x ∈ Rm . This map preserves the Lie bracket,
i.e. [Xξ , Xη ] = X[ξ,η] , and hence is a Lie algebra homomorphism.
To understand the Lie bracket geometrically, consider again the curve
γ(t) := ϕt ◦ ψ t ◦ ϕ−t ◦ ψ −t (p)
in Lemma 2.4.18, where ϕt and ψ t are the flows of the vector fields X and Y ,
respectively. Since γ̇(0) = 0, Exercise 2.4.19 asserts that

Geometrically this means that by following first the backward flow of Y
for time ε, then the backward flow of X for time ε, then the forward flow
of Y for time ε, and finally the forward flow of X for time ε, we will not, in
general, get back to the original point p where we started but approximately
obtain an “error” ε2 [X, Y ](p). An example of this (which we learned from
Donaldson) is the mathematical formulation of parking a car.

2.4. VECTOR FIELDS AND FLOWS

51

Example 2.4.25 (Parking a car). The configuration space for driving a
car in the plane is the manifold M := C × S 1 , where S 1 ⊂ C denotes the
unit circle. Thus a point in M is a pair p = (z, λ) ∈ C × C with |λ| = 1. The
point z ∈ C represents the position of the car and the unit vector λ ∈ S 1
represents the direction in which it is pointing. The left turn is represented
by a vector field X and the right turn by a vector field Y on M . These
vector field are given by X(z, λ) := (λ, iλ) and Y (z, λ) := (λ, −iλ) . Their
Lie bracket is the vector field [X, Y ](z, λ) = (−2iλ, 0). This vector field
represents a sideways move of the car to the right. And a sideways move
by 2ε2 can be achieved by following a backward right turn for time ε, then
a backward left turn for time ε, then a forward right turn for time ε, and
finally a forward left turn for time ε.
This example can be reformulated by identifying C with R2 via z = x+iy
and representing a point in the unit circle by the angle θ ∈ R/2πZ via
λ = eiθ . In this formulation the manifold is M = R2 × R/2πZ, a point in M
is represented by a triple (x, y, θ) ∈ R3 , the vector fields X and Y are
X(x, y, θ) := (cos(θ), sin(θ), 1) ,

Y (x, y, θ) := (cos(θ), sin(θ), −1) ,

and their Lie bracket is [X, Y ](x, y, θ) = 2(sin(θ), − cos(θ), 0).
Lemma 2.4.26. Let X, Y ∈ Vect(M ) be complete vector fields on a manifold M and ϕt , ψ t ∈ Diff(M ) be the flows of X and Y , respectively. Then
the Lie bracket [X, Y ] vanishes if and only if the flows of X and Y commute,
i.e. ϕs ◦ ψ t = ψ t ◦ ϕs for all s, t ∈ R.
Proof. If the flows of X and Y commute, then the Lie bracket [X, Y ] vanishes
by Lemma 2.4.18. Conversely, suppose that [X, Y ] = 0. Then we have

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Lie Groups

Combining the concept of a group and a manifold, it is interesting to consider
groups which are also manifolds and have the property that the group operation and the inverse define smooth maps. We shall only consider groups
of matrices.

2.5.1

Definition and Examples

Definition 2.5.1 (Lie group). A nonempty subset G ⊂ Rn×n is called a
Lie group iff it is a submanifold of Rn×n and a subgroup of GL(n, R), i.e.
g, h ∈ G

=⇒

gh ∈ G

(where gh denotes the product of the matrices g and h) and
g∈G

=⇒

det(g) ̸= 0 and g −1 ∈ G.

(Since G ̸= ∅ it follows from these conditions that the identity matrix 1l is
an element of G.)
Example 2.5.2. The general linear group G = GL(n, R) is an open subset
of Rn×n and hence is a Lie group. By Exercise 2.1.19 the special linear group

SL(n, R) = g ∈ GL(n, R) det(g) = 1
is a Lie group and, by Example 2.1.20, the special orthogonal group
o
n
SO(n) := g ∈ GL(n, R) g T g = 1l, det(g) = 1
is a Lie group. In fact every orthogonal matrix has determinant ±1 and
so SO(n) is an open subset of O(n) (in the relative topology).
In a similar vein the group GL(n, C) := {g ∈ Cn×n | det(g) ̸= 0} of complex matrices with nonzero (complex) determinant is an open subset of Cn×n
and hence is a Lie group. As in the real case, the subgroups

SL(n, C) := g ∈ GL(n, C) det(g) = 1 ,

U(n) := g ∈ GL(n, C) g ∗ g = 1l ,

SU(n) := g ∈ GL(n, C) g ∗ g = 1l, det(g) = 1
are submanifolds of GL(n, C) and hence are Lie groups. Here g ∗ := ḡ T
denotes the conjugate transpose of a complex matrix.
Exercise 2.5.3. Prove that SL(n, C), U(n), and SU(n) are Lie groups.
Prove that SO(n) is connected and that O(n) has two connected components.

This is the symplectic linear group. Prove that Sp(2n) is a Lie group.
Hint: See [49, Lemma 1.1.12].
Example 2.5.6 (Unit quaternions). The quaternions form a fourdimensional associative unital algebra H, equipped with a basis 1, i, j, k.
The elements of H are vectors of the form
x = x0 + ix1 + jx2 + kx3

x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ∈ R.

(2.5.1)

The product structure is the bilinear map H × H → H : (x, y) 7→ xy, determined by the relations
i2 = j2 = k2 = −1,

ij = −ji = k,

jk = −kj = i,

ki = −ik = j.

This product structure is associative but not commutative. The quaternions
are equipped with an involution H → H : x 7→ x̄, which assigns to a quaternion x of the form (2.5.1) its conjugate x̄ := x0 − ix1 − jx2 − kx3 . This
involution satisfies the conditions
|xy| = |x| |y|
xy = ȳx̄,
xx̄ = |x|2 ,
p
for x, y ∈ H, where |x| := x20 + x22 + x22 + x23 denotes the Euclidean norm
of the quaternion (2.5.1). Thus the unit quaternions form a group

Sp(1) := x ∈ H |x| = 1
x + y = x̄ + ȳ,

with the inverse map x 7→ x̄. Note that the group Sp(1) is diffeomorphic
to the 3-sphere S 3 ⊂ R4 under the isomorphism H ∼
= R4 . Warning: The
unit quaternions (a compact Lie group) are not to be confused with the
symplectic linear group in Exercise 2.5.5 (a noncompact Lie group) despite
the similarity in notation.

54

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS
Let G ⊂ GL(n, R) be a Lie group. Then the maps
G → G : g 7→ g −1

G × G → G : (g, h) 7→ gh,

are smooth (see [64]). Fixing an element h ∈ G we find that the derivative
of the map G → G : g 7→ gh at g ∈ G is given by the linear map
Tg G → Tgh G : gb 7→ gbh.

(2.5.2)

Here gb and h are both matrices in Rn×n and gbh denotes the matrix product. In fact, if gb ∈ Tg G, then, since G is a manifold, there exists a smooth
curve γ : R → G with γ(0) = g and γ̇(0) = gb. Since G is a group we obtain
a smooth curve β : R → G given by β(t) := γ(t)h. It satisfies β(0) = gh and
so gbh = β̇(0) ∈ Tgh G.
The linear map (2.5.2) is obviously a vector space isomorphism whose
inverse is given by right multiplication with h−1 . It is sometimes convenient
to define the map Rh : G → G by
Rh (g) := gh
for g ∈ G (right multiplication by h). This is a diffeomorphism and the linear
map (2.5.2) is the derivative of Rh at g, so
dRh (g)b
g = gbh

for gb ∈ Tg G.

Similarly, each element g ∈ G determines a diffeomorphism Lg : G → G,
given by
Lg (h) := gh
for h ∈ G (left multiplication by g). Its derivative at h ∈ G is again given by
matrix multiplication, i.e. the linear map dLg (h) : Th G → Tgh G is given by
dLg (h)b
h = gb
h

for b
h ∈ Th G.

(2.5.3)

Since Lg is a diffeomorphism its derivative dLg (h) : Th G → Tgh G is again a
vector space isomorphism for every h ∈ G.
Exercise 2.5.7. Prove that the map G → G : g 7→ g −1 is a diffeomorphism
and that its derivative at g ∈ G is the vector space isomorphism
Tg G → Tg−1 G : v 7→ −g −1 vg −1 .
Hint: Use [64] or any textbook on first year analysis.

The Lie Algebra of a Lie Group

Let
G ⊂ GL(n, R)
be a Lie group. Its tangent space at the identity matrix 1l ∈ G is called the
Lie algebra of G and will be denoted by
g = Lie(G) := T1l G.
This terminology is justified by the fact that g is in fact a Lie algebra, i.e.
it is invariant under the standard Lie bracket operation
[ξ, η] := ξη − ηξ
on the space Rn×n of square matrices (see Lemma 2.5.9 below). The proof
requires the notion of the exponential matrix. For ξ ∈ Rn×n and t ∈ R
we define
∞ k k
X
t ξ
exp(tξ) :=
.
(2.5.4)
k!
k=0

A standard result in first year analysis asserts that this series converges
absolutely (and uniformly on compact t-intervals), that the map
R → Rn×n : t 7→ exp(tξ)
is smooth and satisfies the differential equation
d
exp(tξ) = ξ exp(tξ) = exp(tξ)ξ,
dt

(2.5.5)

and that
exp((s + t)ξ) = exp(sξ) exp(tξ),

exp(0ξ) = 1l

(2.5.6)

for all s, t ∈ R. This shows that the matrix exp(tξ) is invertible for each t
and that the map R → GL(n, R) : t 7→ exp(tξ) is a group homomorphism.
Exercise 2.5.8. Prove the following analogue of (2.4.12). For ξ, η ∈ g

In other words, the infinitesimal Lie group commutator is the matrix commutator. (Compare Equations (2.5.7) and (2.4.21).)

56

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Lemma 2.5.9. Let G ⊂ GL(n, R) be a Lie group and denote by g := Lie(G)
its Lie algebra. Then the following holds.
(i) If ξ ∈ g, then exp(tξ) ∈ G for every t ∈ R.
(ii) If g ∈ G and η ∈ g, then gηg −1 ∈ g.
(iii) If ξ, η ∈ g, then [ξ, η] = ξη − ηξ ∈ g.
Proof. We prove (i). For every g ∈ G we have a vector space isomorphism g = T1l G → Tg G : ξ 7→ ξg as in (2.5.2). Hence each element ξ ∈ g
determines a vector field Xξ ∈ Vect(G), defined by
Xξ (g) := ξg ∈ Tg G,

g ∈ G.

(2.5.8)

By Theorem 2.4.7 there is an integral curve γ : (−ε, ε) → G satisfying
γ̇(t) = Xξ (γ(t)) = ξγ(t),

γ(0) = 1l.

By (2.5.5), the curve (−ε, ε) → Rn×n : t 7→ exp(tξ) satisfies the same initial
value problem and hence, by uniqueness, we have exp(tξ) = γ(t) ∈ G for
all t ∈ R with |t| < ε. Now let t ∈ R and choose N ∈ N such that Nt < ε.
Then exp( Nt ξ) ∈ G and hence it follows from (2.5.6) that

exp(tξ) = exp

t
ξ
N

N
∈ G.

This proves (i).
We prove (ii). Consider the smooth curve γ : R → Rn×n defined by
γ(t) := g exp(tη)g −1 .
By (i) we have γ(t) ∈ G for every t ∈ R. Since γ(0) = 1l we have
gηg −1 = γ̇(0) ∈ g.
This proves (ii).
We prove (iii). Define the smooth map η : R → Rn×n by
η(t) := exp(tξ)η exp(−tξ).
By (i) we have exp(tξ) ∈ G and, by (ii), we have η(t) ∈ g for every t ∈ R.
Hence [ξ, η] = η̇(0) ∈ g. This proves (iii) and Lemma 2.5.9.
By Lemma 2.5.9 the curve γ : R → G defined by γ(t) := exp(tξ)g is the
integral curve of the vector field Xξ in (2.5.8) with initial condition γ(0) = g.
Thus Xξ is complete for every ξ ∈ g.

2.5. LIE GROUPS

57

Lemma 2.5.10. If ξ ∈ g and γ : R → G is a smooth curve satisfying
γ(s + t) = γ(s)γ(t),

γ(0) = 1l,

γ̇(0) = ξ,

(2.5.9)

then γ(t) = exp(tξ) for every t ∈ R.
Proof. For every t ∈ R we have
γ̇(t) =

d
d
γ(s + t) =
γ(s)γ(t) = γ̇(0)γ(t) = ξγ(t).
ds s=0
ds s=0

Hence γ is the integral curve of the vector field Xξ in (2.5.8) with γ(0) = 1l.
This implies γ(t) = exp(tξ) for every t ∈ R, as claimed.
Example 2.5.11. Since the general linear group GL(n, R) is an open subset
of Rn×n its Lie algebra is the space of all real n × n-matrices
gl(n, R) := Lie(GL(n, R)) = Rn×n .
The Lie algebra of the special linear group is

sl(n, R) := Lie(SL(n, R)) = ξ ∈ gl(n, R) trace(ξ) = 0
(see Exercise 2.2.9) and the Lie algebra of the special orthogonal group is
o
n
so(n) := Lie(SO(n)) = ξ ∈ gl(n, R) ξ T + ξ = 0 = o(n)
(see Example 2.2.10).
Exercise 2.5.12. Prove that the Lie algebras of the general linear group
over C, the special linear group over C, the unitary group, and the special
unitary group are given by
gl(n, C) := Lie(GL(n, C)) = Cn×n ,

sl(n, C) := Lie(SL(n, C)) = ξ ∈ gl(n, C) trace(ξ) = 0 ,

u(n) := Lie(U(n)) = ξ ∈ gl(n, R) ξ ∗ + ξ = 0 ,

su(n) := Lie(SU(n)) = ξ ∈ gl(n, C) ξ ∗ + ξ = 0, trace(ξ) = 0 .
These are vector spaces over the reals. Determine their real dimensions.
Which of these are also complex vector spaces?
Remark 2.5.13. Let G ⊂ GL(n, R) be a subgroup. In Theorem 2.5.27
below it is shown that G is a Lie group if and only if it is a closed subset
of GL(n, R) in the relative topology. This observation can be used in many
of the examples and exercises of the present section.

2.5.3

Lie Group Homomorphisms

Let G, H be Lie groups and g, h be Lie algebras. A Lie group homomorphism from G to H is a smooth map ρ : G → H that is a group
homomorphism. A Lie group isomorphism is a bijective Lie group homomorphism whose inverse is also a Lie group homomorphism. A Lie group
automorphism is a Lie group isomorphism from a Lie group to itself. A
Lie algebra homomorphism from g to h is a linear map Φ : g → h that
preserves the Lie bracket. A Lie algebra isomorphism is a bijective Lie
algebra homomorphism whose inverse is also a Lie algebra homomorphism.
A Lie algebra automorphism is a Lie algebra isomorphism from a Lie
algebra to itself.
Lemma 2.5.16. Let G and H be Lie groups and denote their Lie algebras
by g := Lie(G) and h := Lie(H). Let ρ : G → H be a Lie group homomorphism and denote its derivative at 1l ∈ G by
ρ̇ := dρ(1l) : g → h.
Then ρ̇ is a Lie algebra homomorphism. Moreover,
ρ(exp(ξ)) = exp(ρ̇(ξ)),
for all ξ ∈ g and all g ∈ G.

ρ(gξg −1 ) = ρ(g)ρ̇(ξ)ρ(g)−1

2.5. LIE GROUPS

59

Proof. The proof has three steps.
Step 1. For all ξ ∈ g and t ∈ R we have ρ(exp(tξ)) = exp(tρ̇(ξ)).
Fix an element ξ ∈ g. Then exp(tξ) ∈ G for every t ∈ R by Lemma 2.5.9.
Thus we can define a curve γ : R → H by γ(t) := ρ(exp(tξ)). Since ρ is
smooth, this is a smooth curve in H and, since ρ is a group homomorphism
and the exponential map satisfies (2.5.6), our curve γ satisfies the conditions
γ(s + t) = γ(s)γ(t),

γ(0) = 1l,

γ̇(0) = dρ(1l)ξ = ρ̇(ξ).

Hence γ(t) = exp(tρ̇(ξ)) by Lemma 2.5.10. This proves Step 1.
Step 2. For all g ∈ G and η ∈ g we have ρ̇(gηg −1 ) = ρ(g)ρ̇(η)ρ(g)−1 .
Define the smooth curve γ : R → G by γ(t) := g exp(tη)g −1 . It takes values
in G by Lemma 2.5.9. By Step 1 we have
ρ(γ(t)) = ρ(g)ρ(exp(tη))ρ(g)−1 = ρ(g) exp(tρ̇(η))ρ(g)−1
for every t. Since γ(0) = 1l and γ̇(0) = gηg −1 we obtain
ρ̇(gηg −1 ) = dρ(γ(0))γ̇(0)

ρ(γ(t))
dt t=0
d
ρ(g) exp(tρ̇(η))ρ(g)−1
=
dt t=0
=

= ρ(g)ρ̇(η)ρ(g)−1 .
This proves Step 2.
Step 3. For all ξ, η ∈ g we have ρ̇([ξ, η]) = [ρ̇(ξ), ρ̇(η)].
Define the curve η : R → g by η(t) := exp(tξ)η exp(−tξ) for t ∈ R. It takes
values in the Lie algebra of G by Lemma 2.5.9 and η̇(0) = [ξ, η]. Hence
d
ρ̇ (exp(tξ)η exp(−tξ))

d
=
ρ (exp(tξ)) ρ̇(η)ρ (exp(−tξ))
dt t=0
d
=
exp (tρ̇(ξ)) ρ̇(η) exp (−tρ̇(ξ))
dt t=0

ρ̇([ξ, η]) =

= [ρ̇(ξ), ρ̇(η)] .
Here the first equality follows from the fact that ρ̇ is linear, the second
equality follows from Step 2 with g = exp(tξ), and the third equality follows
from Step 1. This proves Step 3 and Lemma 2.5.16.

Exercise 2.5.19. If ρ : G → H is a bijective Lie group homomorphism,

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Closed Subgroups

This section deals with subgroups of a Lie group G that are also submanifolds
of G. Such subgroups are called Lie subgroups. We assume throughout
that G ⊂ GL(n, R) is a Lie group with the Lie algebra g := Lie(G) = T1l G.
Definition 2.5.26 (Lie subgroup). A subset H ⊂ G is called a Lie subgroup of G iff it is both a subgroup and a smooth submanifold of G.
A useful general criterion is the Closed Subgroup Theorem which asserts
that a subgroup H ⊂ G is a Lie subgroup if and only if it is a closed subset
of G. This was first proved in 1929 by John von Neumann [54] for the special
case G = GL(n, R) and then in 1930 by Élie Cartan [15] in full generality.
Theorem 2.5.27 (Closed Subgroup Theorem). Let H be a subgroup
of G. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) H is a smooth submanifold (and hence a Lie subgroup) of G.
(ii) H is a closed subset of G.
It (i) holds, then the Lie algebra of H is the space

h := η ∈ g exp(tη) ∈ H for all t ∈ R .

(2.5.17)

Proof of Theorem 2.5.27 (i) =⇒ (ii) and (2.5.17). Assume that H is a Lie
subgroup of G and let h ⊂ g be defined by (2.5.17). We prove that h is
the Lie algebra of H. Assume first that η ∈ h. Then the curve γ : R → G
defined by γ(t) := exp(tη) for t ∈ R takes values in H and satisfies γ(0) = 1l
and γ̇(0) = η, and this implies η ∈ T1l H = Lie(H). Conversely, if η ∈ Lie(H),
then Lemma 2.5.9 asserts that exp(tη) ∈ H for all t ∈ R and hence η ∈ h.
This shows that h = Lie(H).
Next we prove in three steps that H is a closed subset of G. Choose any
inner product on g, denote by |·| the associated norm, and denote by h⊥ ⊂ g
the orthogonal complement of h with respect to this inner product.
Step 1. There exist open neighborhoods V ⊂ H of 1l and W ⊂ h⊥ of the
origin such that the map ϕ : V × W → G, defined by
ϕ(h, ξ) := h exp(ξ)
for h ∈ V and ξ ∈ W , is a diffeomorphism from V × W onto an open neighborhood U = ϕ(V × W ) ⊂ G of 1l.
The derivative of the map H × h⊥ → G : (h, ξ) 7→ h exp(ξ) at the point (1l, 0)
is bijective. Hence Step 1 follows from the Inverse Function Theorem.

Step 2. There exists a δ > 0 such that, if ξ, ξ ′ ∈ h⊥ satisfy |ξ|, |ξ ′ | < δ
and exp(ξ ′ ) exp(−ξ) ∈ H, then ξ = ξ ′ .
Let V, W, ϕ be as in Step 1, choose an open neigborhood V ′ ⊂ G of 1l such
that V ′ ∩ H = V , and choose a constant δ > 0 such that the following holds.
(a) If ξ ∈ h⊥ satisfies |ξ| < δ, then ξ ∈ W .
(b) If ξ, ξ ′ ∈ g satisfy |ξ|, |ξ ′ | < δ, then exp(ξ ′ ) exp(−ξ) ∈ V ′ .
Let ξ, ξ ′ ∈ h⊥ such that |ξ|, |ξ ′ | < δ and h := exp(ξ ′ ) exp(−ξ) ∈ H. Then we
have ξ, ξ ′ ∈ W by (a) and h ∈ V ′ ∩ H = V by (b). Also ϕ(h, ξ) = ϕ(1l, ξ ′ )
and so ξ = ξ ′ , because ϕ is injective on V × W . This proves Step 2.
Step 3. Let hi be a sequence in H that converges to an element g ∈ G.
Then g ∈ H.
Let ϕ : V × W → U be as in Step 1 and let δ > 0 be as in Step 2. Since the
−1
sequence h−1
i g converges to 1l, there exists an i0 ∈ N such that hi g ∈ U for
all i ≥ i0 . Hence, for each i ≥ i0 , there exists a unique pair (h′i , ξi ) ∈ V × W
′
such that h−1
i g = hi exp(ξi ). This sequence satisfies limi→∞ ξi = 0. Hence
there exists an integer i1 ≥ i0 such that |ξi | < δ for all i ≥ i1 . Since
hi h′i exp(ξi ) = g = hj h′j exp(ξj ),
we also have exp(ξi ) exp(−ξj ) = (hi h′i )−1 hj h′j ∈ H for all i, j ≥ i1 . By Step 3,
this implies ξi = ξj for all i, j ≥ i1 . Hence ξi = limj→∞ ξj = 0 for all i ≥ i1
and so g = hi h′i ∈ H. This proves Step 3.
By Step 3 the Lie subgroup H is a closed subset of G. Thus we have
proved that (i) implies (ii) and (2.5.17) in Theorem 2.5.27.
The proof of the converse implication requires three preparatory lemmas.
Lemma 2.5.28. Let ξ ∈ g and let γ : R → G be a curve that is differentiable
at t = 0 and satisfies γ(0) = 1l and γ̇(0) = ξ. Then
exp(tξ) = lim γ(t/k)k

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Lemma 2.5.29. Let H ⊂ G be a closed subgroup. Then the set h in (2.5.17)
is a Lie subalgebra of g
Proof. Let ξ, η ∈ h and define the curve γ : R → H by
γ(t) := exp(tξ) exp(tη)
for t ∈ R. This curve is smooth and satisfies γ(0) = 1l and γ̇(0) = ξ + η.
Since H is closed, it follows from Lemma 2.5.28 that
exp(t(ξ + η)) = lim γ(t/k)k ∈ H
k→∞

for all t ∈ R and so ξ + η ∈ h by definition. Thus h is a linear subspace of g.
Now fix an element ξ ∈ h. If h ∈ H, then
exp(sh−1 ξh) = h−1 exp(sξ)h ∈ H
for all s ∈ R and hence h−1 ξh ∈ h by definition. Take h = exp(tη) with η ∈ h
to obtain exp(−tη)ξ exp(tη) ∈ h for all t ∈ R. Differentiating this curve
at t = 0 gives [ξ, η] ∈ h and this proves Lemma 2.5.29.
Lemma 2.5.30. Let H ⊂ G be a closed subgroup and let h ⊂ g be the Lie
subalgebra in (2.5.17). Let ξ ∈ g, let (ξi )i∈N be a sequence in g, and let (τi )i∈N
be a sequence of positive real numbers such that
exp(ξi ) ∈ H,

ξi ̸= 0

for all i ∈ N and
lim τi = 0,

i→∞

lim ξi = 0,

lim

Then ξ ∈ h.
Proof. Fix a real number t. Then, for each i ∈ N, there exists a unique
integer mi ∈ Z such that mi τi ≤ t < (mi + 1)τi . The sequence mi satisfies
lim mi τi = t,

i→∞

lim mi ξi = lim mi τi

i→∞

ξi

and hence
exp(tξ) = lim exp(mi ξi ) = lim exp(ξi )mi ∈ H.

Thus exp(tξ) ∈ H for every t ∈ R and so ξ ∈ h by (2.5.17). This proves
Lemma 2.5.30.

2.5. LIE GROUPS

Proof of Theorem 2.5.27 (ii) =⇒ (i). Choose any inner product on g. Let
H ⊂ G be a closed subgroup of G and define the set h ⊂ g by (2.5.17).
Then h is a Lie subalgebra of g by Lemma 2.5.29. Define
k := dim(h),

ℓ := dim(g) ≥ k,

and choose a basis η1 , . . . , ηℓ of g such that the vectors η1 . . . . , ηk form a basis
of h and ην ∈ h⊥ for ν > k. Let h0 ∈ H and define the map Θ : Rℓ → G by
Θ(t1 , . . . , tℓ ) := h0 exp(t1 η1 + · · · + tk ηk ) exp(tk+1 ηk+1 + · · · + tℓ ηℓ ).
Then Θ(0) = h0 , Θ(Rk × {0}) ⊂ H, and the derivative dΘ(0) : Rℓ → Th0 G
is bijective. Hence the inverse function theorem asserts that Θ restricts to a
diffeomorphism from an open neighborhood Ω ⊂ Rℓ of the origin to an open
neighborhood U := Θ(Ω) ⊂ G of h0 that satisfies

Θ(0) = h0 ,
Θ Ω ∩ (Rk × {0}) ⊂ U ∩ H.
We prove the following.
Claim. There exists an open set Ω0 ⊂ Rℓ such that

0 ∈ Ω0 ⊂ Ω,
Θ Ω0 ∩ (Rk × {0}) = U0 ∩ H,
U0 := Θ(Ω0 ). (2.5.19)
Assume, by contradiction, that such an open set Ω0 does not exist. Then
there exists a sequence ti = (t1i , . . . , tℓi ) ∈ Rℓ such that
lim ti = 0,

i→∞

ti ∈ Ω \ (Rk × {0}),

Θ(ti ) ∈ H.

Define
hi := h0 exp

k
X

tνi ην

ν=1

ξi :=

tνi ην ∈ h⊥ \ {0}.

Then hi exp(ξi ) = Θ(ti ) ∈ H and hence
lim ξi = 0,

i→∞

ξi ̸= 0,

exp(ξi ) = h−1
i Θ(ti ) ∈ H.

Passing to a subsequence, if necessary, we may assume that the sequence
ξi /|ξi | converges. Denote its limit by ξ := limi→∞ ξi /|ξi |. Then ξ ∈ h by
Lemma 2.5.30 and ξ ∈ h⊥ by definition. Since |ξ| = 1, this is a contradiction.
This contradiction proves the Claim. Thus there does, after all, exist an
open set Ω0 ⊂ Rℓ that satisfies (2.5.19), and the map Θ−1 : U0 → Ω0 is then
a coordinate chart on G which satisfies Θ−1 (U0 ∩ H) = Ω0 ∩ (Rk × {0}).
Hence H is a submanifold of G and this proves Theorem 2.5.27.

Lie Groups and Diffeomorphisms

There is a natural correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras on
the one hand and diffeomorphisms and vector fields on the other hand. We
summarize this correspondence in the following table.
Lie groups
G ⊂ GL(n, R)
g = Lie(G) = T1l G
exponential map
t 7→ exp(tξ)
adjoint representation
ξ 7→ gξg −1
Lie bracket on g
[ξ, η] = ξη − ηξ

Diffeomorphisms
Diff(M )
Vect(M ) = Tid Diff(M )
flow of a vector field
t 7→ ϕt = “ exp(tX)′′
pushforward
X 7→ ϕ∗ X
Lie bracket of vector fields
[X, Y ] = dX · Y − dY · X

To understand the correspondence between the exponential map and the
flow of a vector field compare equation (2.4.6) with equation (2.5.5). To understand the correspondence between the adjoint representation and pushforward observe that
d
d
ϕ∗ Y =
ϕ ◦ ψ t ◦ ϕ−1 ,
gηg −1 =
g exp(tη)g −1 ,
dt t=0
dt t=0
where ψ t denotes the flow of Y . To understand the correspondence between
the Lie brackets recall that
d
d
[X, Y ] =
(ϕt )∗ Y,
[ξ, η] =
exp(tξ)η exp(−tξ),
dt t=0
dt t=0
where ϕt denotes the flow of X. We emphasize that the analogy between
Lie groups and Diffeomorphisms only works well when the manifold M is
compact so that every vector field on M is complete. The next exercise gives
another parallel between the Lie bracket on the Lie algebra of a Lie group
and the Lie bracket of two vector fields.
Exercise 2.5.38. Let G ⊂ GL(n, R) be a Lie group with Lie algebra g and
let ξ, η ∈ g. Define the smooth curve γ : R → G by
γ(t) := exp(tξ) exp(tη) exp(−tξ) exp(−tη).
Show that γ̇(0) = 0 and 21 γ̈(0) = [ξ, η] (cf. Exercise 2.5.8 and Lemma 2.4.18).
Exercise 2.5.39. Let G ⊂ GL(n, R) be a Lie group with Lie algebra g and
let ξ, η ∈ g. Show that [ξ, η] = 0 if and only if the exponential maps commute, i.e. exp(sξ) exp(tη) = exp(tη) exp(sξ) = exp(sξ + tη) for all s, t ∈ R.
How can this observation be deduced from Lemma 2.4.26?

68

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Definition 2.5.40. Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth manifold and let G ⊂ GL(n, R)
be a Lie group. A (smooth) group action of G on M is a smooth map
G × M → M : (g, p) 7→ ϕg (p)

(2.5.23)

that for each pair g, h ∈ G satisfies the condition
ϕg ◦ ϕh = ϕgh ,

ϕ1l = id.

(2.5.24)

If (2.5.23) is a smooth group action, then the infinitesimal action of the
Lie algebra g := Lie(G) on M is the map g → Vect(M ) : ξ 7→ Xξ defined by
Xξ (p) :=

d
ϕ
(p)
dt t=0 exp(yξ)

(2.5.25)

for ξ ∈ g and p ∈ M .
Exercise 2.5.41. Let (2.5.23) be a smooth group action of a Lie group G
on a manifold M . Prove that
Xg−1 ξg = ϕ∗g Xξ ,

X[ξ,η] = [Xξ , Xη ]

(2.5.26)

for all g ∈ G and all ξ, η ∈ g = Lie(G).
Exercise 2.5.42. Show that the maps GL(m, R) × Rm → Rm : (gx) 7→ gx,
SO(m + 1) × S m → S m : (g, x) 7→ gx, and R × S 1 → S 1 : (θ, z) 7→ eiθ z are
smooth group actions. Verify the formulas in (2.5.26) in these examples.
A smooth group action of a Lie group G on a manifold M can the thought
of as a “Lie group homomorphism”
G → Diff(M ) : g 7→ ϕg .

(2.5.27)

While the group Diff(M ) is infinite-dimensional, and so cannot cannot be a
Lie group in the formal sense, it has many properties in common with Lie
groups as explained above. For example, one can define what is meant by a
smooth path in Diff(M ) and extend formally the notion of a tangent vector
(as the derivative of a path through a given element of Diff(M )) to this
setting. In particular, the tangent space of Diff(M ) at the identity can then
be identified with the space of vector fields Tid Diff(M ) = Vect(M ), and the
infinitesimal action in (2.5.25) is the Lie algebra homomorphism associated
to the “Lie group homomorphism” (2.5.27). In fact, we have chosen the sign
in the definition of the Lie bracket of vector fields so that the map ξ 7→ Xξ
is a Lie algebra homomorphism and not a Lie algebra anti-homomorphism.
This will be discussed further in §2.5.7.

Smooth Maps and Algebra Homomorphisms

Let M be a smooth submanifold of Rk . Denote by F (M ) := C ∞ (M, R)
the space of smooth real valued functions f : M → R. Then F (M ) is a
commutative unital algebra. Each p ∈ M determines a unital algebra homomorphism εp : F (M ) → R defined by εp (f ) = f (p) for p ∈ M .
Theorem 2.5.43. Every unital algebra homomorphism ε : F (M ) → R has
the form ε = εp for some p ∈ M .
Proof. Assume that ε : F (M ) → R is an algebra homomorphism.
Claim. For all f, g ∈ F (M ) we have ε(g) = 0 =⇒ ε(f ) ∈ f (g −1 (0)).
Indeed, the function f − ε(f ) · 1 lies in the kernel of ε and so the function h := (f − ε(f ) · 1)2 + g 2 also lies in the kernel of ε. There must be at
least one point p ∈ M where h(p) = 0 for otherwise 1 = ε(h)ε(1/h) = 0.
For this point p we have f (p) = ε(f ) and g(p) = 0, hence p ∈ g −1 (0), and
therefore ε(f ) = f (p) ∈ f (g −1 (0)). This proves the claim.
The theorem asserts that there exists a p ∈ M such that every f ∈ F (M )
satisfies ε(f ) = f (p). Assume, by contradiction, that this is false. Then for
every p ∈ M there exists a function f ∈ F (M ) such that f (p) ̸= ε(f ). Replace f by f − ε(f ) to obtain f (p) ̸= 0 = ε(f ). Now use the axiom of choice
to obtain a family of functions fp ∈ F (M ), one for every p ∈ M , such
that fp (p) ̸= 0 = ε(fp ) for all p ∈ M . Then the set Up := fp−1 (R \ {0}) is
an M -open neighborhood of p for every p ∈ M . Choose a sequence of
S compact sets Kn ⊂ M such that Kn ⊂ intM (Kn+1 ) for all n and M
=
n Kn .
P
Then, for each n, there is a gn ∈ F (M ) (a finite sum of the form i fp2i ) such
that ε(gn ) = 0 and gn (q) > 0 for all q ∈ Kn . If M is compact, this is already
a contradiction because a positive function cannot belong to the kernel of ε.
Otherwise, choose f ∈ F (M ) such that f (q) ≥ n for all q ∈ M \ Kn and
all n ∈ N. Then ε(f ) ∈ f (gn−1 (0)) ⊂ f (M \ Kn ) ⊂ [n, ∞) by the claim and
so ε(f ) ≥ n for all n. This is a contradiction and proves Theorem 2.5.43.
Now let N be another smooth submanifold (say of Rℓ ) and let C ∞ (M, N )
denote the space of smooth maps from M to N . A homomorphism from
F (N ) to F (M ) is a (real) linear map Φ : F (N ) → F (M ) that satisfies
Φ(f g) = Φ(f )Φ(g),

Φ(1) = 1.

Let Hom(F (N ), F (M )) denote the space of homomorphisms from F (N )
to F (M ). An automorphism of the algebra F (M ) is a bijective homomorphism Φ : F (M ) → F (M ). The automorphisms of F (M ) form a group
denoted by Aut(F (M )).

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Corollary 2.5.44. The pullback operation
C ∞ (M, N ) → Hom(F (N ), F (M )) : ϕ 7→ ϕ∗
is bijective. In particular, the map Diff(M ) → Aut(F (M )) : ϕ 7→ ϕ∗ is an
anti-isomorphism of groups.
Proof. This is an exercise with hint. Let Φ : F (N ) → F (M ) be a unital
algebra homomorphism. By Theorem 2.5.43 there exists a map ϕ : M → N
such that εp ◦ Φ = εϕ(p) for all p ∈ M . Prove that f ◦ ϕ : M → R is smooth
for every smooth map f : N → R and deduce that ϕ is smooth.
Remark 2.5.45. The pullback operation is functorial, i.e.
(ψ ◦ ϕ)∗ = ϕ∗ ◦ ψ ∗ ,

id∗M = idF (M ) .

for ϕ ∈ C ∞ (M, N ) and ψ ∈ C ∞ (N, P ). Here id denotes the identity map
of the space indicated in the subscript. Hence Corollary 2.5.44 may be
summarized by saying that the category of smooth manifolds and smooth
maps is anti-isomorphic to a subcategory of the category of commutative
unital algebras and unital algebra homomorphisms.
Exercise 2.5.46. If M is compact, then there is a slightly different way to
prove Theorem 2.5.43. An ideal in F (M ) is a linear subspace J ⊂ F (M )
satisfying the condition f ∈ F (M ), g ∈ J =⇒ f g ∈ J . A maximal
ideal in F (M ) is an ideal J ⊊ F (M ) such that every ideal J ′ ⊊ F (M )
containing J is equal to J . Prove that, if M is compact and J ⊂ F (M )
is an ideal with the property that for every p ∈ M there is an f ∈ J
with f (p) ̸= 0, then J = F (M ). Deduce that each maximal ideal in F (M )
has the form Jp := {f ∈ F (M ) | f (p) = 0} for some p ∈ M .
Exercise 2.5.47. If M is compact, give another proof of Corollary 2.5.44
as follows. The set Φ−1 (Jp ) is a maximal ideal in F (N ) for each p ∈ M .
Use Exercise 2.5.46 to deduce that there is a unique map ϕ : M → N such
that Φ−1 (Jp ) = Jϕ(p) for all p ∈ M . Show that ϕ is smooth and ϕ∗ = Φ.
Exercise 2.5.48. It is a theorem of ring theory that, when I ⊂ R is an ideal
in a ring R, the quotient ring R/I is a field if and only if the ideal I is maximal. Show that the kernel of the ring homomorphism εp : F (M ) → R of
Theorem 2.5.43 is the ideal Jp of Exercise 2.5.46. Conclude that M is compact if and only if every maximal ideal J in F (M ) is of the form J = Jp
for some p ∈ M . Hint: The functions of compact support form an ideal. It
can be shown that if M is not compact and J is a maximal ideal containing all functions of compact support, then the quotient field F (M )/J is a
non-Archimedean ordered field which properly contains R.

Vector Fields and Derivations

A derivation of F (M ) is a linear map δ : F (M ) → F (M ) that satisfies
δ(f g) = δ(f )g + f δ(g).
and the derivations form a Lie algebra denoted by Der(F (M )). We may
think of Der(F (M )) as the Lie algebra of Aut(F (M )) with the Lie bracket
given by the commutator. By Theorem 2.5.43 the pullback operation
Diff(M ) → Aut(F (M )) : ϕ 7→ ϕ∗

(2.5.28)

can be thought of as a Lie group anti-isomorphism. Differentiating it at the
identity ϕ = id gives a linear map
Vect(M ) → Der(F (M )) : X 7→ LX .

(2.5.29)

Here the operator LX : F (M ) → F (M ) is given by the derivative of a
function f in the direction of the vector field X, i.e.
LX f := df · X =

d
f ◦ ϕt ,
dt t=0

where ϕt denotes the flow of X. Since the map (2.5.29) is the derivative
of the “Lie group” anti-homomorphism (2.5.28) we expect it to be a Lie
algebra anti-homomorphism. Indeed, one can show that
L[X,Y ] = LY LX − LX LY = −[LX , LY ]

(2.5.30)

for X, Y ∈ Vect(M ). This confirms that our sign in the definition of the Lie
bracket in §2.4.3 is consistent with the standard conventions in the theory
of Lie groups. In the literature the difference between a vector field and the
associated derivation LX is sometimes neglected in the notation and many
authors write Xf := df · X = LX f , thus thinking of a vector field on a
manifold M as an operator on the space of functions. With this notation one
obtains the equation [X, Y ]f = Y (Xf ) − X(Y f ) and here lies the origin for
the use of the opposite sign for the Lie bracket in many books on differential
geometry.
Exercise 2.5.49. Prove that the map (2.5.29) is bijective. Hint: Fix a
derivation δ ∈ Der(F (M )) and prove the following. Fact 1: If U ⊂ M is
an open set and f ∈ F (M ) vanishes on U , then δ(f ) vanishes on U . Fact 2:
If p ∈ M and the derivative df (p) : Tp M → R is zero, then (δ(f ))(p) = 0.
(By Fact 1, the proof of Fact 2 can be reduced to an argument in local
coordinates.)
Exercise 2.5.50. Verify the formula (2.5.30).

This section characterizes submersions (§2.6.1) and introduces the concept
of a smooth vector bundle in the extrinsic setting (§2.6.2).

2.6.1

Submersions

Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold and N ⊂ Rℓ be a smooth n-manifold.
A smooth map f : N → M is called a submersion iff its derivative
df (q) : Tq N → Tf (q) M
is surjective for every q ∈ N .

Lemma 2.6.1. Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold, N ⊂ Rℓ be a smooth
n-manifold, and f : N → M be a smooth map. The following are equivalent.
(i) f is a submersion.
(ii) For every q0 ∈ N there is an M -open neighborhood U of p0 := f (q0 ) and
a smooth map g : U → N such that g(f (q0 )) = q0 and f ◦ g = id : U → U .
Thus f has a local right inverse near every point in N (see Figure 2.12).
Proof. We prove that (i) implies (ii). Since the derivative
df (q0 ) : Tq0 N → Tp0 M
is surjective we have n ≥ m and
dim ker df (q0 ) = n − m.
Hence there is a linear map A : Rℓ → Rn−m whose restriction to the kernel
of df (q0 ) is bijective. Now define the map ψ : N → M × Rn−m by
ψ(q) := (f (q), A(q − q0 ))

2.6. VECTOR BUNDLES AND SUBMERSIONS

73

for q ∈ N . Then ψ(q0 ) = (p0 , 0) and its derivative
dψ(q0 ) : Tq0 N → Tp0 M × Rn−m
sends w ∈ Tq0 N to (df (q0 )w, Aw) and is therefore bijective. Hence it follows
from the inverse function theorem for manifolds (Theorem 2.2.17) that there
exists an N -open neighborhood V ⊂ N of q0 such that the set
W := ψ(N ) ⊂ M × Rn−m
is an open neighborhood of (p0 , 0) and ψ|V : V → W is a diffeomorphism.
Let
U := {p ∈ M | (p, 0) ∈ W }
and define the map g : U → N by
g(p) := ψ −1 (p, 0).
Then p0 ∈ U , g is smooth and
(p, 0) = ψ(g(p)) = (f (g(p)), A(g(p) − q0 )).
Hence f (g(p)) = p for all p ∈ U and
g(p0 ) = ψ −1 (p0 , 0) = q0 .
This shows that (i) implies (ii). The converse is an easy consequence of the
chain rule and is left to the reader. This proves Lemma 2.6.1
Corollary 2.6.2. The image of a submersion f : N → M is open.
Proof. If p0 = f (q0 ) ∈ f (N ), then the neighborhood U ⊂ M of p0 in
Lemma 2.6.1 (ii) is contained in the image of f .
Corollary 2.6.3. If N is a nonempty compact manifold, M is a connected
manifold, and f : N → M is a submersion, then f is surjective and M is
compact.
Proof. The image f (N ) is an open subset of M by Corollary 2.6.2, it is a
relatively closed subset of M because N is compact, and it is nonempty
because N is nonempty. Since M is connected this implies that f (N ) = M .
In particular, M is compact.
Exercise 2.6.4. Let f : N → M be a smooth map. Prove that the
sets {q ∈ N | df (q) is injective} and {q ∈ N | df (q) is surjective} are open (in
the relative topology of N ).

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Vector Bundles

Let M ⊂ Rk be an m-dimensional smooth manifold.
Definition 2.6.5. A (smooth) vector bundle (over M of rank n) is a
smooth submanifold E ⊂ M × Rℓ of dimension m + n such that, for every
point p ∈ M , the set
n
o
Ep := v ∈ Rℓ | (p, v) ∈ E
is an n-dimensional linear subspace of Rℓ (called the fiber of E over p).
A vector bundle E over M is equipped with a smooth map
π:E→M
defined by π(p, v) := p. This map is called the canonical projection of E.
If E ⊂ M × Rℓ is a vector bundle, then a (smooth) section of E is a
smooth map s : M → Rℓ such that s(p) ∈ Ep for every p ∈ M .
A section s : M → Rℓ of a vector bundle E over M determines a smooth
map σ : M → E which sends the point p ∈ M to the pair (p, s(p)) ∈ E.
This map satisfies π ◦ σ = id. It is sometimes convenient to abuse notation
and eliminate the distinction between s and σ. Thus we will sometimes use
the same letter s for the map from M to Rℓ and the map from M to E.
Definition 2.6.6. Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold. The set
T M := {(p, v) | p ∈ M, v ∈ Tp M }
is called the tangent bundle of M .
The tangent bundle is a subset of M × Rk and, for every p ∈ M , its
fiber Tp M is an m-dimensional linear subspace of Rk by Theorem 2.2.3.
However, it is not immediately obvious from the definition that T M is a
submanifold of M × Rk . This will be proved below. The sections of T M are
the vector fields on M .
Exercise 2.6.7. Let f : M → N be a smooth map between manifolds.
Prove that the tangent map T M → T N : (p, v) 7→ (f (p), df (p)v) is smooth.
Exercise 2.6.8. Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold and let ϕ : U → Ω
be a smooth coordinate chart on an M -open set U ⊂ M with values in an
open set Ω = ϕ(U ) ⊂ Rm . Prove that the map ϕe : T U → Ω × Rm defined
e v) := (ϕ(p), dϕ(p)) for p ∈ U and v ∈ Tp M is a diffeomorphism. It
by ϕ(p,
is called a standard coordinate chart on T M . Deduce that T M is
a smooth 2m-dimensional submanifold of M × Rk and hence is a smooth
vector bundle over M . (See also Corollary 2.6.12 below.)

Exercise 2.6.9. Let V ⊂ Rℓ be an n-dimensional linear subspace. The
orthogonal projection of Rℓ onto V is the matrix Π ∈ Rℓ×ℓ that satisfies
Π = Π2 = ΠT ,

im Π = V.

(2.6.1)

Prove that there is a unique matrix Π ∈ Rℓ×ℓ satisfying (2.6.1). Prove that,
for every symmetric matrix S = S T ∈ Rℓ×ℓ , the kernel of S is the orthogonal
complement of the image of S. If D ∈ Rℓ×n is any injective matrix whose
image is V , prove that det(DT D) ̸= 0 and
Π = D(DT D)−1 DT .

(2.6.2)

Theorem 2.6.10 (Vector bundles). Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold
and let E ⊂ M × Rℓ be a subset. Assume that, for every p ∈ M , the set
n
o
Ep := v ∈ Rℓ | (p, v) ∈ E
(2.6.3)
is an n-dimensional linear subspace of Rℓ . Let Π : M → Rℓ×ℓ be the map
that assigns to each p ∈ M the orthogonal projection of Rℓ onto Ep , i.e.
Π(p) = Π(p)2 = Π(p)T ,

im Π(p) = Ep .

(2.6.4)

Then the following are equivalent.
(i) E is a vector bundle.
(ii) For every p0 ∈ M and every v0 ∈ Ep0 there is a smooth map s : M → Rℓ
such that s(p0 ) = v0 and s(p) ∈ Ep for all p ∈ M .
(iii) The map Π : M → Rℓ×ℓ is smooth.
(iv) For every p0 ∈ M there is an open neighborhood U ⊂ M of p0 and a
diffeomorphism π −1 (U ) → U × Rn : (p, v) 7→ Φ(p, v) = (p, Φp (v)) such that
the map Φp : Ep → Rn is an isometric isomorphism for all p ∈ U .
(v) For every p0 ∈ M there is an open neighborhood U ⊂ M of p0 and a
diffeomorphism π −1 (U ) → U × Rn : (p, v) 7→ Φ(p, v) = (p, Φp (v)) such that
the map Φp : Ep → Rn is a vector space isomorphism for all p ∈ U .
Condition (i) implies that the projection π : E → M is a submersion. In (ii)
the section s can be chosen to have compact support, i.e. there exists a
compact subset K ⊂ M such that s(p) = 0 for all p ∈ M \ K.
Before giving the proof of Theorem 2.6.10 we explain some of its consequences.

Corollary 2.6.12. Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold. Then T M is a
vector bundle over M and hence is a smooth 2m-manifold in Rk × Rk .
Proof. Let ϕ : U → Ω be a coordinate chart on an M -open set U ⊂ M with
values in an open subset Ω ⊂ Rm . Denote its inverse by ψ := ϕ−1 : Ω → M .
By Theorem 2.2.3 the linear map dψ(x) : Rm → Rk is injective and its image
is Tψ(x) M for every x ∈ Ω. Hence the map D : U → Rk×m defined by
D(p) := dψ(ϕ(p)) ∈ Rk×m
is smooth and, for every p ∈ U , the linear map D(p) : Rm → Rk is injective and its image is Tp M . Thus the function ΠT M : M → Rk×k defined
by (2.6.4) with Ep = Tp M is given by

−1
ΠT M (p) = D(p) D(p)T D(p)
D(p)T
for p ∈ U.
Hence ΠT M is smooth and so T M is a vector bundle by Theorem 2.6.10.
Let M ⊂ Rk be an m-manifold, N ⊂ Rℓ be an n-manifold, f : N → M
be a smooth map, and E ⊂ M × Rd be a vector bundle. The pullback
bundle is the vector bundle f ∗ E → N defined by
n
o
f ∗ E := (q, v) ∈ N × Rd | v ∈ Ef (q)
and the normal bundle of E is the vector bundle E ⊥ → M defined by
n
o
E ⊥ := (p, w) ∈ M × Rd | ⟨v, w⟩ = 0 ∀ v ∈ Ep .
Corollary 2.6.13. The pullback and normal bundles are vector bundles.
Proof. Let Π = ΠE : M → Rd×d be the map defined by (2.6.4). This map
is smooth by Theorem 2.6.10. Moreover, the corresponding maps for f ∗ E
and E ⊥ are given by
∗

Πf E = ΠE ◦ f : N → Rd×d ,

⊥

ΠE = 1l − ΠE : M → Rd×d .

These maps are smooth and hence it follows from Theorem 2.6.10 that f ∗ E
and E ⊥ are vector bundles.

2.6. VECTOR BUNDLES AND SUBMERSIONS

77

Proof of Theorem 2.6.10. We first assume that E is a vector bundle and
prove that π : E → M is a submersion. Let σ : M → E denote the zero
section given by σ(p) := (p, 0). Then π ◦σ = id and hence it follows from the
chain rule that the derivative dπ(p, 0) : T(p,0) E → Tp M is surjective. Now
it follows from Exercise 2.6.4 that for every p ∈ M there is an ε > 0 such
that the derivative dπ(p, v) : T(p,v) E → Tp M is surjective for every v ∈ Ep
with |v| < ε. Consider the map fλ : E → E defined by
fλ (p, v) := (p, λv).
This map is a diffeomorphism for every λ > 0. It satisfies
π = π ◦ fλ
and hence
dπ(p, v) = dπ(p, λv) ◦ dfλ (p, v) : T(p,v) E → Tp M.
Since dfλ (p, v) is bijective and dπ(p, λv) is surjective for λ < ε/ |v| it follows
that dπ(p, v) is surjective for every p ∈ M and every v ∈ Ep . Thus the
projection π : E → M is a submersion for every vector bundle E over M .
We prove that (i) implies (ii). Let p0 ∈ M and v0 ∈ Ep0 . We have
already proved that π is a submersion. Hence it follows from Lemma 2.6.1
that there exists an M -open neighborhood U ⊂ M of p0 and a smooth map
σ0 : U → E
such that
π ◦ σ0 = id : U → U,
Define the map s0

σ0 (p0 ) = (p0 , v0 ).

: U → Rℓ by
(p, s0 (p)) := σ0 (p)

for p ∈ U.

Then s0 (p0 ) = v0 and s0 (p) ∈ Ep for all p ∈ U . Now choose ε > 0 such that
{p ∈ M | |p − p0 | < ε} ⊂ U
and choose a smooth cutoff function β : Rk → [0, 1] such that β(p0 ) = 1
and β(p) = 0 for |p − p0 | ≥ ε. Define s : M → Rℓ by

β(p)s0 (p), if p ∈ U,
s(p) :=
0,
if p ∈
/ U.
This map satisfies the requirements of (ii).

78

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

We prove that (ii) implies (iii). Thus we assume that E satisfies (ii).
Choose p0 ∈ M and a basis v1 , . . . , vn of Ep0 . By (ii) there exists smooth
sections s1 , . . . , sn : M → Rℓ of E such that si (p0 ) = vi for i = 1, . . . , n. Now
there exists an M -open neighborhood U ⊂ M of p0 such that the vectors s1 (p), . . . , sn (p) are linearly independent, and hence form a basis of Ep
for every p ∈ U . Hence, for every p ∈ U , we have
Ep = imD(p),

D(p) := [s1 (p) · · · sn (p)] ∈ Rℓ×n .

By Exercise 2.6.9, this implies Π(p) = D(p)(D(p)T D(p))−1 D(p)T for every p ∈ U . Thus every p0 ∈ M has a neighborhood U such that the restriction of Π to U is smooth. This shows that (ii) implies (iii).
We prove that (iii) implies (iv). Fix a point p0 ∈ M and choose a basis v1 , . . . , vn of Ep0 . For p ∈ M define
D(p) := [Π(p)v1 · · · Π(p)vn ] ∈ Rℓ×n
Then D : M → Rℓ×n is a smooth map and D(p0 ) has rank n. Hence the set
U := {p ∈ M | rankD(p) = n} ⊂ M
is an open neighborhood of p0 and Ep = imD(p) for all p ∈ U . Thus
π −1 (U ) = {(p, v) ∈ E | p ∈ U } ⊂ E
is an open set containing π −1 (p0 ). Define the map Φ : π −1 (U ) → U × Rn by

−1/2

Φ(p, v) := p, Φp (v) ,
Φp (v) := D(p)T D(p)
D(p)T v
for p ∈ U and v ∈ Ep . This map is bijective and its inverse is given by

all p ∈ U and all v ∈ Ep . This shows that (iii) implies (iv).
That (iv) implies (v) is obvious.
We prove that (v) implies (i). Shrinking U if necessary, we may assume that there exists a coordinate chart ϕ : U → Ω with values in an open
set Ω ⊂ Rm . Then the composition (ϕ × id) ◦ Φ : π −1 (U ) → Ω × Rn is a diffeomorphism. Thus E ⊂ Rk × Rℓ is a manifold of dimension m + n and this
proves Theorem 2.6.10.
Exercise 2.6.14. Define the notion of an isomorphism between two vector
bundles E and F over M . Construct a vector bundle E ⊂ S 1 × R2 of rank 1
that does not admit a global trivialization, i.e. that is not isomorphic to the
trivial bundle S 1 × R. Such a vector bundle is called a Möbius strip.

The Implicit Function Theorem
Next we carry over the Implicit Function Theorem in Corollary A.2.6 to
smooth maps on vector bundles.
Theorem 2.6.15 (Implicit Function Theorem).
Let M ⊂ Rk be a smooth m-manifold, let N ⊂ Rk be a smooth n-manifold,
let E ⊂ M × Rℓ be a smooth vector bundle of rank n, let W ⊂ E be open,
and let f : W → N be a smooth map. For p ∈ M define fp : Wp → N by
Wp := {v ∈ Ep | (p, v) ∈ W } ,

fp (v) := f (p, v).

Let p0 ∈ M such that 0 ∈ Wp0 and dfp0 (0) : Ep0 → Tq0 N is bijective,
where q0 := f (p0 , 0) ∈ N . Then there exist a constant ε > 0, open neighborhoods U0 ⊂ M of p0 and V0 ⊂ N of q0 , and a smooth map h : U0 × V0 → Rℓ
such that {(p, v) ∈ E | p ∈ U0 , |v| < ε} ⊂ W and
h(p, q) ∈ Ep ,

|h(p, q)| < ε

(2.6.5)

for all (p, q) ∈ U0 × V0 and
fp (v) = q

⇐⇒

v = h(p, q)

(2.6.6)

for all (p, q) ∈ U0 × V0 and all v ∈ Ep with |v| < ε. Thus h(p0 , q0 ) = 0.
Proof. Choose a coordinate chart ψ : V → Rn on an open set V ⊂ N containing q0 . Choose an open neighborhood U ⊂ M of p0 such that (p, 0) ∈ W
and f (p, 0) ∈ V for all p ∈ U , there is a coordinate chart ϕ : U → Ω ⊂ Rm ,
and there is a local trivialization Φ : π −1 (U ) → U × Rn as in Theorem 2.6.10
with |Φp (v)| = |v| for p ∈ U and v ∈ Ep . Define Br := {ξ ∈ Rn | |ξ| < r} and
choose r > 0 so small that Φ−1 (U × Br ) ⊂ W and f ◦ Φ−1 (U × Br ) ⊂ V .
Define the map F : Ω × Rn × Br → Rn by

F (x, y, ξ) := ψ ◦ f ◦ Φ−1 ϕ−1 (x), ξ − y
for (x, y) ∈ Ω × Rn and ξ ∈ Br . Let x0 := ϕ(p0 ) and y0 := ψ(q0 ). Then
we have F (x0 , y0 , 0) = 0 and the derivative d3 F (x0 , y0 , 0) : Rn → Rn of F
with respect to ξ at (x0 , y0 , 0) is bijective. Hence Corollary A.2.6 asserts
that there exist open neighborhoods U0 ⊂ U of p0 and V0 ⊂ V of q0 , a constant 0 < ε < r, and a smooth map g : ϕ(U0 ) × ψ(V0 ) → Bε such that
F (x, y, ξ) = 0

⇐⇒

g(x, y) = ξ

for all (x, y) ∈ ϕ(U0 ) × ψ(V0 ) and all ξ ∈ Bε . Thus the map
h : U0 × V 0 → R ℓ ,


h(p, q) := Φ−1
g(ϕ(p), ψ(q)) ,
p

satisfies the requirements of Theorem 2.6.15.

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

The Theorem of Frobenius

Let M ⊂ Rk be an m-dimensional manifold and n be a nonnegative integer.
A subbundle of rank n of the tangent bundle T M is a subset E ⊂ T M
that is itself a vector bundle of rank n over M , i.e. it is a submanifold
of T M and the fiber Ep = {v ∈ Tp M | (p, v) ∈ E} is an n-dimensional linear
subspace of Tp M for every p ∈ M . Note that the rank n of a subbundle
is necessarily less than or equal to m. In the literature a subbundle of the
tangent bundle is sometimes called a distribution on M . We shall, however,
not use this terminology in order to avoid confusion with the concept of a
distribution in the functional analytic setting.
Definition 2.7.1. Let M ⊂ Rk be an m-dimensional manifold and E ⊂ T M
be a subbundle of rank n. The subbundle E is called involutive if, for any
two vector fields X, Y ∈ Vect(M ), we have
X(p), Y (p) ∈ Ep ∀ p ∈ M

=⇒

[X, Y ](p) ∈ Ep ∀ p ∈ M. (2.7.1)

The subundle E is called integrable if, for every p0 ∈ M , there exists a
submanifold N ⊂ M such that p0 ∈ N and Tp N = Ep for every p ∈ N .
A foliation box for E (see Figure 2.13) is a coordinate chart ϕ : U → Ω
on an M -open subset U ⊂ M with values in an open set Ω ⊂ Rn × Rm−n
such that the set Ω ∩ (Rn × {y}) is connected for every y ∈ Rm−n and, for
every p ∈ U and every v ∈ Tp M , we have
v ∈ Ep

⇐⇒

Theorem 2.7.2 (Frobenius). Let M ⊂ Rk be an m-dimensional manifold
and E ⊂ T M be a subbundle of rank n. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) E is involutive.
(ii) E is integrable.
(iii) For every p0 ∈ M there exists a foliation box ϕ : U → Ω with p0 ∈ U .

2.7. THE THEOREM OF FROBENIUS

81

It is easy to show that (iii) =⇒ (ii) =⇒ (i) (see below). The hard part of
the theorem is to prove that (i) =⇒ (iii). This requires the following lemma.
Lemma 2.7.3. Let E ⊂ T M be an involutive subbundle and X ∈ Vect(M )
be a complete vector field such that X(p) ∈ Ep for every p ∈ M . Denote by
R → Diff(M ) : t 7→ ϕt
the flow of X. Then, for all t ∈ R and all p ∈ M , we have
dϕt (p)Ep = Eϕt (p) .

(2.7.2)

We show first how Theorem 2.7.2 follows from Lemma 2.7.3.
Lemma 2.7.3 implies Theorem 2.7.2. We prove first that (iii) implies (ii).
Let p0 ∈ M , choose a foliation box ϕ : U → Ω for E with p0 ∈ U , and define
N := (p ∈ U | ϕ(p) ∈ Rn × {y0 }}
where (x0 , y0 ) := ϕ(p0 ) ∈ Ω. Then N satisfies the requirements of (ii).
We prove that (ii) implies (i). Choose two vector fields X, Y ∈ Vect(M )
that satisfy X(p), Y (p) ∈ Ep for all p ∈ M and fix a point p0 ∈ M . Then,
by (ii), there exists a submanifold N ⊂ M containing p0 such that Tp N = Ep
for every p ∈ N . Hence the restrictions X|N and Y |N are vector fields
on N and so is the restriction of the Lie bracket [X, Y ] to N . Thus we
have [X, Y ](p0 ) ∈ Tp0 N = Ep0 as claimed.
We prove that (i) implies (iii). Thus we assume that E is an involutive
subbundle of T M and fix a point p0 ∈ M . By Theorem 2.6.10 there exist
vector fields X1 , . . . , Xn ∈ Vect(M ) such that Xi (p) ∈ Ep for all i and p and
the vectors X1 (p0 ), . . . , Xn (p0 ) form a basis of Ep0 . Using Theorem 2.6.10
again we find vector fields Y1 , . . . , Ym−n ∈ Vect(M ) such that the vectors
X1 (p0 ), . . . , Xn (p0 ), Y1 (p0 ), . . . , Ym−n (p0 )
form a basis of Tp0 M . Using cutoff functions as in the proof of Theorem 2.6.10 we may assume without loss of generality that the vector fields Xi
and Yj have compact support and hence are complete (see Exercise 2.4.13).
Denote by ϕt1 , . . . , ϕtn the flows of the vector fields X1 , . . . , Xn , respectively,
t
and by ψ1t , . . . , ψm−n
the flows of the vector fields Y1 , . . . , Ym−n . Define the

By Lemma 2.7.3, this map satisfies
∂ψ
(x, y) ∈ Eψ(x,y)

(2.7.3)

for all x ∈ Rn and y ∈ Rm−n . Moreover,
∂ψ
(0, 0) = Xi (p0 ),
∂xi

∂ψ
(0, 0) = Yj (p0 ),
∂yj

and so the derivative
dψ(0, 0) : Rn × Rm−n → Tp0 M
is bijective. Hence, by the Inverse Function Theorem 2.2.17, there exists an
open neighborhood Ω ⊂ Rn × Rm−n of the origin such that the set
U := ψ(Ω) ⊂ M
is an M -open neighborhood of p0 and ψ|Ω : Ω → U is a diffeomorphism.
Thus the vectors ∂ψ/∂xi (x, y) are linearly independent for every (x, y) ∈ Ω
and, by (2.7.3), form a basis of Eψ(x,y) . Hence
ϕ := (ψ|Ω )−1 : U → Ω
is a foliation box and this proves Theorem 2.7.2, assuming Lemma 2.7.3.
To complete the proof of the Frobenius theorem it remains to prove
Lemma 2.7.3. This requires the following result.
Lemma 2.7.4. Let E ⊂ T M be an involutive subbundle. If β : R2 → M is
a smooth map such that

for all s, t ∈ R.
We first show how Lemma 2.7.3 follows from Lemma 2.7.4.

(2.7.5)

2.7. THE THEOREM OF FROBENIUS

83

Lemma 2.7.4 implies Lemma 2.7.3. Let X ∈ Vect(M ) be a complete vector
field satisfying X(p) ∈ Ep for every p ∈ M and let ϕt be the flow of X.
Choose a point p0 ∈ M and a vector v0 ∈ Ep0 . By Theorem 2.6.10 there is a
vector field Y ∈ Vect(M ) with values in E such that Y (p0 ) = v0 . Moreover
this vector field may be chosen to have compact support and hence it is
complete (see Exercise 2.4.13). Thus there is a solution γ : R → M of the
initial value problem
γ̇(s) = Y (γ(s)),
Define β : R2 → M by

γ(0) = p0 .

β(s, t) := ϕt (γ(s))

for s, t ∈ R. Then
∂β
(s, 0) = γ̇(s) = Y (γ(s)) ∈ Eβ(s,0) ,
∂s
∂β
(s, t) = X(β(s, t)) ∈ Eβ(s,t)
∂t
for all s, t ∈ R. Hence it follows from Lemma 2.7.4 that
∂β
(0, t) ∈ Eϕt (p0 )
∂s
for every t ∈ R. This proves Lemma 2.7.3, assuming Lemma 2.7.4.
dϕt (p0 )v0 = dϕt (γ(0))γ̇(0) =

Proof of Lemma 2.7.4. Given any point p0 ∈ M we choose a coordinate
chart ϕ : U → Ω, defined on an M -open set U ⊂ M with values in an
open set Ω ⊂ Rn × Rm−n , such that p0 ∈ U and dϕ(p0 )Ep0 = Rn × {0}.
Shrinking U , if necessary, we find that for every p ∈ U the linear subspace dϕ(p)Ep ⊂ Rn × Rm−n is the graph of a matrix A ∈ R(m−n)×n . Thus
there exists a smooth map A : Ω → R(m−n)×n such that, for every p ∈ U ,
dϕ(p)Ep = {(ξ, A(x, y)ξ) | ξ ∈ Rn } ,

(x, y) := ϕ(p) ∈ Ω.

to local coordinates, we obtain from Claim 2 that W is open. Moreover, W
is obviously closed, and W ̸= ∅ because 0 ∈ W by (2.7.4). Hence W = R.
Since s0 ∈ R was chosen arbitrarily, this proves (2.7.5) and Lemma 2.7.4.
Any subbundle E ⊂ T M determines an equivalence relation on M via
p0 ∼ p1 ⇐⇒

there is a smooth curve γ : [0, 1] → M
(2.7.10)
such that γ(0) = p0 , γ(1) = p1 , γ̇(t) ∈ Eγ(t) ∀ t.

If E is integrable, this equivalence relation is called a foliation and the
equivalence class of p0 ∈ M is called the leaf of the foliation through p0 .
The next example shows that the leaves do not need to be submanifolds.

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Example 2.7.5. Consider the torus M := S 1 × S 1 ⊂ C2 with the tangent
bundle

T M = (z1 , z2 , iλ1 z1 , iλ2 z2 ) ∈ C4 | |z1 | = |z2 | = 1, λ1 , λ2 ∈ R .
Let ω1 , ω2 be real numbers and consider the subbundle

E := (z1 , z2 , itω1 z1 , itω2 z2 ) ∈ C4 | |z1 | = |z2 | = 1, t ∈ R .
The leaf of this subbundle through z = (z1 , z2 ) ∈ T2 is given by

L=
eitω1 z1 , eitω2 z2 t ∈ R .
It is a submanifold if and only if the quotient ω1 /ω2 is a rational number
(or ω2 = 0). Otherwise each leaf is a dense subset of T2 .
Exercise 2.7.6. Prove that (2.7.10) defines an equivalence relation for every
subbundle E ⊂ T M .
Exercise 2.7.7. Each subbundle E ⊂ T M of rank 1 is integrable.
Exercise 2.7.8. Consider the manifold M = R3 . Prove that the subbundle E ⊂ T M = R3 × R3 with fiber Ep = (ξ, η, ζ) ∈ R3 | ζ − yξ = 0
over p = (x, y, z) ∈ R3 is not integrable and that any two points in R3 can
be joined by a path tangent to E.
Exercise 2.7.9. Consider the manifold M = S 3 ⊂ R4 = C2 and define

E := (z, ζ) ∈ C2 × C2 | |z| = 1, ζ ⊥ z, iζ ⊥ z .
Thus the fiber
Ez ⊂ Tz S 3 = z ⊥
is the maximal complex linear subspace of Tz S 3 . Prove that E has real
rank 2 and is not integrable.
Exercise 2.7.10. Let E ⊂ T M be an involutive subbundle of rank n and
let L ⊂ M be a leaf of the foliation determined by E. A subset V ⊂ L is
called L-open iff it can be written as a union of submanifolds N of M
with tangent spaces Tp N = Ep for p ∈ N . Prove that the L-open sets form
a topology on L (called the intrinsic topology). Prove that the obvious
inclusion ι : L → M is continuous with respect to the intrinsic topology on L.
Prove that the inclusion ι : L → M is proper if and only if the intrinsic
topology on L agrees with the relative topology inherited from M (called
the extrinsic topology).
Remark 2.7.11. It is surprisingly difficult to prove that each closed leaf L
of a foliation is a submanifold of M . A proof due to David Epstein [19] is
sketched in §2.9.4 below.

The Intrinsic Definition of a Manifold*

It is somewhat restrictive to only consider manifolds that are embedded in
some Euclidean space. Although we shall see that (at least) every compact
manifold admits an embedding into a Euclidean space, such an embedding is
in many cases not a natural part of the structure of a manifold. In particular,
we encounter manifolds that are described as quotient spaces and there are
manifolds that are embedded in certain infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
For this reason it is convenient, at this point, to introduce a more general
intrinisc definition of a manifold. (See Chapter 1 for an overview.) This
requires some background from point set topology that is not covered in
the first year analysis courses. We shall then see that all the definitions and
results of this chapter carry over in a natural manner to the intrinsic setting.
We begin by recalling the intrinsing definition of a smooth manifold in §1.4.

Figure 2.14: Coordinate charts and transition maps.
Definition 2.8.1 (Smooth m-manifold). Let m ∈ N0 and M be a set.
A chart on M is a pair (ϕ, U ) where U ⊂ M and ϕ is a bijection from U
to an open set ϕ(U ) ⊂ Rm . Two charts (ϕ1 , U1 ), (ϕ2 , U2 ) are called compatible iff ϕ1 (U1 ∩ U2 ) and ϕ2 (U1 ∩ U2 ) are open and the transition map
ϕ21 = ϕ2 ◦ ϕ−1
1 : ϕ1 (U1 ∩ U2 ) → ϕ2 (U1 ∩ U2 )

(2.8.1)

is a diffeomorphism (see Figure 2.14). A smooth atlas on M is a collection A of charts on M any two of which are compatible and such that the
sets U , as (ϕ, U ) ranges over A , cover M (i.e. for every p ∈ M there exists
a chart (ϕ, U ) ∈ A with p ∈ U ). A maximal smooth atlas is an atlas
which contains every chart which is compatible with each of its members.
A smooth m-manifold is a pair consisting of a set M and a maximal
atlas A on M .

88

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

In Lemma 1.4.3 it was shown that, if A is an atlas, then so is the
collection A of all charts compatible with each member of A . Moreover,
the atlas A is maximal, so every atlas extends uniquely to a maximal atlas.
For this reason, a manifold is usually specified by giving its underlying set M
and some atlas on M . Generally, the notation for the atlas is suppressed and
the manifold is denoted simply by M . The members of the atlas are called
coordinate charts or simply charts on M . By Lemma 1.3.3 a smooth
m-manifold admits a unique topology such that, for each chart (ϕ, U ) of the
smooth atlas, the set U ⊂ M is open and the bijection
ϕ : U → ϕ(U )
is a homeomorphism onto the open set ϕ(U ) ⊂ Rm . This topology is called
the intrinsic topology of M and is described in the following definition.
Definition 2.8.2. Let M be a smooth m-manifold. The intrinsic topology
on the set M is the topology induced by the charts, i.e. a subset
W ⊂M
is open in the intrinsic topology iff ϕ(U ∩ W ) is an open subset of Rm for
every chart (ϕ, U ) on M .1
Remark 2.8.3. Let M ⊂ Rk be smooth m-dimensional submanifold of Rk
as in Definition 2.1.3. Then the set of all diffeomorphisms (ϕ, U ∩ M ) as
in Definition 2.1.3 form a smooth atlas as in Definition 2.8.1. The intrinsic topology on the resulting smooth manifold is the same as the relative
topology defined in §1.3.
Remark 2.8.4. A topological manifold is a topological space such that
each point has a neighborhood U homeomorphic to an open subset of Rm .
Thus a smooth manifold (with the intrinsic topology) is a topological manifold and its maximal smooth atlas A is a subset of the set A0 of all
pairs (ϕ, U ) where U ⊂ M is an open set and ϕ is a homeomorphism from U
to an open subset of Rm . One says that the maximal smooth atlas A is a
smooth structure on the topological manifold M iff the topology of M is
the intrinsic topology of the smooth structure and every chart of the smooth
structure is a homeomorphism. As explained in §1.4 a topological manifold
can have many distinct smooth structures (see Remark 1.4.6). However, it
is a deep theorem beyond the scope of this book that there are topological
manifolds which do not admit any smooth structure.
1

At this point we do not assume that the intrinsic topology on the manifold M is
Hausdorff or second countable. These hypotheses will be imposed after the end of the
present chapter. For explanations see the comments at the end of §2.8.1 and of §2.9.5.

Example 2.8.5. The complex projective space CPn is the set

CPn = ℓ ⊂ Cn+1 | ℓ is a 1-dimensional complex subspace
of complex lines in Cn+1 . It can be identified with the quotient space

CPn = Cn+1 \ {0} /C∗
of nonzero vectors in Cn+1 modulo the action of the multiplicative group
C∗ = C \ {0} of nonzero complex numbers. The equivalence class of a
nonzero vector z = (z0 , . . . , zn ) ∈ Cn+1 will be denoted by
[z] = [z0 : z1 : · · · : zn ] := {λz | λ ∈ C∗ }
and the associated line is ℓ = Cz. An atlas on CPn is given by the open
cover Ui := {[z0 : · · · : zn ] | zi ̸= 0} for i = 0, 1, . . . , n and the coordinate
charts ϕi : Ui → Cn are

Exercise: Prove that each ϕi is a homeomorphism and the transition maps
are holomorphic. Prove that the manifold topology is the quotient topology,
i.e. if π : Cn+1 \ {0} → CPn denotes the obvious projection, then a subset U ⊂ CPn is open if and only if π −1 (U ) is an open subset of Cn+1 \ {0}.
Example 2.8.6. The real projective space RPn is the set

RPn = ℓ ⊂ Rn+1 | ℓ is a 1-dimensional linear subspace
of real lines in Rn+1 . It can again be identified with the quotient space

RPn = Rn+1 \ {0} /R∗
of nonzero vectors in Rn+1 modulo the action of the multiplicative group
R∗ = R \ {0} of nonzero real numbers, and the equivalence class of a nonzero
vector x = (x0 , . . . , xn ) ∈ Rn+1 will be denoted by
[x] = [x0 : x1 : · · · : xn ] := {λx | λ ∈ R∗ } .
An atlas on RPn is given by the open cover
Ui := {[x0 : · · · : xn ] | xi ̸= 0}
and the coordinate charts ϕi : Ui → Rn are again given by (2.8.2), with zj
replaced by xj . The arguments in Example 2.8.5 show that these coordinate
charts form an atlas and the manifold topology is the quotient topology. The
transition maps are real analytic diffeomorphisms.

90

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Example 2.8.7. The real n-torus is the topological space
Tn := Rn /Zn
equipped with the quotient topology. Thus two vectors x, y ∈ Rn are equivalent iff their difference x − y ∈ Zn is an integer vector and we denote by
π : Rn → Tn the obvious projection which assigns to each vector x ∈ Rn its
equivalence class
π(x) := [x] := x + Zn .
Then a set U ⊂ Tn is open if and only if the set π −1 (U ) is an open subset
of Rn . An atlas on Tn is given by the open cover
Uα := {[x] | x ∈ Rn , |x − α| < 1/2} ,
parametrized by vectors α ∈ Rn , and the coordinate charts ϕα : Uα → Rn
defined by ϕα ([x]) := x for x ∈ Rn with |x − α| < 1/2. Exercise: Show
that each transition map for this atlas is a translation by an integer vector.
Example 2.8.8. Consider the complex Grassmannian
Gk (Cn ) := {V ⊂ Cn | v is a k-dimensional complex linear subspace} .
This set can again be described as a quotient space Gk (Cn ) ∼
= Fk (Cn )/U(k).
Here
n
o
Fk (Cn ) := D ∈ Cn×k | D∗ D = 1l
denotes the set of unitary k-frames in Cn and the group U(k) acts on Fk (Cn )
contravariantly by D 7→ Dg for g ∈ U(k). The projection
π : Fk (Cn ) → Gk (Cn )
sends a matrix D ∈ Fk (Cn ) to its image V := π(D) := im D. A subset
U ⊂ Gk (Cn ) is open if and only if π −1 (U ) is an open subset of Fk (Cn ). Given
a k-dimensional subspace V ⊂ Cn we can define an open set UV ⊂ Gk (Cn ) as
the set of all k-dimensional subspaces of Cn that can be represented as graphs
of linear maps from V to V ⊥ . This set of graphs can be identified with the
complex vector space HomC (V, V ⊥ ) of complex linear maps from V to V ⊥
and hence with C(n−k)×k . This leads to an atlas on Gk (Cn ) with holomorphic
transition maps and shows that Gk (Cn ) is a manifold of complex dimension
kn − k 2 . Exercise: Verify the details of this construction. Find explicit
formulas for the coordinate charts and their transition maps. Carry this
over to the real setting. Show that CPn and RPn are special cases.

2.8. THE INTRINSIC DEFINITION OF A MANIFOLD*

Example 2.8.9 (The real line with two zeros). A topological space M
is called Hausdorff iff any two points in M can be separated by disjoint
open neighborhoods. This example shows that a manifold need not be a
Hausdorff space. Consider the quotient space
M := R × {0, 1}/ ≡
where [x, 0] ≡ [x, 1] for x ̸= 0. An atlas on M consists of two coordinate
charts ϕ0 : U0 → R and ϕ1 : U1 → R where
Ui := {[x, i] | x ∈ R} ,

ϕi ([x, i]) := x

for i = 0, 1. Thus M is a 1-manifold. But the topology on M is not
Hausdorff, because the points [0, 0] and [0, 1] cannot be separated by disjoint
open neighborhoods.
Example 2.8.10 (A 2-manifold without a countable atlas). Consider
the vector space X = R × R2 with the equivalence relation
[t1 , x1 , y1 ] ≡ [t2 , x2 , y2 ] ⇐⇒

either y1 = y2 ̸= 0, t1 + x1 y1 = t2 + x2 y2
or y1 = y2 = 0, t1 = t2 , x1 = x2 .

For y ̸= 0 we have [0, x, y] ≡ [t, x − t/y, y], however, each point (x, 0) on
the x-axis gets replaced by the uncountable set R × {(x, 0)}. Our manifold
is the quotient space M := X/ ≡. This time we do not use the quotient
topology but the topology induced by our atlas (see Definition 2.8.2). The
coordinate charts are parametrized by the reals: for t ∈ R the set Ut ⊂ M
and the coordinate chart ϕt : Ut → R2 are given by
Ut := {[t, x, y] | x, y ∈ R} ,

ϕt ([t, x, y]) := (x, y).

A subset U ⊂ M is open, by definition, iff ϕt (U ∩ Ut ) is an open subset of R2
for every t ∈ R. With this topology each ϕt is a homeomorphism from Ut
onto R2 and M admits a countable dense subset S := {[0, x, y] | x, y ∈ Q}.
However, there is no atlas on M consisting of countably many charts. (Each
coordinate chart can contain at most countably many of the points [t, 0, 0].)
The function f : M → R given by f ([t, x, y]) := t + xy is smooth and each
point [t, 0, 0] is a critical point of f with value t. Thus f has no regular
value. Exercise: Show that M is a path-connected Hausdorff space.
In Theorem 2.9.12 we will show that smooth manifolds whose topology is
Hausdorff and second countable are precisely those that can be embedded in
Euclidean space. Most authors tacitly assume that manifolds are Hausdorff
and second countable and so will we after the end of the present chapter.
However before §2.9.1 there is no need to impose these hypotheses.

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Smooth Maps and Diffeomorphisms

Our next goal is to carry over all the definitions from embedded manifolds
in Euclidean space to the intrinsic setting.
Definition 2.8.11 (Smooth map). Let
(M, {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A ),

(N, {(ψβ , Vβ )}β∈B )

be smooth manifolds. A map f : M → N is called smooth iff it is continuous and the map
−1
fβα := ψβ ◦ f ◦ ϕ−1
(Vβ )) → ψβ (Vβ )
α : ϕα (Uα ∩ f

(2.8.3)

is smooth for every α ∈ A and every β ∈ B. It is called a diffeomorphism
iff it is bijective and f and f −1 are smooth. The manifolds M and N are
called diffeomorphic iff there exists a diffeomorphism f : M → N .
The reader may check that the notion of a smooth map is independent
of the atlas used in the definition, that compositions of smooth maps are
smooth, and that sums and products of smooth maps from M to R are
smooth.
Exercise 2.8.12. Let M be a smooth m-dimensional manifold with an atlas

Tangent Spaces and Derivatives

In the situation where M is a submanifold of Euclidean space and p ∈ M we
have defined the tangent space of M at p as the set of all derivatives γ̇(0) of
smooth curves γ : R → M that pass through p = γ(0). We cannot do this
for manifolds in the intrinsic sense, as the derivative of a curve has yet to be
defined. In fact, the purpose of introducing a tangent space of M is precisely
to allow us to define what we mean by the derivative of a smooth map. There
are two approaches. One is to introduce an appropriate equivalence relation
on the set of curves through p and the other is to use local coordinates.
Definition 2.8.14. Let M be a manifold with an atlas A = {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A
and let p ∈ M . Two smooth curves γ0 , γ1 : R → M with γ0 (0) = γ1 (0) = p
are called p-equivalent iff for some (and hence every) α ∈ A with p ∈ Uα
we have
d
d
ϕα (γ0 (t)) =
ϕα (γ1 (t)).
dt t=0
dt t=0
p

We write γ0 ∼ γ1 iff γ0 is p-equivalent to γ1 and denote the equivalence class
of a smooth curve γ : R → M with γ(0) = p by [γ]p . Every such equivalence
class is called a tangent vector of M at p. The tangent space of M at p
is the set of equivalence classes

Tp M := [γ]p γ : R → M is smooth and γ(0) = p .
(2.8.4)
Definition 2.8.15. Let M be a manifold with an atlas A = {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A
and let p ∈ M . The A -tangent space of M at p is the quotient space
.p
[
{α} × Rm ∼,

⇐⇒

x := ϕα (p).

Each equivalence class [α, ξ]p is called a tangent vector of M at p.
In Definition 2.8.14 it is not immediately obvious that the set Tp M
in (2.8.4) is a vector space. However, the quotient space TpA M in (2.8.5) is
obviously a vector space of dimension m and there is a natural bijection



Tp M → Tp M : [γ]p 7→ α,

This bijection induces a vector space structure on the set Tp M . In other
words, the set Tp M in (2.8.4) admits a unique vector space structure such
that the map Tp M → TpA M in (2.8.6) is a vector space isomorphism.

94

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Exercise 2.8.16. Verify the phrase “and hence every” in Definition 2.8.14
and deduce that the map Tp M → TpA M in (2.8.6) is well defined. Show
that it is bijective.
From now on we will use either Definition 2.8.14 or Definition 2.8.15 or
both, whichever way is most convenient, and drop the superscript A .
Definition 2.8.17 (Derivative of a smooth curve). For each smooth
curve γ : R → M with γ(0) = p we define the derivative γ̇(0) ∈ Tp M as the
equivalence class

Definition 2.8.18 (Derivative of a smooth map). Let f : M → N
be a smooth map between two smooth manifolds (M, {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A ) and
(N, {(ψβ , Vβ )}β∈B ) and let p ∈ M . The derivative of f at p is the map
df (p) : Tp M → Tf (p) N
defined by the formula
df (p)[γ]p := [f ◦ γ]f (p)

(2.8.7)

for each smooth curve γ : R → M with γ(0) = p. Here we use (2.8.4).
Under the isomorphism (2.8.6) this corresponds to the linear map
df (p)[α, ξ]p := [β, dfβα (x)ξ]f (p) ,

x := ϕα (p),

(2.8.8)

for α ∈ A with p ∈ Uα and β ∈ B with f (p) ∈ Vβ , where fβα is given
by (2.8.3).
Remark 2.8.19. Think of N = Rn as a manifold with a single coordinate
chart, namely the identity map ψβ = id : Rn → Rn . For every q ∈ N = Rn
the tangent space Tq N is then canonically isomorphic to Rn via (2.8.5).
Thus for every smooth map f : M → Rn the derivative of f at p ∈ M is a
linear map df (p) : Tp M → Rn , and the formula (2.8.8) reads
df (p)[α, ξ]p = d(f ◦ ϕ−1
α )(x)ξ,

x := ϕα (p).

This formula also applies to maps defined on some open subset of M . In
particular, with f = ϕα : Uα → Rm we have
dϕα (p)[α, ξ]p = ξ.
Thus the map dϕα (p) : Tp M → Rm is the canonical vector space isomorphism determined by α.
With these definitions the derivative of f at p is a linear map and we have
the chain rule for the composition of two smooth maps as in Theorem 2.2.14.

Submanifolds and Embeddings

Definition 2.8.20 (Submanifold). Let M be a smooth m-manifold and let
n ∈ {0, 1, . . . , m}. A subset N ⊂ M is called an n-dimensional submanifold
of M iff, for every p ∈ N , there exists a local coordinate chart ϕ : U → Ω
for M , defined on an an open neighborhood U ⊂ M of p and with values in
an open set Ω ⊂ Rn × Rm−n , such that ϕ(U ∩ N ) = Ω ∩ (Rn × {0}) .
By Theorem 2.1.10 an m-manifold M ⊂ Rk in the sense of Definition 2.1.3 is a submanifold of Rk in the sense of Definition 2.8.20. By Theorem 2.3.4 the notion of a submanifold N ⊂ M of a manifold M ⊂ Rk in
Definition 2.3.1 agrees with the notion of a submanifold in Definition 2.8.20.
Exercise 2.8.21. Let N be a submanifold of M . Show that if M is Hausdorff, so is N , and if M is paracompact, so is N .
Exercise 2.8.22. Let N be a submanifold of M and let P be a submanifold
of N . Prove that P is a submanifold of M . Hint: Use Theorem 2.1.10.
Exercise 2.8.23. Let N be a submanifold of M . Prove that there exists an
open set U ⊂ M such that N ⊂ U and N is closed in the relative topology
of U .
All the theorems we have proved for embedded manifolds and their proofs
carry over almost word for word to the present setting. For example we have
the inverse function theorem, the notion of a regular value, the notions of
a submersion and of an immersion, the notion of an embedding as a proper
injective immersion, and the fact from Theorem 2.3.4 that a subset P ⊂ M
is a submanifold if and only if it is the image of an embedding.

is an embedding. (Exercise: Prove this.) It restricts to an embedding of
the real projective plane into RP5 and also gives rise to embeddings of RP2

Tangent Bundle and Vector Fields

Let M be a m-manifold with an atlas A = {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A . The tangent
bundle of M is defined as the disjoint union of the tangent spaces, i.e.
[
T M :=
{p} × Tp M = {(p, v) | p ∈ M, v ∈ Tp M } .
p∈M

Denote by π : T M → M the projection given by π(p, v) := p. Recall the
notion of a submersion as a smooth map between smooth manifolds, whose
derivative is surjective at each point.
Lemma 2.8.27. The tangent bundle of M is a smooth 2m-manifold with
coordinate charts
eα := π −1 (Uα ) → ϕα (Uα ) × Rm ,
ϕeα : U

ϕeα (p, v) := (ϕα (p), dϕα (p)v) .

The projection π : T M → M is a surjective submersion. If M is second
countable and Hausdorff, so is T M .
Proof. For each pair α, β ∈ A the set
eα ∩ U
eβ ) = ϕα (Uα ∩ Uβ ) × Rm
ϕeα (U
is open in Rm × Rm and the transition map
e e
e e
e
e
ϕeβα := ϕeβ ◦ ϕe−1
α : ϕα (Uα ∩ Uβ ) → ϕβ (Uα ∩ Uβ )
is given by
ϕeβα (x, ξ) = (ϕβα (x), dϕβα (x)ξ)
for x ∈ ϕα (Uα ∩ Uβ ) and ξ ∈ Rm where
ϕβα := ϕβ ◦ ϕ−1
α .
Thus the transition maps are all diffeomorphisms and so the coordinate
charts ϕeα define an atlas on T M . The topology on T M is determined by
this atlas via Definition 2.8.2. If M has a countable atlas, so does T M . The
remaining assertions are easy exercises.
Definition 2.8.28. Let M be a smooth m-manifold. A (smooth) vector
field on M is a collection of tangent vectors X(p) ∈ Tp M , one for each
point p ∈ M , such that the map M → T M : p 7→ (p, X(p)) is smooth. The
set of all smooth vector fields on M will be denoted by Vect(M ).

98

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Associated to a vector field is a smooth map M → T M whose composition with the projection π : T M → M is the identity map on M . Strictly
speaking this map should be denoted by a symbol other than X, for exame However, it is convenient at this point, and common practice,
ple by X.
to slightly abuse notation and denote the map from M to T M also by X.
Thus a vector field can be defined as a smooth map
X : M → TM
such that
π ◦ X = id : M → M.
Such a map is also called a section of the tangent bundle.
Now suppose A = {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A is an atlas on M and X : M → T M
is a vector field on M . Then X determines a collection of smooth maps
Xα : ϕα (Uα ) → Rm
given by
Xα (x) := dϕα (p)X(p),

p := ϕ−1
α (x),

(2.8.9)

for x ∈ ϕα (Uα ). We can think of each Xα as a vector field on the open set
ϕα (Uα ) ⊂ Rm , representing the vector field X on the coordinate patch Uα .
These local vector fields Xα satisfy the condition
Xβ (ϕβα (x)) = dϕβα (x)Xα (x)

(2.8.10)

for x ∈ ϕα (Uα ∩ Uβ ). This equation can also be expressed in the form
Xα |ϕα (Uα ∩Uβ ) = ϕ∗βα Xβ |ϕβ (Uα ∩Uβ ) .

(2.8.11)

Conversely, any collection of smooth maps Xα : ϕα (Uα ) → Rm satisfying (2.8.10) determines a unique vectorfield X on M via (2.8.9). Thus we
can define the Lie bracket of two vector fields X, Y ∈ Vect(M ) by
[X, Y ]α (x) := [Xα , Yα ](x) = dXα (x)Yα (x) − dYα (x)Xα (x)

(2.8.12)

for α ∈ A and x ∈ ϕα (Uα ). It follows from equation (2.4.18) in Lemma 2.4.21
that the local vector fields
[X, Y ]α : ϕα (Uα ) → Rm
satisfy (2.8.11) and hence determine a unique vector field [X, Y ] on M via
[X, Y ](p) := dϕα (p)−1 [Xα , Yα ](ϕα (p)),

p ∈ Uα .

(2.8.13)

2.8. THE INTRINSIC DEFINITION OF A MANIFOLD*

99

Thus the Lie bracket of X and Y is defined on Uα as the pullback of the Lie
bracket of the vector fields Xα and Yα under the coordinate chart ϕα . With
this understood all the results in §2.4 about vector fields and flows along with
their proofs carry over word for word to the intrinsic setting whenever M is a
Hausdorff space. This includes the existence and uniquess result for integral
curves in Theorem 2.4.7, the concept of the flow of a vector field in Definition 2.4.8 and its properties in Theorem 2.4.9, the notion of completeness
of a vector field (that the integral curves exist for all time), and the various
properties of the Lie bracket such as the Jacobi identity (2.4.20), the formulas in Lemma 2.4.18, and the fact that the Lie bracket of two vector fields
vanishes if and only if the corresponding flows commute (see Lemma 2.4.26).
One can also carry over the notion of a subbundle E ⊂ T M of rank n to
the intrinsic setting by the condition that E is a smooth submanifold of T M
and intersects each fiber Tp M in an n-dimensional linear subspace
Ep := {v ∈ Tp M | (p, v) ∈ E} .
Then the characterization of subbundles in Theorem 2.6.10 and the theorem
of Frobenius 2.7.2 including their proofs also carry over to the intrinsic
setting whenever M is a Hausdorff space.

2.8.6

Coordinate Notation

Fix a coordinate chart ϕα : Uα → Rm on an m-manifold M . The components
of ϕα are smooth real valued functions on the open subset Uα of M and it
is customary to denote them by
x1 , . . . , xm : Uα → R.
The derivatives of these functions at p ∈ Uα are linear functionals
dxi (p) : Tp M → R,

i = 1, . . . , m.

(2.8.14)

They form a basis of the dual space
Tp∗ M := Hom(Tp M, R).
(A coordinate chart on M can in fact be characterized as an m-tuple of real
valued functions on an open subset of M whose derivatives are everywhere
linearly independent and which, taken together, form an injective map.)
The dual basis of Tp M will be denoted by
∂

For each p ∈ Uα it is the canonical basis of Tp M determined by ϕα . In the
notation of (2.8.5) and Remark 2.8.19 we have
∂
(p) = [α, ei ]p = dϕα (p)−1 ei ,
∂xi
where ei = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) (with 1 in the ith place) denotes the standard basis vector of Rm . In other words, for all ξ = (ξ 1 , . . . , ξ m ) ∈ Rm and
all p ∈ Uα , the tangent vector

is given by

Consequences of Paracompactness*

In geometry it is often necessary to turn a construction in local coordinates
into a global geometric object. A key technical tool for such “local to global”
constructions is an existence theorem for partitions of unity.

2.9.1

Paracompactness

The existence of a countable atlas is of fundamental importance for almost
everything we will prove about manifolds. The next two remarks describe
several equivalent conditions.
Remark 2.9.1. Let M be a smooth manifold and denote by
U ⊂ 2M
the topology induced by the atlas as in Definition 2.8.2. Then the following
are equivalent.
(a) M admits a countable atlas.
(b) M is σ-compact, i.e. there is a sequence of compact
subsets Ki ⊂ M
S∞
such that Ki ⊂ int(Ki+1 ) for every i ∈ N and M = i=1 Ki .
(c) Every open cover of M has a countable subcover.
(d) M is second countable, i.e. there is a countable collection of open sets
B ⊂ U such that every open set U ∈ U is a union of open sets from the
collection B. (B is then called a countable base for the topology of M .)
That (a) =⇒ (b) =⇒ (c) =⇒ (a) and (a) =⇒ (d) follows directly from the
definitions. The proof that (d) implies (a) requires the construction of a
countable refinement and the axiom of choice. (A refinement of an open
cover {Ui }i∈I is an open cover {Vj }j∈J such that each set Vj is contained in
one of the sets Ui .)
Remark 2.9.2. Let M and U be as in Remark 2.9.1 and suppose in addition that M is a connected Hausdorff space. Then the existence of a
countable atlas is also equivalent to each of the following conditions.
(e) M is metrizable, i.e. there is a distance function d : M × M → [0, ∞)
such that U is the topology induced by d.
(f ) M is paracompact, i.e. every open cover of M has a locally finite
refinement. (An open cover {Vj }j∈J is called locally finite iff every p ∈ M
has a neighborhood that intersects only finitely many Vj .)

102

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

That (a) implies (e) follows from the Urysohn Metrization Theorem
which asserts (in its original form) that every normal second countable topological space is metrizable [51, Theorem 34.1]. A topological space M is
called normal iff points are closed and, for any two disjoint closed sets
A, B ⊂ M , there are disjoint open sets U, V ⊂ M such that A ⊂ U and
B ⊂ V . It is called regular iff points are closed and, for every closed set
A ⊂ M and every b ∈ M \ A, there are disjoint open sets U, V ⊂ M such
that A ⊂ U and b ∈ V . It is called locally compact iff, for every open
set U ⊂ M and every p ∈ U , there is a compact neighborhood of p contained in U . It is easy to show that every manifold is locally compact and
every locally compact Hausdorff space is regular. Tychonoff ’s Lemma
asserts that a regular topological space with a countable base is normal [51,
Theorem 32.1]. Hence it follows from the Urysohn Metrization Theorem
that every Hausdorff manifold with a countable base is metrizable. That (e)
implies (f) follows from a more general theorem which asserts that every
metric space is paracompact (see [51, Theorem 41.4] and [62]). Conversely,
the Smirnov Metrization Theorem asserts that a paracompact Hausdorff space is metrizable if and only if it is locally metrizable, i.e. every
point has a metrizable neighborhood (see [51, Theorem 42.1]). Since every manifold is locally metrizable this shows that (f) implies (e). Thus we
have (a) =⇒ (e) ⇐⇒ (f) for every Hausdorff manifold.
The proof that (f) implies (a) does not require the Hausdorff property
but we do need the assumption that M is connected. (A manifold with
uncountably many connected components, each of which is paracompact, is
itself paracompact but does not admit a countable atlas.) Here is a sketch.
If M is a paracompact manifold, then there is a locally finite open cover
{Uα }α∈A by coordinate charts. Since each set Uα has a countable dense
subset, the set {α ∈ A | Uα ∩ Uα0 ̸= ∅} is at most countable for each α0 ∈ A.
Since M is connected we can reach each point from Uα0 through a finite
sequence of sets Uα1 , . . . , Uαℓ with Uαi−1 ∩ Uαi ̸= ∅. This implies that the
index set A is countable and hence M admits a countable atlas.
Remark 2.9.3. A Riemann surface is a 1-dimensional complex manifold
(i.e. the coordinate charts take values in C and the transition maps are
holomorphic) with a Hausdorff topology. It is a deep theorem in the theory
of Riemann surfaces that every connected Riemann surface is necessarily
second countable (see [2]). Thus pathological examples of the type discussed
in Example 2.8.10 cannot be constructed with holomorphic transition maps.

Exercise 2.9.4. Prove that every manifold is locally compact. Find an example of a manifold M and a point p0 ∈ M such that every closed neighborhood of p0 is non-compact. Hint: The example is necessarly non-Hausdorff.
Exercise 2.9.5. Prove that a manifold M admits a countable atlas if and
only if it is σ-compact if and only if every open cover of M has a countable
subcover if and only if it is second countable. Hint: The topology of Rm is
second countable and every open subset of Rm is σ-compact.
Exercise 2.9.6. Prove that every submanifold M ⊂ Rk (Definition 2.1.3)
is second countable.
Exercise 2.9.7. Prove that every connected component of a manifold M is
an open subset of M and is path-connected.

2.9.2

Partitions of Unity

Definition 2.9.8 (Partition of unity). Let M be a smooth manifold. A
partition of unity on M is a collection of smooth functions
θα : M → [0, 1],

α ∈ A,

such that each point p ∈ M has an open neighborhood V ⊂ M on which only
finitely many θα do not vanish, i.e.
# {α ∈ A | θα |V ̸≡ 0} < ∞,

(2.9.1)

and, for every p ∈ M , we have
X

θα (p) = 1.

(2.9.2)

α∈A

If {Uα }α∈A is an open cover of M , then a partition of unity {θα }α∈A (indexed
by the same set A) is called subordinate to the cover iff each θα is
supported in Uα , i.e.
supp(θα ) := {p ∈ M | θα (p) ̸= 0} ⊂ Uα .
Theorem 2.9.9 (Partitions of unity). Let M be a smooth manifold whose
topology is paracompact and Hausdorff. Then, for every open cover of M ,
there exists a partition of unity subordinate to that cover.
The proof requires two preparatory lemmas.

104

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Lemma 2.9.10. Let M be a smooth manifold with a Hausdorff topology.
Then, for every open set V ⊂ M and every compact set K ⊂ V , there exists
a smooth function κ : M → [0, ∞) with compact support such that κ(p) > 0
for every p ∈ K and supp(κ) ⊂ V .
Proof. Assume first that K = {p0 } is a single point. Since M is a manifold it is locally compact. Hence there is a compact neighborhood C ⊂ V
of p0 . Since M is Hausdorff C is closed and hence the set U := int(C)
is a neighborhood of p0 whose closure U ⊂ C is compact and contained
in V . Shrinking U , if necessary, we may assume that there is a coordinate
chart ϕ : U → Ω with values in some open neighborhood Ω ⊂ Rm of the
origin such that ϕ(p0 ) = 0. (Here m is the dimension of M .) Now choose a
smooth function κ0 : Ω → [0, ∞) with compact support such that κ0 (0) > 0.
Then the function κ : M → [0, 1], defined by κ|U := κ0 ◦ ϕ and κ(p) := 0
for p ∈ M \ U is supported in V and satisfies κ(p0 ) > 0. This proves the
lemma in the case where K is a point.
Now let K be any compact subset of V . Then, by the first part of
the proof, there is a collection of smooth functions κp : M → [0, ∞),
one for every p ∈ K, such that κp (p) > 0 and supp(κp ) ⊂ V . Since K
is compact
there are finitely many points p1 , . . . , pk ∈ K P
such that the

sets p ∈ M | κpj (p) > 0 cover K. Hence the function κ := j κpj is supported in V and is everywhere positive on K. This proves Lemma 2.9.10.
Lemma 2.9.11. Let M be a topological space. If {Vi }i∈I is a locally finite
collection of open sets in M , then
[

To prove the converse choose a point p0 ∈ M \ i∈I0 V i . Since the collection {Vi }i∈I is locally finite, there exists an open neighborhood U of p0 such
that the set I1 := {i ∈ I | Vi ∩ U ̸= ∅} is finite. Hence the set
U0 := U \

[

Vi

i∈I0 ∩I1

of p0 and we have U0 ∩ Vi = ∅ for every i ∈ I0 .

Hence p0 ∈

2.9. CONSEQUENCES OF PARACOMPACTNESS*

105

Proof of Theorem 2.9.9. Let {Uα }α∈A be an open cover of M . We prove in
four steps that there is a partition of unity subordinate to this cover. The
proofs of steps one and two are taken from [51, Lemma 41.6].
Step 1. There is a locally finite open cover {Vi }i∈I of M such that, for
every i ∈ I, the closure V i is compact and contained in one of the sets Uα .
Denote by V ⊂ 2M the set of all open sets V ⊂ M such that V is compact
and V ⊂ Uα for some α ∈ A. Since M is a locally compact Hausdorff
space the collection V is an open cover of M . (If p ∈ M , then there is an
α ∈ A such that p ∈ Uα ; since M is locally compact there is a compact
neighborhood K ⊂ Uα of p; since M is Hausdorff K is closed and thus
V := int(K) is an open neighborhood of p with V ⊂ K ⊂ Uα .) Since M is
paracompact the open cover V has a locally finite refinement {Vi }i∈I . This
cover satisfies the requirements of Step 1.
Step 2. There S
is a collection of compact sets Ki ⊂ Vi , one for each i ∈ I,
such that M = i∈I Ki .
Denote by W ⊂ 2M the set of all open sets W ⊂ M such that W ⊂ Vi for
some i. Since M is a locally compact Hausdorff space, the collection W is an
open cover of M . Since M is paracompact W has a locally finite refinement
{Wj }j∈J . By the axiom of choice there is a map
J → I : j 7→ ij
such that
W j ⊂ V ij

∀ j ∈ J.

Since the collection {Wj }j∈J is locally finite, we have
Ki :=

[
ij =i

Wj =

[

W j ⊂ Vi

ij =i

by Lemma 2.9.11. Since V i is compact so is Ki .
Step 3. There is a partition of unity subordinate to the cover {Vi }i∈I .
Choose a collection of compact sets Ki ⊂ Vi for i ∈ I as in Step 2. Then,
by Lemma 2.9.10 and the axiom of choice, there is a collection of smooth
functions κi : M → [0, ∞) with compact support such that
supp(κi ) ⊂ Vi ,

κi |Ki > 0

∀ i ∈ I.

106

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Since the cover {Vi }i∈I is locally finite the sum
κ :=

X

κi : M → R

i∈I

is locally finite (i.e. each point in M has a neighborhood in which only
finitely many terms do not vanish) and thus defines a smooth function on M .
This function is everywhere positive, because each summand is nonnegative
and, for each p ∈ M , there is an i ∈ I with p ∈ Ki so that κi (p) > 0. Thus
the funtions χi := κi /κ define a partition of unity satisfying supp(χi ) ⊂ Vi
for every i ∈ I as required.
Step 4. There is a partition of unity subordinate to the cover {Uα }α∈A .
Let {χi }i∈I be the partition of unity constructed in Step 3. By the axiom
of choice there is a map I → A : i 7→ αi such that Vi ⊂ Uαi for every i ∈ I.
For α ∈ A define θα : M → [0, 1] by
θα :=

X

χi .

αi =α

Here the sum runs over all indices i ∈ I with αi = α. This sum is locally
finite and hence is a smooth function on M . Moreover, each point in M has
an open neighborhood in which only finitely many of the θα do not vanish.
Hence the sum of the θα is a well defined function on M and
X

θα =

X X

χi =

α∈A αi =α

χi ≡ 1.

This shows that the functions θα form a partition of unity. To prove the
inclusion supp(θα ) ⊂ Uα we consider the open sets
Wi := {p ∈ M | χi (p) > 0}
for i ∈ I. Since Wi ⊂ Vi this collection is locally finite.
Lemma 2.9.11, we have
supp(θα ) =

Wi =

This proves Theorem 2.9.9.

Embedding in Euclidean Space

Theorem 2.9.12. Let M be a second countable smooth m-manifold with a
Hausdorff topology. Then there exists an embedding f : M → R2m+1 with a
closed image.
Proof. The proof has five steps.
Step 1. Let U ⊂ M be an open set and let K ⊂ U be a compact set.
Then there exists an integer k ∈ N, a smooth map f : M → Rk , and an
open set V ⊂ M , such that K ⊂ V ⊂ U , the restriction f |V : V → Rk is an
injective immersion, and f (p) = 0 for all p ∈ M \ U .
Choose a smooth atlas A = {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A on M such that, for each α ∈ A,
either Uα ⊂ U or Uα ∩ K = ∅. Since M is a paracompact Hausdorff manifold, Theorem 2.9.9 asserts that there exists a partition of unity {θα }α∈A subordinate to the open cover {Uα }α∈A of M . Since the sets {p ∈ Uα | θα (p) > 0}
with Uα ⊂ U form an open cover of K and K is a compact subset of M ,
there exist finitely many indices α1 , . . . , αℓ ∈ A such that

K ⊂ p ∈ M θα1 (p) + · · · + θαℓ (p) > 0 =: V ⊂ U.
Let k := ℓ(m + 1) and, for i = 1, . . . , ℓ, abbreviate
ϕi := ϕαi ,

θi := θαi .

Define the smooth map f : M → Rk by


f (p) := 

θℓ (p)
θℓ (p)ϕℓ (p)

for p ∈ M.

Then the restriction f |V : V → Rk is injective. Namely, if p0 , p1 ∈ V satisfy
f (p0 ) = f (p1 ),
then


I := i θi (p0 ) > 0 = i θi (p1 ) > 0 ̸= ∅
and, for i ∈ I, we have θi (p0 ) = θi (p1 ), hence ϕi (p0 ) = ϕi (p1 ), and so p0 = p1 .
Moreover, for every p ∈ V the derivative df (p) : Tp M → Rk is injective, and
this proves Step 1.

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Step 2. Let f : M → Rk be an injective immersion and let A ⊂ R(2m+1)×k
be a nonempty open set. Then there exists a matrix A ∈ A such that the
map Af : M → R2m+1 is an injective immersion.
The proof of Step 2 uses the Theorem of Sard (see [1, 50]). The sets

W0 := (p, q) ∈ M × M p ̸= q ,

W1 := (p, v) ∈ T M v ̸= 0
are open subsets of smooth second countable Hausdorff 2m-manifolds and
the maps
F0 : A × W0 → R2m+1 ,

F1 : A × W1 → R2m+1 ,

defined by
F0 (A, p, q) := A(f (p) − f (q)),

F1 (A, p, v) := Adf (p)v

for A ∈ A, (p, q) ∈ W0 , and (p, v) ∈ W1 , are smooth. Moreover, the zero
vector in R2m+1 is a regular value of F0 because f is injective and of F1
because f is an immersion. Hence it follows from the intrinsic analogue of
Theorem 2.2.19 that the sets

M0 := F0−1 (0) = (A, p, q) ∈ A × W0 Af (p) = Af (q) ,

M1 := F1−1 (0) = (A, p, v) ∈ A × W1 Adf (p)v = 0
are smooth manifolds of dimension
dim M0 = dim M1 = (2m + 1)k − 1.
Since M is a second countable Hausdorff manifold, so are M0 and M1 .
Hence the Theorem of Sard asserts that the canonical projections
M0 → A : (A, p, q) 7→ A =: π0 (A, p, q),
M1 → A : (A, p, v) 7→ A =: π1 (A, p, v),
have a common regular value A ∈ A. Since
dim M0 = dim M1 < dim A,
this implies
A ∈ A \ (π0 (M0 ) ∪ π1 (M1 )) .
Hence Af : M → R2m+1 is an injective immersion and this proves Step 2.

If M is compact, the result follows from Steps 1 and 2 with K = U = M .
In the noncompact case the proof requires two more steps to construct an
embedding into R4m+4 and a further step to reduce the dimension to 2m + 1.
Step 3. Assume M is not compact. Then there exists a sequence of open
sets Ui ⊂ M , a sequence of smooth functions ρi : M → [0, 1], and a sequence
of compact sets Ki ⊂ Ui such that
supp(ρi ) ⊂ Ui ,

Ki = ρ−1
i (1) ⊂ Ui ,

for all i, j ∈ N with |i − j| ≥ 2 and M =

Ui ∩ Uj = ∅

S∞

i=1 Ki .

Since M is second countable, there exists a sequenceSof compact sets Ci ⊂ M
such that Ci ⊂ int(Ci+1 ) for all i ∈ N and M = i∈N Ci (Remark 2.9.1).
Define the compact sets Bi ⊂ M by C0 := ∅ and
Bi := Ci \ Ci−1
Then M =

S

for i ∈ N.

i∈N Bi and, for all i, j ∈ N with j ≥ i + 2, we have

Bi ⊂ Ci ⊂ int(Cj−1 ),

Bj ⊂ Cj \ int(Cj−1 )

and so Bi ∩ Bj = ∅. Since M is metrizable by Remark 2.9.2, there exists
a distance function d : M × M → [0, ∞) that induces the intrinsic topology
on M . Define
[
Ai :=
Bj ,
εi := d(Ai , Bi ) =
inf
d(p, q).
j∈N\{i−1,i,i+1}

p∈Ai ,q∈Bi

Then Ai is a closed subset of M , because any convergent sequence in M must
belong to a finite union of the Bj . Since Ai ∩ Bi = ∅, this implies εi > 0.
For i ∈ N define the set Ui ⊂ M by

Ui := p ∈ M there exists a q ∈ Bi with d(p, q) < εi /3 .
Then {Ui }i∈N is a sequence of open subsets of M such that Bi ⊂ Ui ⊂ Ci+1
for all i ∈ N and Ui ∩ Uj = ∅ for |i − j| ≥ 2. In particular, each set Ui has a
compact closure.
For each i there exists of a partition of unity subordinate to the open
cover M = Ui ∪ (M \ Bi ) and hence a smooth function ρi : M → [0, 1] such
that supp(ρi ) ⊂ Ui and ρi |Bi ≡ 1. Define Ki := ρ−1
i (1) = {p ∈ Ui | ρi (p) = 1}
for i ∈ N. Then
Ki is a compact set and Bi ⊂ Ki ⊂ Ui for each i ∈ N.
S
Hence M = i∈N Ki and this proves Step 3.

derivative dgi (p) : Tp M → R2m+1 is injective for all p ∈ Ki and all i ∈ N.

supp(fi ) ⊂ Ui ,

fi (Ki ) ⊂ B1 (iξ),

fi (M ) ⊂ Bi+1 (0).

Now let p0 , p1 ∈ M such that f (p0 ) = f (p1 ). Assume
first that p0 ∈ K2i−1 .
S
odd
odd
Then ρ (p1 ) = ρ (p0 ) = 1 and hence p1 ∈ j∈N K2j−1 . By (2.9.5), we
also have 2i − 2 < |f odd (p1 )| = |f odd (p0 )| < 2i and hence p1 ∈ K2i−1 . This
implies f2i−1 (p1 ) = f odd (p1 ) = f odd (p0 ) = f2i−1 (p0 ) and so p0 =S
p1 . Now
assume p0 ∈ K2i . Then ρev (p1 ) = ρev (p0 ) = 1 and hence p1 ∈ j∈N K2j .
By (2.9.5), we also have 2i − 1 < |f ev (p1 )| = |f ev (p0 )| < 2i + 1, so p1 ∈ K2i ,
which implies f2i (p1 ) = f ev (p1 ) = f ev (p0 ) = f2i (p0 ), and so again p0 = p1 .
This shows that f is injective. That f is an immersion follows from the fact
that the derivative dfi (p) is injective for all p ∈ Ki and all i ∈ N.
We prove that f is proper and has a closed image. Let (pν )ν∈N be a
sequence in M such that the sequence (f (pν ))ν∈N in R4m+4 is bounded.
Choose i ∈S
N such that |f odd (pν )| < 2i and |f ev (pν )| < 2i + 1 for all ν ∈ N.
Then pν ∈ 2i
j=1 Kj for all ν ∈ N by (2.9.5). Hence (pν )ν∈N has a convergent
subsequence. Thus f : M → R4m+4 is an embedding with a closed image.
Next consider the pair of orthonormal vectors
x := (0, ξ, 0, 0),

y := (0, 0, 0, ξ)

in R4m+4 = R × R2m+1 × R × R2m+1 . Let (pν )ν∈N be a sequence in M
that does not have a convergent subsequence and choose a sequence iν ∈ N
such that pν ∈ K2iν −1 ∪ K2iν for all ν ∈ N. Then iν tends to infinity.
If pν ∈ K2iν −1 for all ν, then we have lim supν→∞ |f odd (pν )|−1 |f ev (pν )| ≤ 1
by (2.9.5). Passing to a subsequence, still denoted by (pν )ν∈N , we may
assume that the limit λ := limν→∞ |f odd (fν )|−1 |f ev (pν )| exists. Then

Similarly, if pν ∈ K2iν for all ν, there exists a subsequence such that the

This shows that the vectors x and y satisfy the requirements of Step 4.
Step 5. There exists an embedding f : M → R2m+1 with a closed image.
For compact manifolds the result was proved in Steps 1 and 2 and for m = 0
the assertion is obvious, because then M is a finite or countable set with
the discrete topology. Thus assume that M is not compact and m ≥ 1.
Choose f : M → R4m+4 and x, y ∈ R4m+4 as in Step 4 and define

A := A ∈ R(2m+1)×(4m+4)

Since m ≥ 1, this is a nonempty open subset of R(2m+1)×(4m+4) . We prove
that the map Af : M → R2m+1 is proper and has a closed image for every A ∈ A. To see this, fix a matrix A ∈ A. Let (pν )ν∈N be a sequence in M
that does not have a convergent subsequence. Then by Step 4 there exists a
subsequence, still denoted by (pν )ν∈N , and real numbers s, t ∈ R such that
s2 + t2 = 1,

f (pν )

lim |f (pν )| = ∞.

ν→∞

This implies
Af (pν )

ν→∞ |f (pν )|
and hence limν→∞ |Af (pν )| = ∞. Thus the preimage of every compact subset of R2m+1 under the map Af : M → R2m+1 is a compact subset of M ,
and hence Af is proper and has a closed image (Remark 2.3.3).
Now it follows from Step 2 that there exists a matrix A ∈ A such that the
map Af : M → R2m+1 is an injective immersion. Hence it is an embedding
with a closed image. This proves Step 5 and Theorem 2.9.12.

The Whitney Embedding Theorem asserts that every second countable Hausdorff m-manifold M admits an embedding f : M → R2m . The
proof is based on the Whitney Trick and goes beyond the scope of this
book. The next exercise shows that Whitney’s theorem is sharp.
Remark 2.9.13. The manifold RP2 cannot be embedded into R3 . The same
is true for the Klein bottle K := R2 / ≡ where the equivalence relation is
given by [x, y] ≡ [x + k, ℓ − y] for x, y ∈ R and k, ℓ ∈ Z.

Leaves of a Foliation

Let M be an m-dimensional paracompact Hausdorff manifold and E ⊂ T M
be an integrable subbundle of rank n. Let L ⊂ M be a closed leaf of the
foliation determined by E. Then L is a smooth n-dimensional submanifold
of M . Here is a sketch of David Epstein’s proof of this fact in [19].
(a) The space L with the intrinsic topology admits the structure of a manifold such that the obvious inclusion ι : L → M is an injective immersion.
This is an easy exercise. For the definition of the intrinsic topology see
Exercise 2.7.10. The dimension of L is n.
(b) If f : X → Y is a continuous map between topological spaces such that Y
is paracompact and there is an open cover {Vj }j∈J of Y such that f −1 (Vj )
is paracompact for each j, then X is paracompact. To see this, we may
assume that the cover {Vj }j∈J is locally finite. Now let {Uα }α∈A be an open
cover of X. Then the sets Uα ∩ f −1 (Vj ) define an open cover of f −1 (Vj ).
Choose a locally finite refinement {Wij }i∈Ij of this cover. Then the open
cover {Wij }j∈J, i∈Ij of M is a locally finite refinement of {Uα }α∈A .
(c) The intrinsic topology of L is paracompact. This follows from (b) and
the fact that the intersection of L with every foliation box is paracompact
in the intrinsic topology.
(d) The intrinsic topology of L is second countable. This follows from (a)
and (c) and the fact that every connected paracompact manifold is second
countable (see Remark 2.9.2).
(e) The intersection of L with a foliation box consists of at most countably
many connected components. This follows immediately from (d).
(f ) If L is a closed subset of M , then the intersection of L with a foliation
box has only finitely many connected components. To see this, we choose
a transverse slice of the foliation at p0 ∈ L, i.e. a connected submanifold
T ⊂ M through p0 , diffeomorphic to an open ball in Rm−n , whose tangent
space at each point p ∈ T is a complement of Ep . By (d) we have that T ∩ L
is at most countable. If this set is not finite, even after shrinking T , there
must be a sequence pi ∈ (T ∩L)\{p0 } converging to p0 . Using the holonomy
of the leaf (obtained by transporting transverse slices along a curve via a
lifting argument) we find that every point p ∈ T ∩ L is the limit point of a
sequence in (T ∩ L) \ {p}. Hence the one-point set {p} has empty interior in
the relative topology of T ∩ L for each p ∈ T ∩ L. Thus T ∩ L is a countable
union of closed subsets with empty interior. Since T ∩L admits the structure
of a complete metric space, this contradicts the Baire category theorem.
(g) It follows immediately from (f) that L is a submanifold of M .

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Principal Bundles

An interesting class of foliations arises from smooth Lie group actions.
Let G ⊂ GL(N, R) be a compact Lie group and let P be a smooth mmanifold whose topology is Hausdorff and second countable. A smooth
(contravariant) G-action on P is a smooth map
P × G → P : (p, g) 7→ pg

(2.9.6)

that satisfies the conditions
(pg)h = p(gh),

p1l = p

(2.9.7)

for all p ∈ P and all g, h ∈ G. Fix any such group action. Then every
group element g ∈ G determines a diffeomorphism P → P : p 7→ pg, whose
derivative at p ∈ P is denoted by Tp P → Tpg P : v 7→ vg. Every Lie algebra element ξ ∈ g := Lie(G) = T1l G determines a vector field Xξ ∈ Vect(P )
which assigns to each p ∈ P the tangent vector
Xξ (p) := pξ :=

d
p exp(tξ) ∈ Tp P.
dt t=0

(2.9.8)

The linear map g → Vect(P ) : ξ 7→ Xξ is called the infinitesimal action.
It is a Lie algebra anti-homomorphism because the group action is contravariant. (Exercise: Prove that [Xξ , Xη ] = −X[ξ,η] for ξ, η ∈ g.) The group
action (2.9.6) is said to be with finite isotropy iff the isotropy subgroup
Gp := {g ∈ G | pg = p}
is finite for all p ∈ P . The isotropy subgroup Gp is a Lie subgroup of G
with Lie algebra gp := Lie(Gp ) = {ξ ∈ g | Xξ (p) = 0}. Since G is compact,
this shows that Gp is a finite subgroup of G if and only if gp = {0}
or, equivalently, the map g → Tp P : ξ 7→ Xξ (p) = pξ is injective. Thus, in
the finite isotropy case, the group action determines an involutive subbundle E ⊂ T P with the fibers Ep := pg = {Xξ (p) | ξ ∈ g} for p ∈ P . When G
is connected, the leaves of the corresponding foliation are the group orbits pG := {pg | g ∈ G}. These are the elements of the orbit space
P/G := {pG | p ∈ P } .
There is a natural projection π : P → P/G defined by π(p) := pG for p ∈ P
and the orbit space P/G is equipped with the quotient topology (a subset U ⊂ P/G is open if and only if π −1 (U ) is an open subset of P ). The
group action is called free iff Gp = {1l} for all p ∈ P . The next theorem
shows that, in the case of a free action, the quotient space admits a unique
smooth structure such that the projection π : P → P/G is a submersion.

2.9. CONSEQUENCES OF PARACOMPACTNESS*

Theorem 2.9.14 (Principal Bundle). Let P be a smooth m-manifold
whose topology is Hausdorff and second countable. Suppose P is equipped
with a smooth contravariant action of a compact Lie group G and assume
the group action is free. Then dim(G) ≤ m and B := P/G admits a unique
smooth structure such that the projection π : P → B is a submersion. The
intrinsic topology of B, induced by the smooth structure, agrees with the
quotient topology, and it is Hausdorff and second countable.
Proof. For each p ∈ P the map G → P : g 7→ pg is an embedding and this
implies k := dim(G) ≤ dim(P ) = m. Define n := m − k. A local slice of
the group action is a smooth map ι : Ω → P , defined on an open set Ω ⊂ Rn ,
such that the map Ω × G → P : (x, g) 7→ ι(x)g is an embedding. With this
understood, we prove the assertions in five steps.
Step 1. For every p0 ∈ P there exists a local slice ι0 : Ω0 → P , defined on
an open neighborhood Ω0 ⊂ Rn of the origin, such that ι0 (0) = p0 .
Choose a coordinate chart ϕ : V → Rm on an open neighborhood V ⊂ P
of p0 such that ϕ(p0 ) = 0 and ϕ(V ) = Rm . Define v1 , . . . , vm ∈ Tp0 P by
dϕ(p0 )vi := ei

for i = 1, . . . , m,

where e1 , . . . , em is the standard basis of Rm . Reorder the coordinates
on Rm , if necessary, such that the vectors v1 , . . . , vn project to a basis of the
quotient space Tp0 P/p0 g. Define ι : Rn → P by
ι(x1 , . . . , xn ) := ϕ−1 (x1 , . . . , xn , 0, . . . , 0)
and define the map ψ : Rn × G → P by
ψ(x, g) := ι(x)g

for x ∈ Rn and g ∈ G.

Then ψ is smooth and its derivative dψ(0, 1l) : Rn × g → Tp0 P is given by
dψ(0, 1l)(b
x, ξ) =

n
X

x
bi vi + p0 ξ

i=1

for x
b = (b
x1 , . . . , x
bn ) ∈ Rn and ξ ∈ g. Hence dψ(0, 1l) is bijective and so it
follows from the Inverse Function Theorem 2.2.17 that there exist open
neighborhoods Ω ⊂ Rn of 0, Ω1 ⊂ G of 1l, and W ⊂ P of p0 such that the
restricted map
ψ1 := ψ|Ω×Ω1 : Ω × Ω1 → W
is a diffeomorphism.

116

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Next we prove that there exists an open neigborhood Ω0 ⊂ Ω of the
origin such that the restricted map
ψ0 := ψ|Ω0 ×G : Ω0 × G → P
is injective. Suppose otherwise that no such neighborhood Ω0 exists. Then
there exist sequences (xi , gi ), (x′i , gi′ ) ∈ Ω × G such that (xi , gi ) ̸= (x′i , gi′ )
and ψ(xi , gi ) = ψ(x′i , gi′ ) for all i and the sequences (xi )i∈N and (x′i )i∈N in Ω
converge to the origin. Since G is compact we may assume, by passing to
a subsequence if necessary, that the sequences (gi )i∈N and (gi′ )i∈N converge.
Denote the limits by
g := lim gi ∈ G,
i→∞

g ′ := lim gi′ ∈ G.
i→∞

Then
p0 g = lim ι(xi )gi = lim ι(x′i )gi′ = p0 g ′
i→∞

i→∞

and so g = g ′ because the group action is free. Thus the sequence (gi′ gi−1 )i∈N
in G converges to 1l and hence belongs to the set Ω1 for i sufficiently large.
Since
ψ1 (xi , 1l) = ι(xi ) = ι(x′i )gi′ gi−1 = ψ1 (x′i , gi′ gi−1 )
for all i, this contradicts the injectivity of ψ1 . Thus we have proved that
the map ψ0 : Ω0 × G → P is injective for a suitable neighborhood Ω0 ⊂ Ω
of the origin. That it is an immersion is a direct consequence of the formula


dψ0 (x, g)(b
x, gb) = dι(x)b
x + ι(x)(b
g g −1 ) g = dψ0 (x, 1l)(b
x, gbg −1 ) g
for all x ∈ Ω0 , x
b ∈ Rn , g ∈ G, and gb ∈ Tg G, and the fact that the derivative dψ0 (x, 1l) is bijective for all x ∈ Ω0 (even for all x ∈ Ω).
Thus we have proved that ψ0 : Ω0 × G → P is an injective immersion.
Shrinking Ω0 further, if necessary, we may assume that Ω0 has a compact
closure and that ψ is injective on Ω0 × G. This implies that ψ0 is proper.
Namely, if (xi , gi )i∈N is a sequence in Ω0 × G and (x, g) ∈ Ω0 × G such
that ψ0 (x, g) = limi→∞ ψ0 (xi , gi ), then there is a subsequence (xiν , giν )ν∈N
that converges to a pair (x′ , g ′ ) ∈ Ω0 × G. This subsequence satisfies
ψ(x′ , g ′ ) = lim ψ0 (xiν , giν ) = ψ(x, g).
ν→∞

Since ψ is injective on Ω0 × G, this implies x = x′ and g = g ′ . Thus
every subsequence of (xi , gi )i∈N has a further subsequence that converges
to (x, g) and so the sequence (xi , gi )i∈N itself converges to (x, g). Thus the
map ψ0 : Ω0 × G → P is a proper injective immersion and this proves Step 1.

2.9. CONSEQUENCES OF PARACOMPACTNESS*

Step 2. Let ι : Ω → P be a local slice. Then the set U := π(ι(Ω)) ⊂ B is
open in the quotient topology and the map π ◦ ι : Ω → U is a homeomorphism
with respect to the quotient topology on U .
The map ψ : Ω × G → P , defined by ψ(x, g) := ι(x)g for x ∈ Ω and g ∈ G,
is an embedding. Hence W := ψ(Ω × G) is an open G-invariant subset
of P and ψ : Ω × G → W is a G-equivariant homeomorphism. Moreover,
for every element p ∈ P , we have π(p) ∈ U if and only if there exists
an element x ∈ Ω and an element g ∈ G such that p = ι(x)g = ψ(x, g).
Thus π −1 (U ) = ψ(Ω × G) = W is an open subset of P , and so U is an open
subset of B = P/G with respect to the quotient topology. The continuity
of π ◦ ι : Ω → U follows directly from the definition. Moreover, if Ω′ ⊂ Ω is
an open set and U ′ := π(ι(Ω′ )), then π −1 (U ′ ) = ψ(Ω′ × G) is open by the
same argument, and so U ′ ⊂ B is open with respect to the quotient topology.
Thus π ◦ ι : Ω → U is a homeomorphism and this proves Step 2.
Step 3. By Step 1 there exists a collection ια : Ωα → P , α ∈ A, of local
slices such that the sets Uα := π(ια (Ωα )) cover the orbit space B = P/G.
For α ∈ A define
ϕα := (π ◦ ια )−1 : Uα → Ωα .
Then A = {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A is a smooth structure on B which renders the
canonical projection π : P → B into a submersion. Moreover, this smooth
structure is compatible with the quotient topology on B.
For α, β ∈ A define Ωαβ := ϕα (Uα ∩ Uβ ) and ϕβα := ϕβ ◦ ϕ−1
α : Ωαβ → Ωβα .
We must prove that ϕβα is smooth. To see this, define ψα : Ωα × G → P
by ψα (x, g) := ια (x)g for α ∈ A, x ∈ Ωα , and g ∈ G. Then ψα is a diffeomorphism onto its image and ψα (Ωαβ × G) = ψβ (Ωβα × G) = π −1 (Uα ∩ Uβ ).
For x ∈ Ωαβ the element ϕβα (x) ∈ Ωβα is the projection of ψβ−1 ◦ ψα (x, 1l)
onto the first factor. Thus ϕβα is smooth and so is its inverse ϕαβ . This
shows that {(Uα , ϕα )}α∈A is a smooth structure on B. Second, π is a submersion with respect to this smooth structure, because ϕα ◦ π ◦ ψα (x, g) = x
for all α ∈ A, all x ∈ Ωα , and all g ∈ G. Third, this smooth structure is compatible with the quotient topology by Step 2. This proves Step 3.
Step 4. There is only one smooth structure on B with respect to which the
projection π : P → B is a submersion.
Fix any smooth structure on B for which the projection π : P → B is a
submersion. Then the dimension of B is n = dim(P ) − dim(G), and so the
smooth structure consists of bijections ϕα : Uα → Ωα from subsets Uα ⊂ B
onto open sets Ωα ⊂ Rn such that the sets Uα cover B and the transition
maps are diffeomorphisms between open subsets of Rn .

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

We prove that the intrinsic topology on B agrees with the quotient topology. To see this, fix a subset U ⊂ B. Then the following are equivalent.
(a) U is open with respect to the intrinsic topology on B.
(b) ϕα (U ∩ Uα ) is open in Rn for all α ∈ A.
(c) π −1 (U ∩ Uα ) is open in P for all α ∈ A.
(d) π −1 (U ) is open in P .
(e) U is open with respect to the quotient topology on B.
The equivalence of (a) and (b) follows from the definition of the intrinsic
topology. That (b) implies (c) follows from the three observations that the
set π −1 (Uα ) is open in P , the map ϕα ◦ π : π −1 (Uα ) → Ωα is continuous,
and (ϕα ◦ π)−1 (ϕα (U ∩ Uα )) = π −1 (U ∩ Uα ). That (c) implies (b) follows
from the fact that the map ϕα ◦ π : π −1 (Uα ) → Ωα is a submersion and hence
maps the open set π −1 (U ∩ Uα ) onto an open subset of Ωα (Corollary 2.6.2).
The equivalence of (c) and (d) follows from the fact that the map π : P → B
is continuous and Uα ⊂ B is open (both with respect to the intrinsic topology
on B) and so π −1 (Uα ) is open in P for all α ∈ A. The equivalence of (d)
and (e) follows from the definition of the quotient topology on B.
Now let ι : Ω → P be a local slice and define the set U := π(ι(Ω)) ⊂ B
and the map ϕ := (π ◦ ι)−1 : U → Ω. Then the composition
ϕα ◦ ϕ−1 = ϕα ◦ π ◦ ι : ϕ(U ∩ Uα ) → ϕα (U ∩ Uα )
is a homeomorphism between open subsets of Rn . Moreover, ϕα ◦ ϕ−1 is the
composition of the smooth maps ι : {x ∈ Ω | π(ι(x)) ∈ Uα } → π −1 (U ∩ Uα ),
π : π −1 (U ∩ Uα ) → U ∩ Uα , and ϕα : U ∩ Uα → ϕα (U ∩ Uα ). So ϕα ◦ ϕ−1 is
smooth and its derivative is everywhere bijective because π is a submersion
and the kernel of dπ(ι(x)) is transverse to the image of dι(x). Thus ϕα ◦ ϕ−1
is a diffeomorphism by the Inverse Function Theorem and this proves Step 4.
Step 5. The quotient topology on B is a Hausdorff and second countable.
Let ια : Ωα → P for α ∈ A be a collection of local slices such that the
sets Uα := π(ια (Ωα )) cover B. Then the open sets π −1 (Uα ) form an open
cover of P and so there is a countable subcover. Thus B is second countable. To prove that B is Hausdorff, fix two distinct elements b0 , b1 ∈ B and
choose p0 , p1 ∈ P such that π(p0 ) = b0 and π(p1 ) = b1 . Then p0 G and p1 G
are disjoint compact subsets of P and hence can be separated by disjoint
open subsets U0 , U1 ⊂ P , because P is a Hausdorff space. Now for i = 0, 1
the set Vi := {p ∈ P | pG ⊂ Ui } is open (exercise) and contains the orbit pi G.
Hence W0 := π(V0 ) and W1 := π(V1 ) are disjoint open subsets of B such
that b0 ∈ W0 and b1 ∈ W1 . This proves Step 5 and Theorem 2.9.14.

2.9. CONSEQUENCES OF PARACOMPACTNESS*

119

Example 2.9.15. There are many important examples of free group actions
and principal bundles. A class of examples arises from orthonormal frame
bundles (§3.4). The complex projective space B = CPn arises from the
action of the circle G = S 1 on the unit sphere P = S 2n+1 ⊂ Cn+1 (Example 2.8.5). The real projective space B = RPn arises from the action of the
finite group G = Z/2Z on the unit sphere P = S n ⊂ Rn+1 (Example 2.8.6).
The complex Grassmannian B = Gk (Cn ) arises from the action of G = U(k)
on the space P = Fk (Cn ) of unitary k-frames in Cn (Example 3.7.6). If G is
a Lie group and K ⊂ G is a compact subgroup, then by Theorem 2.9.14 the
homogeneous space G/K admits a unique smooth structure such that the
projection π : G → G/K is a submersion. The example SL(2, C)/SU(2) can
be identified with hyperbolic 3-space (§6.4.3), the example U(n)/O(n) can
be identified with the space of Lagrangian subspaces of a symplectic vector
space ([49, Lemma 2.3.2]), the example Sp(2n)/U(n) can be identified with
Siegel upper half space or the space of compatible linear complex structures
on a symplectic vector space (Exercise 6.5.24 and [49, Lemma 2.5.12]), and
the example G2 /SO(4) can be identified with the associative Grassmannian ([68, Remark 8.4]).

Standing Assumption
We have seen that all the results in the present chapter carry over to the
intrinsic setting, assuming that the topology of M is Hausdorff and paracompact. In fact, in many cases it is enough to assume the Hausdorff property.
However, these results mainly deal with introducing the basic concepts such
as smooth maps, embeddings, submersions, vector fields, flows, and verifying
their elementary properties, i.e. with setting up the language for differential geometry and topology. When it comes to the substance of the subject
we shall deal with Riemannian metrics and they only exist on paracompact
Hausdorff manifolds. Another central ingredient in differential topology is
the theorem of Sard and that requires second countability. To quote Moe
Hirsch [29]: “Manifolds that are not paracompact are amusing, but they
never occur naturally and it is difficult to prove anything about them.”
Thus we will set the following convention for the remaining chapters.
We assume from now on that each intrinsic manifold M
is Hausdorff and second countable and hence is also paracompact.
For most of this text we will in fact continue to develop the theory for
submanifolds of Euclidean space and indicate, wherever necessary, how to
extend the definitions, theorems, and proofs to the intrinsic setting.

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS

Chapter 3

The Levi-Civita Connection
For a submanifold of Euclidean space the inner product on the ambient space
determines an inner product on each tangent space, the first fundamental
form. The second fundamental form is obtained by differentiating the map
which assigns to each point in M ⊂ Rn the orthogonal projection onto the
tangent space (§3.1). The covariant derivative of a vector field along a curve
is the orthogonal projection of the derivative in the ambient space onto the
tangent space (§3.2). We will show how the covariant derivative gives rise
to parallel transport (§3.3), examine the frame bundle (§3.4), discuss motions without “sliding, twisting, and wobbling”, and prove the development
theorem (§3.5).
In §3.6 we will see that the covariant derivative is determined by the
Christoffel symbols in local coordinates and thus carries over to the intrinsic setting. The intrinsic setting of Riemannian manifolds is explained
in §3.7. The covariant derivative takes the form of a family of linear operators ∇ : Vect(γ) → Vect(γ), one for every smooth curve γ : I → M , and
these operators are uniquely characterized by the axioms of Theorem 3.7.8.
This family of linear operators is the Levi-Civita connection.

3.1

Second Fundamental Form

Let M ⊂ Rn be a smooth m-manifold. Then each tangent space of M is an
m-dimensional real vector space and hence is isomorphic to Rm . Thus any
two tangent spaces Tp M and Tq M are of course isomorphic to each other.
While there is no canonical isomorphism from Tp M to Tq M we shall see
that every smooth curve γ in M connecting p to q induces an isomorphism
between the tangent spaces via parallel transport of tangent vectors along γ.
121

122

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION
Throughout we use the standard inner product on Rn given by
⟨v, w⟩ = v1 w1 + v2 w2 + · · · + vn wn

for v = (v1 , . . . , vn ) ∈ Rn and w = (w1 , . . . , wn ) ∈ Rn . The associated Euclidean norm will be denoted by
q
p
|v| = ⟨v, v⟩ = v12 + v22 + · · · + vn2
for v = (v1 , . . . , vn ) ∈ Rn . When M ⊂ Rn is a smooth m-dimensional submanifold, a first observation is that each tangent space of M inherits an inner
product from the ambient space Rn . The resulting field of inner products is
called the first fundamental form.
Definition 3.1.1. Let M ⊂ Rn be a smooth m-dimensional submanifold.
The first fundamental form on M is the field which assigns to each p ∈ M
the bilinear map
gp : Tp M × Tp M → R
defined by
gp (v, w) = ⟨v, w⟩

(3.1.1)

for v, w ∈ Tp M .
A second observation is that the inner product on the ambient space also
determines an orthogonal projection of Rn onto the tangent space Tp M for
each p ∈ M . This projection can be represented by the matrix Π(p) ∈ Rn×n
which is uniquely determined by the conditions
Π(p) = Π(p)2 = Π(p)T ,

(3.1.2)

⇐⇒

(3.1.3)

and
Π(p)v = v

v ∈ Tp M

for p ∈ M and v ∈ Rn (see Exercise 2.6.9).
Lemma 3.1.2. The map Π : M → Rn×n defined by (3.1.2) and (3.1.3) is
smooth.
Proof. This follows directly from Theorem 2.6.10 and Corollary 2.6.12. More
explicitly, if U ⊂ M is an open set and ϕ : U → Ω is a coordinate chart onto
an open subset Ω ⊂ Rm with the inverse ψ := ϕ−1 : Ω → U , then

−1
Π(p) = dψ(ϕ(p)) dψ(ϕ(p))T dψ(ϕ(p))

for p ∈ U and this proves Lemma 3.1.2.

Example 3.1.3 (Gauß map). Let M ⊂ Rm+1 be a submanifold of codimension one. Then T M ⊥ is a vector bundle of rank one (Corollary 2.6.13),
and so each fiber Tp M ⊥ is spanned by a unit vector ν(p) ∈ Rm , determined
by Tp M up to a sign. By Theorem 2.6.10 each p0 ∈ M has an open neighborhood U ⊂ M on which there exists a smooth map
ν : U → Rm+1
satisfying
ν(p) ⊥ Tp M,

|ν(p)| = 1

(3.1.4)

for all p ∈ U (see Figure 3.1). Such a map ν is called a Gauß map. The
function Π : M → Rn×n is in this case given by
Π(p) = 1l − ν(p)ν(p)T

for p ∈ U .

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Example 3.1.6. Let U ⊂ Rn be an open set and f : U → Rn−m be a smooth
function such that 0 ∈ Rn−m is a regular value of f and U ∩ M = f −1 (0).
Then Tp M = ker df (p) and

−1
df (p)
Π(p) = 1l − df (p)T df (p)df (p)T
for every p ∈ U ∩ M .

embedding. Then Tψ(x) M = im dψ(x) and

−1
Π(ψ(x)) = dψ(x) dψ(x)T dψ(x)
dψ(x)T
for every x ∈ Ω.
Next we differentiate the map Π : M → Rn×n in Lemma 3.1.2. The
derivative at p ∈ M takes the form of a linear map
dΠ(p) : Tp M → Rn×n
which, as usual, is defined by
dΠ(p)v :=

d
Π(γ(t)) ∈ Rn×n
dt t=0

for v ∈ Tp M , where γ : R → M is chosen such that γ(0) = p and γ̇(0) = v
(see Definition 2.2.13). We emphasize that the expression dΠ(p)v is a matrix
and can therefore be multiplied by a vector in Rn .
Lemma 3.1.8. For all p ∈ M and v, w ∈ Tp M we have


dΠ(p)v w = dΠ(p)w v ∈ Tp M ⊥ .
Proof. Choose a smooth path γ : R → M and a vector field X : R → Rn
along γ such that
γ(0) = p,

γ̇(0) = v,

X(0) = w.

For example, we can choose X(t) := Π(γ(t))w. Then
X(t) = Π(γ(t))X(t)
for every t ∈ R. Differentiate this equation to obtain

Ẋ(t) = Π(γ(t))Ẋ(t) + dΠ(γ(t))γ̇(t) X(t).

(3.1.6)

Hence


dΠ(γ(t))γ̇(t) X(t) = 1l − Π(γ(t)) Ẋ(t) ∈ Tγ(t) M ⊥
for every t ∈ R and, with t = 0, we obtain (dΠ(p)v) w ∈ Tp M ⊥ .

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Example 3.1.10. Let M ⊂ Rm+1 be an m-manifold and ν : M → S m be
a Gauß map so that Tp M = ν(p)⊥ for every p ∈ M (see Example 3.1.3).
Then Π(p) = 1l − ν(p)ν(p)T and hence
hp (v, w) = −ν(p)⟨dν(p)v, w⟩

Exercise 3.1.11. Choose a splitting Rn = Rm × Rn−m and write the elements of Rn as tuples (x, y) = (x1 , . . . , xm , y1 , . . . , yn−m ) Let M ⊂ Rn be a
smooth m-dimensional submanifold such that p = 0 ∈ M and
T0 M = Rm × {0},

T0 M ⊥ = {0} × Rn−m .

By the implicit function theorem, there are open neighborhoods Ω ⊂ Rm
and V ⊂ Rn−m of zero and a smooth map f : Ω → V such that
M ∩ (Ω × V ) = graph(f ) = {(x, f (x)) | x ∈ Ω} .
Thus f (0) = 0 and df (0) = 0. Prove that the second fundamental form

3.2

Covariant Derivative

Definition 3.2.1. Let I ⊂ R be an open interval and let γ : I → M be a
smooth curve. A vector field along γ is a smooth map X : I → Rn such
that X(t) ∈ Tγ(t) M for every t ∈ I (see Figure 3.2). The set of smooth vector
fields along γ is a real vector space and will be denoted by

Vect(γ) := X : I → Rn | X is smooth and X(t) ∈ Tγ(t) M ∀ t ∈ I .
The first derivative Ẋ(t) of a vector field along γ at t ∈ I will, in general,
not be tangent to M . We may decompose it as a sum of a tangent vector
and a normal vector in the form

Ẋ(t) = Π(γ(t))Ẋ(t) + 1l − Π(γ(t)) Ẋ(t),
where Π : M → Rn×n is defined by (3.1.2) and (3.1.3). The tangential
component of this decomposition plays an important geometric role. It is
called the covariant derivative of X at t.
Definition 3.2.2 (Covariant derivative). Let I ⊂ R be an open interval, let γ : I → M be a smooth curve, and let X ∈ Vect(γ). The covariant
derivative of X is the vector field ∇X ∈ Vect(γ), defined by
∇X(t) := Π(γ(t))Ẋ(t) ∈ Tγ(t) M

(3.2.1)

for t ∈ I.
Lemma 3.2.3 (Gauß–Weingarten formula). The derivative of a vector
field X along a curve γ is given by
Ẋ(t) = ∇X(t) + hγ(t) (γ̇(t), X(t)).

(3.2.2)

Here the first summand is tangent to M and the second summand is orthogonal to the tangent space of M at γ(t).
Proof. This is equation (3.1.6) in the proof of Lemma 3.1.8.

128

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

It follows directly from the definition that the covariant derivative along
a curve γ : I → M is a linear operator ∇ : Vect(γ) → Vect(γ). The following
lemma summarizes the basic properties of this operator.
Lemma 3.2.4 (Covariant derivative). The covariant derivative satisfies
the following axioms for any two open intervals I, J ⊂ R.
(i) Let γ : I → M be a smooth curve, let λ : I → R be a smooth function,
and let X ∈ Vect(γ). Then
∇(λX) = λ̇X + λ∇X.

(3.2.3)

(ii) Let γ : I → M be a smooth curve, let σ : J → I be a smooth function
and let X ∈ Vect(γ). Then
∇(X ◦ σ) = σ̇(∇X ◦ σ).

(3.2.4)

(iii) Let γ : I → M be a smooth curve and let X, Y ∈ Vect(γ). Then

⟨X, Y ⟩ = ⟨∇X, Y ⟩ + ⟨X, ∇Y ⟩.

(3.2.5)

(iv) Let γ : I × J → M be a smooth map, denote by ∇s the covariant derivative along the curve s 7→ γ(s, t) (with t fixed), and denote by ∇t the covariant
derivative along the curve t 7→ γ(s, t) (with s fixed). Then
∇s ∂t γ = ∇t ∂s γ.

(3.2.6)

d
Proof. Part (i) follows from the Leibniz rule dt
(λX) = λ̇X + λẊ and (ii)
d
follows from the chain rule dt (X ◦ σ) = σ̇(Ẋ ◦ σ). To prove part (iii), use
the orthogonal projections Π(γ(t)) : Rn → Tγ(t) M to obtain

d
⟨X, Y ⟩ = ⟨Ẋ, Y ⟩ + ⟨X, Ẏ ⟩
dt
= ⟨Ẋ, Π(γ)Y ⟩ + ⟨Π(γ)X, Ẏ ⟩
= ⟨Π(γ)Ẋ, Y ⟩ + ⟨X, Π(γ)Ẏ ⟩
= ⟨∇X, Y ⟩ + ⟨X, ∇Y ⟩.
Part (iv) holds because the second derivatives commute and this proves
Lemma 3.2.4.
Part (i) in Lemma 3.2.4 asserts that the operator ∇ is what is called a
connection, part (iii) asserts that it is compatible with the first fundamental
form, and part (iv) asserts that it is torsion-free. Theorem 3.7.8 below asserts that these conditions (together with an extended chain rule) determine
the covariant derivative uniquely.

3.3. PARALLEL TRANSPORT

3.3

129

Parallel Transport

Definition 3.3.1 (Parallel vector field). Let I ⊂ R be an interval and
let γ : I → M be a smooth curve. A vector field X along γ is called parallel
iff
∇X(t) = 0
for all t ∈ I.
Example 3.3.2. Assume m = n so that M ⊂ Rm is an open set. Then a
vector field along a smooth curve γ : I → M is a smooth map X : I → Rm .
Its covariant derivative is equal to the ordinary derivative ∇X(t) = Ẋ(t)
and hence X is is parallel if and only if it is constant.
Remark 3.3.3. For every X ∈ Vect(γ) and every t ∈ I we have
∇X(t) = 0

⇐⇒

Ẋ(t) ⊥ Tγ(t) M.

In particular, γ̇ is a vector field along γ and ∇γ̇(t) = Π(γ(t))γ̈(t). Hence γ̇
is a parallel vector field along γ if and only if γ̈(t) ⊥ Tγ(t) M for all t ∈ I.
We will return to this observation in Chapter 4.
In general, a vector field X along a smooth curve γ : I → M is parallel
if and only if Ẋ(t) is orthogonal to Tγ(t) M for every t and, by the Gauß–
Weingarten formula (3.2.2), we have
∇X = 0

⇐⇒

Ẋ = hγ (γ̇, X).

The next theorem shows that any given tangent vector v0 ∈ Tγ(t0 ) M extends
uniquely to a parallel vector field along γ.
Theorem 3.3.4 (Existence and uniqueness). Let I ⊂ R be an interval
and γ : I → M be a smooth curve. Let t0 ∈ I and v0 ∈ Tγ(t0 ) M be given.
Then there is a unique parallel vector field X ∈ Vect(γ) such that X(t0 ) = v0 .
Proof. Choose a basis e1 , . . . , em of the tangent space Tγ(t0 ) M and let
X1 , . . . , Xm ∈ Vect(γ)
be vector fields along γ such that
Xi (t0 ) = ei ,

i = 1, . . . , m.

(For example choose Xi (t) := Π(γ(t))ei .) Then the vectors Xi (t0 ) are linearly independent. Since linear independence is an open condition there is a

130

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

constant ε > 0 such that the vectors X1 (t), . . . , Xm (t) ∈ Tγ(t) M are linearly
independent for every t ∈ I0 := (t0 − ε, t0 + ε) ∩ I. Since Tγ(t) M is an
m-dimensional real vector space this implies that the vectors Xi (t) form a
basis of Tγ(t) M for every t ∈ I0 . We express the vector ∇Xi (t) ∈ Tγ(t) M in
this basis and denote the coefficients by aki (t) so that
∇Xi (t) =

The resulting functions aki : I0 → R are smooth. Likewise, if X : I → Rn is
any vector field along γ, then there are smooth functions ξ i : I0 → R such
that

Thus we have translated the equation ∇X = 0 over the interval I0 into a time
dependent linear ordinary differential equation. By a theorem in Analysis II
(see [64, Lemma 4.4.3]), this equation has a unique solution for any initial
condition at any point in I0 . Thus we have proved that every t0 ∈ I is

3.3. PARALLEL TRANSPORT

131

contained in an interval I0 ⊂ I, open in the relative topology of I, such
that, for every t1 ∈ I0 and every v1 ∈ Tγ(t1 ) M , there exists a unique parallel
vector field X : I0 → Rn along γ|I0 satisfying X(t1 ) = v1 . We formulate this
condition on the interval I0 as a logical formula:
∀ t1 ∈ I0 ∀ v1 ∈ Tγ(t1 ) M ∃! X ∈ Vect(γ|I0 )
such that ∇X = 0 and X(t1 ) = v1 .

(3.3.1)

If two I-open intervals I0 , I1 ⊂ I satisfy this condition and have nonempty
intersection, then their union I0 ∪ I1 also satisfies (3.3.1). (Prove this!) Now
define
[
J :=
{I0 ⊂ I | I0 is an I-open interval, I0 satisfies (3.3.1), t0 ∈ I0 } .
This interval J satisfies (3.3.1). Moreover, it is nonempty and, by definition, it is open in the relative topology of I. We prove that it is also
closed in the relative topology of I. Thus let (ti )i∈N be a sequence in J
converging to a point t∗ ∈ I. By what we have proved above, there exists a constant ε > 0 such that the interval I ∗ := (t∗ − ε, t∗ + ε) ∩ I satisfies (3.3.1). Since the sequence (ti )i∈N converges to t∗ , there exists an i ∈ N
such that ti ∈ I ∗ . Since ti ∈ J there exists an interval I0 ⊂ I, open in the
relative topology of I, that contains t0 and ti and satisfies (3.3.1). Hence
the interval I0 ∪ I ∗ is open in the relative topology of I, contains t0 and t∗ ,
and satisfies (3.3.1). This shows that t∗ ∈J. Thus we have proved that the
interval J is nonempty, and open and closed in the relative topology of I.
Hence J = I and this proves Theorem 3.3.4.
Definition 3.3.5 (Parallel transport). Let I ⊂ R be an interval and
let γ : I → M be a smooth curve. For t0 , t ∈ I we define the map
Φγ (t, t0 ) : Tγ(t0 ) M → Tγ(t) M
by Φγ (t, t0 )v0 := X(t) where X ∈ Vect(γ) is the unique parallel vector field
along γ satisfying X(t0 ) = v0 . The collection of maps Φγ (t, t0 ) for t, t0 ∈ I
is called parallel transport along γ.
Recall the notation

γ ∗ T M = (s, v) | s ∈ I, v ∈ Tγ(s) M
for the pullback tangent bundle. This set is a smooth submanifold of I ×Rn .
(See Theorem 2.6.10 and Corollary 2.6.13.) The next theorem summarizes
the properties of parallel transport. In particular, the last assertion shows
that the covariant derivative can be recovered from the parallel transport
maps.

132

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Theorem 3.3.6 (Parallel transport). Let γ : I → M be a smooth curve
on an interval I ⊂ R.
(i) The map Φγ (t, s) : Tγ(s) M → Tγ(t) M is linear for all s, t ∈ I.
(ii) For all r, s, t ∈ I we have
Φγ (t, s) ◦ Φγ (s, r) = Φγ (t, r),

Φγ (t, t) = id.

(iii) For all s, t ∈ I and all v, w ∈ Tγ(s) M we have
⟨Φγ (t, s)v, Φγ (t, s)w⟩ = ⟨v, w⟩.
Thus Φγ (t, s) : Tγ(s) M → Tγ(t) M is an orthogonal transformation.
(iv) If J ⊂ R is an interval and σ : J → I is a smooth map, then
Φγ◦σ (t, s) = Φγ (σ(t), σ(s)).
for all s, t ∈ J.
(v) The map
I × γ ∗ T M → γ ∗ T M : (t, (s, v)) 7→ (t, Φγ (t, s)v)
is smooth.
(vi) For all X ∈ Vect(γ) and t, t0 ∈ I we have
d
Φγ (t0 , t)X(t) = Φγ (t0 , t)∇X(t).
dt
Proof. Assertion (i) holds because the sum of two parallel vector fields
along γ is again parallel and the product of a parallel vector field with a
constant real number is again parallel. Assertion (ii) follows directly from
the uniqueness statement in Theorem 3.3.4.
We prove (iii). Fix a number s ∈ I and two tangent vectors
v, w ∈ Tγ(s) M.
Define the vector fields X, Y ∈ Vect(γ) along γ by
X(t) := Φγ (t, s)v,

Y (t) := Φγ (t, s)w.

These vector fields are parallel. Thus, by equation (3.2.5) in Lemma 3.2.4,
we have
d
⟨X, Y ⟩ = ⟨∇X, Y ⟩ + ⟨X, ∇Y ⟩ = 0.
dt
Hence the function I → R : t 7→ ⟨X(t), Y (t)⟩ is constant and this proves (iii).

3.3. PARALLEL TRANSPORT

133

We prove (iv). Fix an element s ∈ J and a tangent vector v ∈ Tγ(σ(s)) M .
Define the vector field X along γ by
X(t) := Φγ (t, σ(s))v
for t ∈ I. Thus X is the unique parallel vector field along γ that satisfies
X(σ(s)) = v.
Denote
e := X ◦ σ : I → Rn
X

γ
e := γ ◦ σ : J → M,

e is a vector field along γ
Then X
e and, by the chain rule, we have
d

X(t) = X(σ(t)) = σ̇(t)Ẋ(σ(t)).
dt
dt
Projecting orthogonally onto the tangent space Tγ(σ(t)) M we obtain
e
∇X(t)
= σ̇(t)∇X(σ(t)) = 0
e is the unique parallel vector field along γ
for every t ∈ J. Hence X
e that
e
satisfies X(s)
= v. Thus
e
Φγe (t, s)v = X(t)
= X(σ(t)) = Φγ (σ(t), σ(s))v.
This proves (iv).
We prove (v). Fix a point t0 ∈ I, choose an orthonormal basis e1 , . . . , em
of Tγ(t0 ) M , and define Xi (t) := Φγ (t, t0 )ei for t ∈ I and i = 1, . . . , m. Thus
Xi ∈ Vect(γ) is the unique parallel vector field along γ such that Xi (t0 ) = ei .
Then by (iii) we have
⟨Xi (t), Xj (t)⟩ = δij
for all i, j ∈ {1, . . . , m} and all t ∈ I. Hence the vectors X1 (t), . . . , Xm (t)
form an orthonormal basis of Tγ(t) M for every t ∈ I. This implies that, for
each s ∈ I and each tangent vector v ∈ Tγ(s) M , we have
v=

m
X

⟨Xi (s), v⟩Xi (s).

i=1

Since each vector field Xi is parallel it satisfies Xi (t) = Φγ (t, s)Xi (s). Hence
Φγ (t, s)v =

m
X

⟨Xi (s), v⟩Xi (t)

i=1

for all s, t ∈ I and v ∈ Tγ(s) M . This proves (v).

(3.3.2)

134

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

We prove (vi). Let X1 , . . . , Xm ∈ Vect(γ) be as in the proof of (v). Thus
every vector field X along γ can be written in the form
X(t) =

m
X

ξ i (t)Xi (t),

ξ i (t) := ⟨Xi (t), X(t)⟩.

i=1

Since the vector fields Xi are parallel we have
∇X(t) =

X

ξ˙i (t)Xi (t)

i=1

for all t ∈ I. Hence
Φγ (t0 , t)X(t) =

m
X

ξ i (t)Xi (t0 ),

Φγ (t0 , t)∇X(t) =

i=1

m
X

ξ˙i (t)Xi (t0 ).

i=1

Evidently, the derivative of the first sum with respect to t is equal to the
second sum. This proves (vi) and Theorem 3.3.6.
Remark 3.3.7. For s, t ∈ I we can think of the linear map
Φγ (t, s)Π(γ(s)) : Rn → Tγ(t) M ⊂ Rn
as a real n × n matrix. The formula (3.3.2) in the proof of (v) shows that
this matrix can be expressed in the form
Φγ (t, s)Π(γ(s)) =

m
X

Xi (t)Xi (s)T ∈ Rn×n .

i=1

The right hand side defines a smooth matrix valued function on I × I and
this is equivalent to the assertion in (v).
Remark 3.3.8. It follows from assertions (ii) and (iii) in Theorem 3.3.6
that
Φγ (t, s)−1 = Φγ (s, t) = Φγ (t, s)∗
for all s, t ∈ I. Here the linear map Φγ (t, s)∗ : Tγ(t) M → Tγ(s) M is understood as the adjoint operator of Φγ (t, s) : Tγ(s) M → Tγ(t) M with respect to
the inner products on the two subspaces of Rn inherited from the Euclidean
inner product on the ambient space.

3.3. PARALLEL TRANSPORT

135

The two theorems in this section carry over verbatim to any smooth
vector bundle E ⊂ M × Rn over a manifold. As in the case of the tangent
bundle one can define the covariant derivative of a section of E along γ as
the orthogonal projection of the ordinary derivative in the ambient space Rn
onto the fiber Eγ(t) . Instead of parallel vector fields one then speaks about
horizontal sections and one proves as in Theorem 3.3.4 that there is a unique
horizontal section along γ through any point in any of the fibers Eγ(t0 ) . This
gives parallel transport maps from Eγ(s) to Eγ(t) for any pair s, t ∈ I and
Theorem 3.3.6 carries over verbatim to all vector bundles E ⊂ M × Rn . We
spell this out in more detail in the case where E = T M ⊥ ⊂ M × Rn is the
normal bundle of M .
Let γ : I → M be a smooth curve. A normal vector field along γ is
a smooth map Y : I → Rn such that Y (t) ⊥ Tγ(t) M for every t ∈ I. The set
of normal vector fields along γ will be denoted by

Vect⊥ (γ) := Y : I → Rn | Y is smooth and Y (t) ⊥ Tγ(t) M for all t ∈ I .
This is again a real vector space. The covariant derivative of a normal
vector field Y ∈ Vect⊥ (γ) at t ∈ I is defined as the orthogonal projection of
the ordinary derivative onto the orthogonal complement of Tγ(t) M and will
be denoted by

∇⊥ Y (t) := 1l − Π(γ(t)) Ẏ (t).
(3.3.3)
Thus the covariant derivative defines a linear operator
∇⊥ : Vect⊥ (γ) → Vect⊥ (γ).
There is a version of the Gauß–Weingarten formula for the covariant derivative of a normal vector field. This is the content of the next lemma.
Lemma 3.3.9. Let M ⊂ Rn be a smooth m-manifold. For p ∈ M and
u ∈ Tp M define the linear map hp (u) : Tp M → Tp M ⊥ by

hp (u)v := hp (u, v) = dΠ(p)u v
(3.3.4)
for v ∈ Tp M . Then the following holds.
(i) The adjoint operator hp (u)∗ : Tp M ⊥ → Tp M is given by

hp (u)∗ w = dΠ(p)u w,
w ∈ Tp M ⊥ .

(3.3.5)

(ii) If I ⊂ R is an interval, γ : I → M is a smooth curve, and Y ∈ Vect⊥ (γ),
then the derivative of Y satisfies the Gauß–Weingarten formula
Ẏ (t) = ∇⊥ Y (t) − hγ(t) (γ̇(t))∗ Y (t).

(3.3.6)

136

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Proof. Since Π(p) ∈ Rn×n is a symmetric matrix for every p ∈ M so is the
matrix dΠ(p)u for every p ∈ M and every u ∈ Tp M . Hence
⟨v, hp (u)∗ w⟩ = ⟨hp (u)v, w⟩

= dΠ(p)u v, w

= v, dΠ(p)u w
for every v ∈ Tp M and every w ∈ Tp M ⊥ . This proves (i).
To prove (ii) we observe that, for Y ∈ Vect⊥ (γ) and t ∈ I, we have
Π(γ(t))Y (t) = 0.
Differentiating this identity we obtain

Π(γ(t))Ẏ (t) + dΠ(γ(t))γ̇(t) Y (t) = 0
and hence

Ẏ (t) = Ẏ (t) − Π(γ(t))Ẏ (t) − dΠ(γ(t))γ̇(t) Y (t)
= ∇⊥ Y (t) − hγ(t) (γ̇(t))∗ Y (t)
for t ∈ I. Here the last equation follows from (i) and the definition of ∇⊥ .
This proves Lemma 3.3.9.
Theorem 3.3.4 and its proof carry over to the normal bundle T M ⊥ .
Thus, if γ : I → M is a smooth curve, then for all s ∈ I and w ∈ Tγ(s) M ⊥
there is a unique normal vector field Y ∈ Vect⊥ (γ) such that
∇⊥ Y ≡ 0,

Y (s) = w.

This gives rise to parallel transport maps
⊥
⊥
Φ⊥
γ (t, s) : Tγ(s) M → Tγ(t) M

defined by
Φ⊥
γ (t, s)w := Y (t)
for s, t ∈ I and w ∈ Tγ(s) M ⊥ , where Y is the unique normal vector field along
γ satisfying ∇⊥ Y ≡ 0 and Y (s) = w. These parallel transport maps satisfy
exactly the same conditions that have been spelled out in Theorem 3.3.6
for the tangent bundle and the proof carries over verbatim to the present
setting.

3.4. THE FRAME BUNDLE

3.4

137

The Frame Bundle

Each tangent space of an m-manifold M is isomorphic to the Euclidean
space Rm , however, in general there is no canonical isomorphism. The space
of all pairs consisting of a point p in the manifold M and an isomorphism
from Rm to the tangent space of M at p is itself a smooth manifold, called
the frame bundle of M .

3.4.1

Frames of a Vector Space

Let V be an m-dimensional real vector space. A frame of V is a basis
e1 , . . . , em of V . It determines a vector space isomorphism e : Rm → V via
eξ :=

m
X

ξ i ei ,

ξ = (ξ 1 , . . . , ξ m ) ∈ Rm .

i=1

Conversely, each isomorphism e : Rm → V determines a basis e1 , . . . , em
of V via ei = e(0, . . . , 0, 1, 0 . . . , 0), where the coordinate 1 appears in the
ith place. The set of vector space isomorphisms from Rm to V will be
denoted by
Liso (Rm , V ) := {e : Rm → V | e is a vector space isomorphism} .
The general linear group GL(m) = GL(m, R) (of nonsingular real m × mmatrices) acts on this space by composition on the right via
GL(m) × Liso (Rm , V ) → Liso (Rm , V ) : (a, e) 7→ a∗ e := e ◦ a.
This is a contravariant group action in that
a∗ b∗ e = (ba)∗ e,

1l∗ e = e

for a, b ∈ GL(m) and e ∈ Liso (Rm , V ). Moreover, the action is free, i.e. for
all a ∈ GL(m) and e ∈ Liso (Rm , V ), we have
a∗ e = e

⇐⇒

a = 1l.

It is transitive in that for all e, e′ ∈ Liso (Rm , V ) there is a group element
a ∈ GL(m) such that e′ = a∗ e. Thus we can identify the space Liso (Rm , V )
with the group GL(m) via the bijection
GL(m) → Liso (Rm , V ) : a 7→ a∗ e0
induced by a fixed element e0 ∈ Liso (Rm , V ). This identification is not
canonical; it depends on the choice of e0 . The space Liso (Rm , V ) admits a
bijection to a group but is not itself a group.

138

3.4.2

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

The Frame Bundle

Definition 3.4.1 (Frame bundle). Let M ⊂ Rn be a smooth m-manifold.
The frame bundle of M is the set
F(M ) := {(p, e) | p ∈ M, e ∈ F(M )p } ,

(3.4.1)

where F(M )p is the space of frames of the tangent space at p, i.e.
F(M )p := Liso (Rm , Tp M ).
Define a right action of GL(m) on F(M ) by
a∗ (p, e) := (p, a∗ e) = (p, e ◦ a)

(3.4.2)

for a ∈ GL(m) and (p, e) ∈ F(M ).
One can think of a frame e ∈ Liso (Rm , Tp M ) as a linear map from Rm
to Rn whose image is Tp M and hence as an n × m-matrix of rank m.
The basis of Tp M associated to this frame is given by the columns of the
matrix e ∈ Rn×m . Thus the frame bundle F(M ) of an embedded manifold M ⊂ Rn is a subset of the Euclidean space Rn × Rn×m .
Lemma 3.4.2. The frame bundle
F(M ) ⊂ Rn × Rn×m
is a smooth manifold of dimension m + m2 , the group action
GL(m) × F(M ) → F(M ) : (a, (p, e)) 7→ a∗ (p, e)
is smooth, and the projection
π : F(M ) → M
defined by π(p, e) := p for (p, e) ∈ F(M ) is a surjective submersion. The
orbits of the GL(m)-action on F(M ) are the fibers of this projection, i.e.
GL(m)∗ (p, e) = π −1 (p) ∼
= F(M )p
for (p, e) ∈ F(M ), and the group GL(m) acts freely and transitively on each
of these fibers.

3.4. THE FRAME BUNDLE

139

Proof. Let U ⊂ M be an M -open set. A moving frame over U is a sequence of m smooth vector fields E1 , . . . , Em ∈ Vect(U ) on U such that the
vectors E1 (p), . . . , Em (p) form a basis of Tp M for each p ∈ U . Any such
moving frame gives a bijection
U × GL(m) → F(U ) : (p, a) 7→ a∗ (p, E(p)) = (p, E(p) ◦ a),
where
E(p) := (E1 (p), . . . , Em (p)) ∈ F(M )p
for p ∈ U . This bijection (when composed with a parametrization of U )
gives a parametrization of the open set F(U ) in F(M ). The assertions of
the lemma then follow from the fact that the diagram

commutes. More precisely, suppose that there exists a coordinate chart
ϕ:U →Ω
with values in an open set Ω ⊂ Rm , and denote its inverse by
ψ := ϕ−1 : Ω → U.
Then the open set
F(U ) = π −1 (U ) = {(p, e) ∈ F(M ) | p ∈ U } = (U × Rn×m ) ∩ F(M )
is parametrized by the map

Ω × GL(m) → F(U ) : (x, a) 7→ ψ(x), dψ(x) ◦ a .
This map is amooth and so is its inverse

F(U ) → Ω × GL(m) : (p, e) 7→ ϕ(p), dϕ(p) ◦ e .
These are the desired coordinate chart on F(M ). Thus F(M ) is a smooth
manifold of dimension m + m2 . Moreover, in these coordinates the projection π : F(U ) → U is the map Ω × GL(m) → Ω : (x, a) 7→ x and so π is a
submersion. The remaining assertions follow directly from the definitions
and this proves Lemma 3.4.2.

140

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

The frame bundle F(M ) is a principal bundle over M with structure group GL(m). More generally, a principal bundle over a manifold B
with structure group G is a smooth manifold P equipped with a surjective
submersion π : P → B and a smooth contravariant action
G × P → P : (g, p) 7→ pg
by a Lie group G such that π(pg) = π(p) for all p ∈ P and g ∈ G and such
that the group G acts freely and transitively on the fiber Pb := π −1 (b) for
each b ∈ B. In this book we shall mostly be concerned with the frame bundle
of a manifold M and the orthonormal frame bundle.
Definition 3.4.3. The orthonormal frame bundle of M is the set
n
o
O(M ) := (p, e) ∈ Rn × Rn×m p ∈ M, im e = Tp M, eT e = 1lm .
If we denote by ei := e(0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) (with 1 as the ith argument) the
basis of Tp M induced by the isomorphism e : Rm → Tp M , then we have
eT e = 1l

⇐⇒

⟨ei , ej ⟩ = δij

⇐⇒

e1 , . . . , em is an
orthonormal basis.

Thus O(M ) is the bundle of orthonormal frames of the tangent spaces Tp M
or the bundle of orthogonal isomorphisms e : Rm → Tp M . It is a principal
bundle over M with structure group O(m).
Exercise 3.4.4. Prove that O(M ) is a submanifold of F(M ) and that the
obvious projection π : O(M ) → M is a submersion. Prove that the action
of GL(m) on F(M ) restricts to an action of the orthogonal group O(m)
on O(M ) whose orbits are the fibers

O(M )p := e ∈ Rn×m (p, e) ∈ O(M )

= e ∈ Liso (Rm , Tp M ) eT e = 1l .
Hint: If ϕ : U → Ω is a coordinate chart on M with inverse ψ : Ω → U ,
then
ex := dψ(x)(dψ(x)T dψ(x))−1/2 : Rm → Tψ(x) M
is an orthonormal frame of the tangent space Tψ(x) M for every x ∈ Ω.

3.4. THE FRAME BUNDLE

3.4.3

141

Horizontal Lifts

We have seen in Lemma 3.4.2 that the frame bundle F(M ) is a smooth
submanifold of Rn × Rn×m . Next we examine the tangent space of F(M ) at
a point (p, e) ∈ F(M ). By Definition 2.2.1, this tangent space is given by


R → F(M ) : t 7→ (γ(t), e(t)) 

T(p,e) F(M ) = (γ̇(0), ė(0)) is a smooth curve satisfying
.


γ(0) = p and e(0) = e
The next lemma gives an explicit formula for this tangent space in terms of
the second fundamental form hp : Tp M × Tp M → Tp M ⊥ in Definition 3.1.9.
Compare this formula with Lemma 4.3.1 in the next chapter.
Lemma 3.4.5. Let M ⊂ Rn be a smooth m-dimensional submanifold. Then
the tangent space of F(M ) at (p, e) is given by
(
)
pb ∈ Tp M, eb ∈ Rn×m , and
T(p,e) F(M ) = (b
p, eb)
.
(3.4.3)
1l − Π(p) eb = hp (b
p)e
Proof. We prove the inclusion “⊂” in (3.4.3). Let (b
p, eb) ∈ T(p,e) F(M ) and
choose a smooth curve R → F(M ) : t 7→ (γ(t), e(t)) such that
γ(0) = p,

e(0) = e,

γ̇(0) = pb,

ė(0) = eb.

Fix a vector ξ ∈ Rm and define the vector field X ∈ Vect(γ) by X(t) := e(t)ξ
for t ∈ R. Then the Gauß–Weingarten formula (3.2.2) asserts that
ė(t)ξ = Ẋ(t)
= ∇X(t) + hγ(t) (γ̇(t), X(t))
= Π(γ(t))ė(t)ξ + hγ(t) (γ̇(t), e(t)ξ)
for all t ∈ R. Take t = 0 to obtain
(1l − Π(p))b
eξ = hp (b
p, eξ) = hp (b
p)eξ
for all ξ ∈ Rm . This proves the inclusion “⊂” in (3.4.3). Equality holds
because both sides of the equation are (m+m2 )-dimensional linear subspaces
of Rn × Rn×m . This proves Lemma 3.4.5.
It is convenient to consider two kinds of curves in F(M ), namely vertical
curves with constant projections to M and horizontal lifts of curves in M .
We denote by L(Rm , Tp M ) the space of linear maps from Rm to Tp M .

142

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Definition 3.4.6 (Horizontal lift). Let γ : R → M be a smooth curve. A
smooth curve β : R → F(M ) is called a lift of γ iff
π ◦ β = γ.
Any such lift has the form β(t) = (γ(t), e(t)) with e(t) ∈ Liso (Rm , Tγ(t) M ).
The associated curve of frames e(t) of the tangent spaces Tγ(t) M is called a
moving frame along γ. A curve
β(t) = (γ(t), e(t)) ∈ F(M )
is called horizontal or a horizontal lift of γ iff the vector field
X(t) := e(t)ξ
along γ is parallel for every ξ ∈ Rm . Thus a horizontal lift of γ has the form
β(t) = (γ(t), Φγ (t, 0)e)

(3.4.4)

for some e ∈ Liso (Rm , Tγ(0) M ).
Lemma 3.4.7. (i) The tangent space of F(M ) at (p, e) ∈ F(M ) is the direct
sum
T(p,e) F(M ) = H(p,e) ⊕ V(p,e)
of the horizontal space

H(p,e) := (v, hp (v)e) v ∈ Tp M

(3.4.5)

and the vertical space
V(p,e) := {0} × L(Rm , Tp M ).

(3.4.6)

(ii) The vertical space V(p,e) at (p, e) ∈ F(M ) is the kernel of the linear map
dπ(p, e) : T(p,e) F(M ) → Tp M.
(iii) A curve β : R → F(M ) is horizontal if and only if it is tangent to the
horizontal spaces, i.e. β̇(t) ∈ Hβ(t) for every t ∈ R.
(iv) If β : R → F(M ) is a horizontal curve, so is a∗ β for every a ∈ GL(m).

3.4. THE FRAME BUNDLE

143

Proof. The proof has four steps.
Step 1. Let (p, e) ∈ F(M ). Then V(p,e) = ker dπ(p, e) ⊂ T(p,e) F(M ).
Since π is a submersion, the fiber π −1 (p) is a submanifold of F(M ) by
Theorem 2.2.19 and T(p,e) π −1 (p) = ker dπ(p, e). Now let (b
p, eb) ∈ ker dπ(p, e).
Then there exists a vertical curve β : R → F(M ) with π ◦ β ≡ p such that
β(0) = (p, e),

β̇(0) = (b
p, eb).

Any such curve has the form β(t) := (p, e(t)) where e(t) ∈ Liso (Rm , Tp M ).
Hence pb = 0 and eb = ė(0) ∈ L(Rm , Tp M ). This shows that
ker dπ(p, e) ⊂ V(p,e) .

(3.4.7)

Conversely, for every eb ∈ L(Rm , Tp M ), the curve
R → L(Rm , Tp M ) : t 7→ e(t) := e + tb
e
takes values in the open set Liso (Rm , Tp M ) for t sufficiently small and
hence β(t) := (p, e(t)) is a vertical curve with β̇(0) = (0, eb). Thus
V(p,e) ⊂ ker dπ(p, e) ⊂ T(p,e) F(M ).

(3.4.8)

Combining (3.4.7) and (3.4.8) we obtain Step 1 and part (ii).
Step 2. Let (p, e) ∈ F(M ). Then H(p,e) ⊂ T(p,e) F(M ). Moreover, every
horizontal curve β : R → F(M ) satisfies β̇(t) ∈ Hβ(t) for all t ∈ R.
Fix a tangent vector v ∈ Tp M , let γ : R → M be a smooth curve satisfying γ(0) = p and γ̇(0) = v, and let β : R → F(M ) be the horizontal lift of γ
with β(0) = (p, e). Then
β(t) = (γ(t), e(t)),

e(t) := Φγ (t, 0)e.

Fix a vector ξ ∈ Rm and consider the vector field
X(t) := e(t)ξ = Φγ (t, 0)eξ
along γ. This vector field is parallel and hence, by the Gauß–Weingarten
formula, it satisfies
ė(0)ξ = Ẋ(0) = hγ(0) (γ̇(0), X(0)) = hp (v)eξ.
Here we have used (3.3.4). Thus
(v, hp (v)e) = (γ̇(0), ė(0)) = β̇(0) ∈ Tβ(0) F(M ) = T(p,e) F(M )
and so H(p,e) ⊂ T(p,e) F(M ). Moreover, β̇(0) = (v, hp (v)e) ∈ H(p,e) = Hβ(0)
and this proves Step 2.

144

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Step 3. We prove part (i).
We have V(p,e) ⊂ T(p,e) F(M ) by Step 1 and H(p,e) ⊂ T(p,e) F(M ) by Step 2.
Moreover H(p,e) ∩ V(p,e) = {0} and so T(p,e) F(M ) = H(p,e) ⊕ V(p,e) for dimensional reasons. This proves Step 3.
Step 4. We prove parts (iii) and (iv).
By Step 2 every horizontal curve β : R → F(M ) satisfies β̇(t) ∈ Hβ(t) . Conversely, let R → F(M ) : t 7→ β(t) = (γ(t), e(t)) be a smooth curve satisfying β̇(t) ∈ Hβ(t) for all t. Then ė(t) = hγ(t) (γ̇(t))e(t) for all t. By the Gauß–
Weingarten formula (3.2.2) this implies that the vector field X(t) = e(t)ξ
along γ is parallel for every ξ ∈ Rm , so β is horizontal. This proves part (iii).
Part (iv) follows from (iii) and the fact that the horizontal tangent bundle H ⊂ T F(M ) is invariant under the induced action of the group GL(m)
on T F(M ). This proves Lemma 3.4.7.

The reason for the terminology introduced in Definition 3.4.6 is that one

hence the word “lift”. The vertical space is tangent to the vertical line in

crude imagery can be extremely helpful.

Exercise 3.4.8. The group GL(m) acts on F(M ) by diffeomorphisms. Thus
for each a ∈ GL(m) the map
F(M ) → F(M ) : (p, e) 7→ a∗ (p, e) = (p, e ◦ a)
is a diffeomorphism of F(M ). The derivative of this diffeomorphism is a
diffeomorphism of the tangent bundle T F(M ) and this is called the induced
action of GL(m) on T F(M ). Prove that the horizontal and vertical subbundles are invariant under the induced action of GL(m) on T F(M ).
Exercise 3.4.9. Prove that H(p,e) ⊂ T(p,e) O(M ) and that

The following definition introduces an important class of vector fields on
the frame bundle that will play a central role in Section 3.5. They will be
used to prove the Development Theorem 3.5.21 in §3.5.4 below.
Definition 3.4.10 (Basic vector field). Every vector ξ ∈ Rm determines
a vector field Bξ ∈ Vect(F(M )) defined by

Bξ (p, e) := eξ, hp (eξ)e
(3.4.9)
for (p, e) ∈ F(M ). This vector field is horizontal, i.e.
Bξ (p, e) ∈ H(p,e) ,
and projects to eξ, i.e.
dπ(p, e)Bξ (p, e) = eξ
for all (p, e) ∈ F(M ). These two conditions determine the vector field Bξ
uniquely. It is called the basic vector field corresponding to ξ.
Exercise 3.4.11. (i) Prove that every basic vector field Bξ ∈ Vect(F(M ))
is tangent to the orthonormal frame bundle O(M ).
(ii) Let R → F(M ) : t 7→ (γ(t), e(t)) be an integral curve of the vector
field Bξ and a ∈ GL(m). Prove that R → F(M ) : t 7→ a∗ β(t) = (γ(t), a∗ e(t))
is an integral curve of Ba−1 ξ .
(iii) Prove that the vector field Bξ ∈ Vect(F(M )) is complete for all ξ ∈ Rm
if and only if the restricted vector field Bξ |O(M ) ∈ Vect(O(M )) on the orthonormal frame bundle is complete for all ξ ∈ Rm .
Definition 3.4.12 (Complete manifold). A smoth m-manifold M ⊂ Rn
is called complete iff, for every smooth curve ξ : R → Rm and every
element (p0 , e0 ) ∈ F(M ), there exists a smooth curve β : R → F(M ) such
that β(0) = (p0 , e0 ) and β̇(t) = Bξ(t) (β(t)) for all t ∈ R.

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Motions and Developments

Our aim in this sections is to define motion without sliding, twisting, or
wobbling. This is the motion that results when a heavy object is rolled,
with a minimum of friction, along the floor. It is also the motion of the large
snowball a child creates as it rolls it into the bottom part of a snowman.
We shall eventually justify mathematically the physical intuition that
either of the curves of contact in such ideal rolling may be specified arbitrarily; the other is then determined uniquely. Thus for example the heavy
object may be rolled along an arbitrary curve on the floor; if that curve is
marked in wet ink, another curve will be traced in the object. Conversely,
if a curve is marked in wet ink on the object, the object may be rolled so as
to trace a curve on the floor. However, if both curves are prescribed, it will
be necessary to slide the object as it is being rolled, if one wants to keep the
curves in contact.
We assume throughout this section that M and M ′ are two m-dimensional submanifolds of Rn . Objects on M ′ will be denoted by the same letter
as the corresponding objects on M with primes affixed. Thus for example
Π′ (p′ ) ∈ Rn×n denotes the orthogonal projection of Rn onto the tangent
space Tp′ M ′ , ∇′ denotes the covariant derivative of a vector field along a
curve in M ′ , and Φ′γ ′ denotes parallel transport along a curve in M ′ .

3.5.1

Motion

Definition 3.5.1. A motion of M along M ′ (on an interval I ⊂ R) is
a triple (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) of smooth maps
Ψ : I → O(n),

γ : I → M,

γ′ : I → M ′

such that
Ψ(t)Tγ(t) M = Tγ ′ (t) M ′

∀ t ∈ I.

Note that a motion also matches normal vectors, i.e.
Ψ(t)Tγ(t) M ⊥ = Tγ ′ (t) M ′

⊥

∀ t ∈ I.

Remark 3.5.2. Associated to a motion (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) of M along M ′ is a family
of (affine) isometries ψt : Rn → Rn defined by

ψt (p) := γ ′ (t) + Ψ(t) p − γ(t)
(3.5.1)
for t ∈ I and p ∈ Rn . These isometries satisfy
ψt (γ(t)) = γ ′ (t),

dψt (γ(t))Tγ(t) M = Tγ ′ (t) M ′

∀ t ∈ I.

3.5. MOTIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS

147

Remark 3.5.3. There are three operations on motions.
Reparametrization. If (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) is a motion of M along M ′ on an interval I ⊂ R and σ : J → I is a smooth map between intervals, then the
triple
(Ψ ◦ σ, γ ◦ σ, γ ′ ◦ σ)
is a motion of M along M ′ on the interval J.
Inversion. If (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) is a motion of M along M ′ , then
(Ψ−1 , γ ′ , γ)
is a motion of M ′ along M .
Composition. If (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) is a motion of M along M ′ on an interval I
and (Ψ′ , γ ′ , γ ′′ ) is a motion of M ′ along M ′′ on the same interval, then
(Ψ′ Ψ, γ, γ ′′ )
is a motion of M along M ′′ .
We now give the three simplest examples of “bad” motions; i.e. motions
which do not satisfy the concepts we are about to define. In all three of
these examples, p is a point of M and M ′ is the affine tangent space to M
at p:
M ′ := p + Tp M = {p + v | v ∈ Tp M } .
Example 3.5.4 (Pure sliding). Take a nonzero tangent vector v ∈ Tp M
and let
γ(t) := p,
γ ′ (t) = p + tv,
Ψ(t) := 1l.
Then γ̇(t) = 0, γ̇ ′ (t) = v ̸= 0, and so
Ψ(t)γ̇(t) ̸= γ̇ ′ (t).
(See Figure 3.4.)

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Example 3.5.5 (Pure twisting). Let γ and γ ′ be the constant curves
γ(t) = γ ′ (t) = p
and take Ψ(t) to be the identity on Tp M ⊥ and any curve of rotations on the
tangent space Tp M . As a concrete example with m = 2 and n = 3 one can
take M to be the sphere of radius one centered at the point (0, 1, 0) and p
to be the origin:

M := (x, y, z) ∈ R3 | x2 + (y − 1)2 + z 2 = 1 ,

p := (0, 0, 0).

Then M ′ is the (x, z)-plane and A(t) is any curve of rotations in the (x, z)plane, i.e. about the y-axis Tp M ⊥ . (See Figure 3.5.)

Example 3.5.6 (Pure wobbling). This is the same as pure twisting except
that Ψ(t) is the identity on Tp M and any curve of rotations on Tp M ⊥ . As
a concrete example with m = 1 and n = 3 one can take M to be the circle
of radius one in the (x, y)-plane centered at the point (0, 1, 0) and p to be
the origin:

M := (x, y, 0) ∈ R3 | x2 + (y − 1)2 = 1 ,

p := (0, 0, 0).

Then M ′ is the x-axis and Ψ(t) is any curve of rotations in the (y, z)-plane,
i.e. about the axis M ′ . (See Figure 3.6.)

Sliding

When a train slides on the track (e.g. in the process of stopping suddenly),
there is a terrific screech. Since we usually do not hear a screech, this means
that the wheel moves along without sliding. In other words the velocity of
the point of contact in the train wheel M equals the velocity of the point
of contact in the track M ′ . But the track is not moving; hence the point of
contact in the wheel is not moving. One may explain the paradox this way:
the train is moving forward and the wheel is rotating around the axle. The
velocity of a point on the wheel is the sum of these two velocities. When
the point is on the bottom of the wheel, the two velocities cancel.
Definition 3.5.7. A motion (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) is said to be without sliding iff it
satisfies Ψ(t)γ̇(t) = γ̇ ′ (t) for every t.
Here is the geometric picture of the no sliding condition. As explained
in Remark 3.5.2 we can view a motion as a smooth family of isometries

ψt (p) := γ ′ (t) + Ψ(t) p − γ(t)
acting on the manifold M with γ(t) ∈ M being the point of contact with M ′ .
Differentiating the curve t 7→ ψt (p) which describes the motion of the point
p ∈ M in the space Rn we obtain

d
ψt (p) = γ̇ ′ (t) − Ψ(t)γ̇(t) + Ψ̇(t) p − γ(t) .
dt
Taking p = γ(t0 ) we find
d
ψt (γ(t0 )) = γ̇ ′ (t0 ) − Ψ(t0 )γ̇(t0 ).
dt t=t0
This expression vanishes under the no sliding condition. In general the
curve t 7→ ψt (γ(t0 )) will be non-constant, but (when the motion is without
sliding) its velocity will vanish at the instant t = t0 ; i.e. at the instant when
it becomes the point of contact. In other words the motion is without sliding
if and only if the point of contact is motionless.
We remark that, if the motion is without sliding, we have:
γ̇ ′ (t) = |Ψ(t)γ̇(t)| = |γ̇(t)|
so that the curves γ and γ ′ have the same arclength:
Z t1
Z t1
γ̇ ′ (t) dt =
|γ̇(t)| dt

on any interval [t0 , t1 ] ⊂ I. Hence any motion with γ̇ = 0 and γ̇ ′ ̸= 0 is not
without sliding (such as the example of pure sliding above).

150

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Exercise 3.5.8. Give an example of a motion where |γ̇(t)| = |γ̇ ′ (t)| for
every t but which is not without sliding.
Example 3.5.9. We describe mathematically the motion of the train wheel.
Let the center of the wheel move right parallel to the x-axis at height one
and the wheel have radius one and make one revolution in 2π units of time.
Then the track M ′ is the x-axis and we take

M := (x, y) ∈ R2 | x2 + (y − 1)2 = 1 .
Choose
γ(t) := (cos(t − π/2), 1 + sin(t − π/2))
= (sin(t), 1 − cos(t)),
′

γ (t) := (t, 0),
and define Ψ(t) ∈ GL(2) by

Ψ(t) :=

cos(t) sin(t)
− sin(t) cos(t)


.

The reader can easily verify that this is a motion without sliding. A fixed
point p0 on M , say p0 = (0, 0), sweeps out a cycloid with parametric equations
x = t − sin(t),
y = 1 − cos(t).
(Check that (ẋ, ẏ) = (0, 0) when y = 0; i.e. for t = 2nπ.)
Remark 3.5.10. These same formulas give a motion of a sphere M rolling
without sliding along a straight line in a plane M ′ . Namely in coordinates
(x, y, z) the sphere is given by the equation
x2 + (y − 1)2 + z 2 = 1,
the plane is y = 0 and the line is the x-axis. The z-coordinate of a point is
unaffected by the motion. Note that the curve γ ′ traces out a straight line
in the plane M ′ and the curve γ traces out a great circle on the sphere M .
Exercise 3.5.11. The operations of reparametrization, inversion, and composition respect motion without sliding; i.e. if (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) and (Ψ′ , γ ′ , γ ′′ )
are motions without sliding on an interval I and σ : J → I is a smooth
map between intervals, then the motions (Ψ ◦ σ, γ ◦ σ, γ ′ ◦ σ), (Ψ−1 , γ ′ , γ),
and (Ψ′ Ψ, γ, γ ′′ ) are also without sliding.

3.5. MOTIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS

3.5.3

151

Twisting and Wobbling

A motion (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) on an intervall I ⊂ R transforms vector fields along γ
into vector fields along γ ′ by the formula
X ′ (t) = (ΨX)(t) := Ψ(t)X(t) ∈ Tγ ′ (t) M ′
for t ∈ I and X ∈ Vect(γ); so X ′ ∈ Vect(γ ′ ).
Lemma 3.5.12. Let (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) be a motion of M along M ′ on an interval
I ⊂ R. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) The instantaneous velocity of each tangent vector is normal, i.e. for t ∈ I
⊥

Ψ̇(t)Tγ(t) M ⊂ Tγ ′ (t) M ′ .
(ii) Ψ intertwines covariant differentiation, i.e. for X ∈ Vect(γ)
∇′ (ΨX) = Ψ∇X.
(iii) Ψ transforms parallel vector fields along γ into parallel vector fields
along γ ′ , i.e. for X ∈ Vect(γ)
∇X = 0

=⇒

∇′ (ΨX) = 0.

(iv) Ψ intertwines parallel transport, i.e. for s, t ∈ I and v ∈ Tγ(s) M
Ψ(t)Φγ (t, s)v = Φ′γ ′ (t, s)Ψ(s)v.
A motion that satisfies these conditions is called without twisting.
Proof. We prove that (i) is equivalent to (ii). A motion satisfies the equation
Ψ(t)Π(γ(t)) = Π′ (γ ′ (t))Ψ(t)
for every t ∈ I. This restates the condition that Ψ(t) maps tangent vectors
of M to tangent vectors of M ′ and normal vectors of M to normal vectors
of M ′ . Differentiating the equation X ′ (t) = Ψ(t)X(t) we obtain
Ẋ ′ (t) = Ψ(t)Ẋ(t) + Ψ̇(t)X(t).
Applying Π′ (γ ′ (t)) this gives
∇′ X ′ = Ψ∇X + Π′ (γ ′ )Ψ̇X.
Hence (ii) holds if and only if Π′ (γ ′ (t))Ψ̇(t) = 0 for every t ∈ I. Thus we
have proved that (i) is equivalent to (ii). That (ii) implies (iii) is obvious.

152

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

We prove that (iii) implies (iv). Let t0 ∈ I and v0 ∈ Tγ(t0 ) M . Define the
vector field X ∈ Vect(γ) by X(t) := Φγ (t, t0 )v0 for t ∈ I and let X ′ := ΨX.
Then ∇X = 0, hence ∇′ X ′ = 0 by (iii), and hence
X ′ (t) = Φ′γ ′ (t, t0 )X ′ (t0 ) = Φ′γ ′ (t, t0 )Ψ(t0 )v0
for all t ∈ I. Since X ′ (t) = Ψ(t)X(t) = Ψ(t)Φγ (t, t0 )v0 , this implies (iv).
We prove that (iv) implies (ii). Let X ∈ Vect(γ) and X ′ := ΨX. By (iv)
we have
Φ′γ ′ (t0 , t)X ′ (t) = Ψ(t0 )Φγ (t0 , t)X(t).
Differentiating this equation with respect to t at t = t0 and using Theorem 3.3.6, we obtain ∇′ X ′ (t0 ) = Ψ(t0 )∇X(t0 ). This proves the lemma.
Lemma 3.5.13. Let (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) be a motion of M along M ′ on an interval
I ⊂ R. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) The instantaneous velocity of each normal vector is tangent, i.e. for t ∈ I
Ψ̇(t)Tγ(t) M ⊥ ⊂ Tγ ′ (t) M ′ .
(ii) Ψ intertwines normal covariant differentiation, i.e. for Y ∈ Vect⊥ (γ)
⊥

∇′ (ΨY ) = Ψ∇⊥ Y.
(iii) Ψ transforms parallel normal vector fields along γ into parallel normal
vector fields along γ ′ , i.e. for Y ∈ Vect⊥ (γ)
∇⊥ Y = 0

⊥

∇′ (ΨY ) = 0.

=⇒

(iv) Ψ intertwines parallel transport of normal vector fields, i.e. for s, t ∈ I
and w ∈ Tγ(s) M ⊥
⊥

′
Ψ(t)Φ⊥
γ (t, s)w = Φ γ ′ (t, s)Ψ(s)w.

A motion that satisfies these conditions is called without wobbling.
The proof that the four conditions in Lemma 3.5.13 are equivalent is
word for word analogous to the proof of Lemma 3.5.12 and will be omitted.
In summary a motion is without twisting iff tangent vectors at the point
of contact are rotating towards the normal space and it is without wobbling
iff normal vectors at the point of contact are rotating towards the tangent
space. In case m = 2 and n = 3 motion without twisting means that the
instantaneous axis of rotation is parallel to the tangent plane.

3.5. MOTIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS

Remark 3.5.14. The operations of reparametrization, inversion, and composition respect motion without twisting, respectively without wobbling; i.e.
if (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) and (Ψ′ , γ ′ , γ ′′ ) are motions without twisting, respectively without wobbling, on an interval I and σ : J → I is a smooth map between
intervals, then the motions (Ψ ◦ σ, γ ◦ σ, γ ′ ◦ σ), (Ψ−1 , γ ′ , γ), and (Ψ′ Ψ, γ, γ ′′ )
are also without twisting, respectively without wobbling.
Remark 3.5.15. Let I ⊂ R be an interval and t0 ∈ I. Given curves
γ : I → M and γ ′ : I → M ′ and an orthogonal matrix Ψ0 ∈ O(n) such that
Ψ0 Tγ(t0 ) M = Tγ ′ (t0 ) M ′
there is a unique motion (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) of M along M ′ (with the given γ and γ ′ )
without twisting or wobbling satisfying the initial condition:
Ψ(t0 ) = Ψ0 .
Indeed, the path of matrices Ψ : I → O(n) is uniquely determined by the
conditions (iv) in Lemma 3.5.12 and Lemma 3.5.13. It is given by the explicit
formula
Ψ(t)v = Φ′γ ′ (t, t0 )Ψ0 Φγ (t0 , t)Π(γ(t))v

for t ∈ I and v ∈ Rn . We prove below a somewhat harder result where the
motion is without twisting, wobbling, or sliding. It is in this situation that γ
and γ ′ determine one another (up to an initial condition).
Remark 3.5.16. We can now give another interpretation of parallel transport. Given γ : R → M and v0 ∈ Tγ(t0 ) M take M ′ to be an affine subspace of
the same dimension as M . Let (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) be a motion of M along M ′ without
twisting (and, if you like, without sliding or wobbling). Let X ′ ∈ Vect(γ ′ )
be the constant vector field along γ ′ (so that ∇′ X ′ = 0) with value
X ′ (t) = Ψ0 v0 ,

Ψ0 := Ψ(t0 ).

Let X ∈ Vect(γ) be the corresponding vector field along γ so that
Ψ(t)X(t) = Ψ0 v0
Then X(t) = Φγ (t, t0 )v0 . To put it another way, imagine that M is a ball. To
define parallel transport along a given curve γ roll the ball (without sliding)
along a plane M ′ keeping the curve γ in contact with the plane M ′ . Let γ ′
be the curve traced out in M ′ . If a constant vector field in the plane M ′ is
drawn in wet ink along the curve γ ′ , it will mark off a (covariant) parallel
vector field along γ in M .
Exercise 3.5.17. Describe parallel transport along a great circle in a sphere.

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Development

A development is an intrinsic version of motion without sliding or twisting.
Definition 3.5.18. A development of M along M ′ (on an interval I)
is a triple (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) where γ : I → M and γ ′ : I → M ′ are smooth paths
and Φ is a family of orthogonal isomorphisms
Φ(t) : Tγ(t) M → Tγ ′ (t) M ′
parametrized by t ∈ I, such that
Φ(t)γ̇(t) = γ̇ ′ (t)

(3.5.3)

for all t ∈ I and Φ intertwines parallel transport, i.e.
Φ(t)Φγ (t, s) = Φ′γ ′ (t, s)Φ(s)

(3.5.4)

for all s, t ∈ I. In particular, the family Φ of isomorphisms is smooth, i.e.
if X is a smooth vector field along γ, then the formula X ′ (t) := Φ(t)X(t)
defines a smooth vector field along γ ′ .
Lemma 3.5.19. Let I ⊂ R be an interval, γ : I → M and γ ′ : I → M ′
be smooth curves, and Φ(t) : Tγ(t) M → Tγ ′ (t) M ′ be a family of orthogonal
isomorphisms parametrized by t ∈ I. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) is a development.
(ii) Φ satisfies (3.5.3) and
∇′ (ΦX) = Φ∇X

(3.5.5)

for all X ∈ Vect(γ).
(iii) There exists a motion (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) without sliding and twisting such that
Φ(t) = Ψ(t)|Tγ(t) M

for all t ∈ I.

(3.5.6)

(iv) There exists a motion (Ψ, γ, γ ′ ) of M along M ′ without sliding, twisting,
and wobbling that satisfies (3.5.6).
Proof. That (3.5.4) is equivalent to (3.5.5) was proved in Lemma 3.5.12.
This (i) is equivalent to (ii). That (iv) implies (iii) and (iii) implies (i) is
obvious. To prove that (i) implies (iv) choose any t0 ∈ I and any orthogonal
matrix Ψ0 ∈ O(n) such that Ψ0 |Tγ(t0 ) M = Φ(t0 ) and define Ψ(t) : Rn → Rn
by (3.5.2). This proves Lemma 3.5.19.

3.5. MOTIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS

Remark 3.5.20. The operations of reparametrization, inversion, and composition yield developments when applied to developments; i.e. if (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) is
a development of M along M ′ on an interval I, (Φ′ , γ ′ , γ ′′ ) is a development
of M ′ along M ′′ on the same interval I, and σ : J → I is a smooth map of
intervals, then the triples
(Φ ◦ σ, γ ◦ σ, γ ′ ◦ σ),

(Φ−1 , γ ′ , γ)),

(Φ′ Φ, γ, γ ′′ )

are all developments.
Theorem 3.5.21 (Development Theorem). Let p0 ∈ M and t0 ∈ R,
let γ ′ : R → M ′ be a smooth curve, and let
Φ0 : Tp0 M → Tγ ′ (t0 ) M ′
be an orthogonal isomorphism. Then the following holds.
(i) There exists a development (Φ, γ, γ ′ |I ) on some open interval I ⊂ R
containing t0 that satisfies the initial condition
γ(t0 ) = p0 ,

Φ(t0 ) = Φ0 .

(3.5.7)

(ii) Any two developments (Φ1 , γ1 , γ ′ |I1 ) and (Φ2 , γ2 , γ ′ |I2 ) as in (i) on two
intervals I1 and I2 agree on the intersection I1 ∩ I2 , i.e.
γ1 (t) = γ2 (t),

Φ1 (t) = Φ2 (t)

for every t ∈ I1 ∩ I2 .
(iii) If M is complete, then (i) holds with I = R.
Proof. Let γ : R → M be any smooth curve such that
γ(t0 ) = p0
and, for t ∈ R, define the linear map
Φ(t) : Tγ(t) M → Tγ ′ (t) M ′
by
Φ(t) := Φ′γ ′ (t, t0 )Φ0 Φγ (t0 , t).

(3.5.8)

This is an orthogonal transformation for every t and it intertwines parallel
transport. However, in general Φ(t)γ̇(t) will not be equal to γ̇ ′ (t).

156

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

To construct a development that satisfies (3.5.3), we choose an orthonormal frame e0 : Rm → Tp0 M and, for t ∈ R, define e(t) : Rm → Tγ(t) M by
e(t) := Φγ (t, t0 )e0 .

(3.5.9)

We can think of e(t) as a real n × m-matrix and the map
R → Rn×m : t 7→ e(t)
is smooth. In fact, the map t 7→ (γ(t), e(t)) is a smooth path in the frame
bundle F(M ). Define the smooth map ξ : R → Rm by
γ̇ ′ (t) = Φ′γ ′ (t, t0 )Φ0 e0 ξ(t).

(3.5.10)

We prove the following.
Claim: The triple (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) is a development on an interval I ⊂ R if and
only if the path t 7→ (γ(t), e(t)) satisfies the differential equation
(γ̇(t), ė(t)) = Bξ(t) (γ(t), e(t))

(3.5.11)

for every t ∈ I, where Bξ(t) ∈ Vect(F(M )) denotes the basic vector field
associated to ξ(t) ∈ Rm (see equation (3.4.9)).
The triple (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) is a development on I if and only if
Φ(t)γ̇(t) = γ̇ ′ (t)
for every t ∈ I. By (3.5.8) and (3.5.10) this is equivalent to the condition
Φ′γ ′ (t, t0 )Φ0 Φγ (t0 , t)γ̇(t) = γ̇ ′ (t) = Φ′γ ′ (t, t0 )Φ0 e0 ξ(t),
hence to
Φγ (t0 , t)γ̇(t) = e0 ξ(t),
and hence to
γ̇(t) = Φγ (t, t0 )e0 ξ(t) = e(t)ξ(t)

(3.5.12)

for every t ∈ I. By (3.5.9) and the Gauß–Weingarten formula, we have
ė(t) = hγ(t) (γ̇(t))e(t)
for every t ∈ R. Hence it follows from (3.4.9) that (3.5.12) is equivalent
to (3.5.11). This proves the claim.
Parts (i) and (ii) follow directly from the claim. Part (iii) follows from
the claim and Definition 3.4.12. This proves Theorem 3.5.21.

3.5. MOTIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS

157

Remark 3.5.22. As any two developments (Φ1 , γ1 , γ ′ |I1 ) and (Φ2 , γ2 , γ ′ |I2 )
on two intervals I1 and I2 that satisfy the initial condition (3.5.7) agree
on I1 ∩ I2 there is a development defined on I1 ∪ I2 . Hence there is a
unique maximally defined development (Φ, γ, γ ′ |I ), defined on a maximal
interval I = I(t0 , p0 , Φ0 ), associated to the initial data t0 , p0 , Φ0 .
Denote the space of initial data by


t ∈ R, p ∈ M, Φ : Tp M → Tγ ′ (t) M ′
P := (t, p, Φ)
,
(3.5.13)
is an orthogonal transformation
define the set D ⊂ R × P by
D := {(t, t0 , p0 , Φ0 ) | (t0 , p0 , Φ0 ) ∈ P, t ∈ I(t0 , p0 , Φ0 )}

(3.5.14)

and let
D → P : (t, t0 , p0 , Φ0 ) 7→ (t, γ(t), Φ(t)),

(3.5.15)

be the map which assigns to each (t0 , p0 , Φ0 ) ∈ P and each t ∈ I(t0 , p0 , Φ0 )
the value at time t of the unique development (Φ, γ, γ ′ |I ) associated to the
inital condition (t0 , p0 , Φ0 ) on the maximal time interval I = I(t0 , p0 , Φ0 ).
Then the space P has a natural structure of a smooth manifold (in the
intrinsic setting), and it follows from Theorem 2.4.9 and the proof of Theorem 3.5.21 that D is an open subset of R × P and the map (3.5.15) is
smooth.
The smooth structure on P can be understood as follows. The space

O(γ ′ ) = (t, e′ ) | (γ ′ (t), e′ ) ∈ O(M ′ )
is the pullback of the orthonormal frame bundle O(M ′ ) → M ′ under the
curve γ ′ : R → M ′ or, equivalently, is the orthonormal frame bundle of the
pullback tangent bundle (γ ′ )∗ T M . Thus O(γ ′ ) is a smooth submanifold
of R × Rn×m . The group O(m) acts diagonally on O(γ ′ ) × O(M ) and the
action is free. Hence the quotient (O(γ ′ ) × O(M ))/O(m) is a smooth manifold by Theorem 2.9.14, and it can be naturally identified with P via the
bijection [(t, e′ ), (p, e)] 7→ (t, p, e′ ◦ e−1 ).
Remark 3.5.23. The statement of Theorem 3.5.21 is essentially symmetric
in M and M ′ as the operation of inversion carries developments to developments. Hence given
γ : R → M,

p′0 ∈ M ′ ,

t0 ∈ R,

Φ0 : Tγ(t0 ) M → Tp′0 M ′ ,

we may speak of the development (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) corresponding to γ with initial
conditions γ ′ (t0 ) = p′0 and Φ(t0 ) = Φ0 .

158

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Corollary 3.5.24 (Motions). Let p0 ∈ M and t0 ∈ R, let γ ′ : R → M ′ be
a smooth curve, and let Ψ0 ∈ O(n) be a matrix such that
Ψ0 Tp0 M = Tγ ′ (t0 ) M ′ .
Then the following holds.
(i) There exists a motion (Ψ, γ, γ ′ |I ) without sliding, twisting and wobbling
on some open interval I ⊂ R containing t0 that satisfies the initial condition γ(t0 ) = p0 and Ψ(t0 ) = Ψ0 .
(ii) Any two motions as in (i) on two intervals I1 and I2 agree on the
intersection I1 ∩ I2 .
(iii) If M is complete, then (i) holds with I = R.
Proof. Theorem 3.5.21 and Remark 3.5.15.
Corollary 3.5.25 (Completeness). The following are equivalent.
(i) M is complete, i.e. for every smooth curve ξ : R → Rm and every
element (p0 , e0 ) ∈ F(M ), there exists a smooth curve β : R → F(M ) such
that β̇(t) = Bξ(t) (β(t)) for all t ∈ R and β(0) = (p0 , e0 ) (Definition 3.4.12).
(ii) For every smooth curve ξ : R → Rm and every element (p0 , e0 ) ∈ O(M ),
there is a smooth curve α : R → O(M ) such that α̇(t) = Bξ(t) (α(t)) for every t ∈ R and α(0) = (p0 , e0 ).
(iii) For every smooth curve γ ′ : R → Rm , every p0 ∈ M , and every orthogonal isomorphism Φ0 : Tp0 M → Rm there exists a development (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) of M
along M ′ = Rm on all of R that satisfies γ(0) = p0 and Φ(0) = Φ0 .
Proof. We have already noted that the basic vector fields are all tangent to
the orthonormal frame bundle O(M ) ⊂ F(M ). Now note that if a smooth
curve I → F(M ) : t 7→ β(t) = (γ(t), e(t)) on an interval I ⊂ R satisfies the
differential equation
β̇(t) = Bξ(t) (β(t))
for all t, then so does the curve
I → F(M ) : t 7→ a∗ β(t) = (γ(t), e(t) ◦ a)
for every a ∈ GL(m, R). Since any frame e0 : Rm → Tp0 M can be carried to any other (in particular an orthonormal one) by a suitable matrix a ∈ GL(m, R), this shows that (i) is equivalent to (ii).
That (i) implies (iii) was proved in Theorem 3.5.21.

3.5. MOTIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS

159

We prove that (iii) implies (ii). Fix a smooth map ξ : R → Rm and an
element (p0 , e0 ) ∈ O(M ). Define

Φ0 := e−1

and

for t ∈ R.

0

By (ii) there exists a development (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) of M along Rm on all of R that
satisfies the initial conditions
γ(0) = p0 ,

Φ(0) = Φ0 .

Then
Φ(t) = Φ0 Φγ (0, t) : Tγ(t) M → Rm ,

Φ(t)γ̇(t) = γ̇ ′ (t) = ξ(t)

for all t ∈ R by Definition 3.5.18. Define
e(t) := Φγ (t, 0)e0 = Φ(t)−1 : Rm → Tγ(t) M
for t ∈ R. Then (γ, e) : R → F(M ) is a smooth curve that satisfies the initial
condition (γ(0), e(0)) = (p0 , e0 ) and the differential equation
γ̇(t) = Φ(t)−1 ξ(t) = e(t)ξ(t),
ė(t) = hγ(t) (γ̇(t))e(t) = hγ(t) (e(t)ξ(t))e(t)
by the Gauß–Weingarten formula. Thus
(γ̇(t), ė(t)) = Bξ(t) (γ(t), e(t))
for all t ∈ R. This proves Corollary 3.5.25.
It is of course easy to give an example of a manifold which is not complete; e.g. if (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) is any development of M along M ′ , then M \ {γ(t1 )}
is not complete as the given development is only defined for t ̸= t1 . In §4.6
we give equivalent characterizations of completeness. In particular, we will
see that any compact submanifold of Rn is complete.
Exercise 3.5.26. An affine subspace of Rn is a subset of the form

E =p+E= p+v v ∈E
where E ⊂ Rn is a linear subspace and p ∈ Rn . Prove that every affine
subspace of Rn is a complete submanifold.

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Christoffel Symbols

The goal of this subsection is to examine the covariant derivative in local
coordinates on an embedded manifold M ⊂ Rn of dimension m. Let
ϕ:U →Ω
be a coordinate chart, defined on an M -open subset U ⊂ M with values in
an open set Ω ⊂ Rm , and denote its inverse by
ψ := ϕ−1 : Ω → U ⊂ M.
At this point it is convenient to use superscripts for the coordinates of a
vector x ∈ Ω. Thus we write
x = (x1 , . . . , xm ) ∈ Ω.
If p = ψ(x) ∈ U is the corresponding element of M , then the tangent space
of M at p is the image of the linear map dψ(x) : Rm → Rn (Theorem 2.2.3)
and thus two tangent vectors v, w ∈ Tp M can be written in the form
v = dψ(x)ξ =
w = dψ(x)η =

for ξ = (ξ 1 , . . . , ξ m ) ∈ Rm and η = (η 1 , . . . , η m ) ∈ Rm . Recall that the restriction of the inner product in the ambient space Rn to the tangent space
is the first fundamental form gp : Tp M × Tp M → R (Definition 3.1.1). Thus

Now let c = (c1 , . . . , cm ) : I → Ω be a smooth curve in Ω, defined on an
interval I ⊂ R, and consider the curve
γ =ψ◦c:I →M
(see Figure 3.7). Our goal is to describe the operator X 7→ ∇X on the space
of vector fields along γ in local coordinates. Let X : I → Rn be a vector
field along γ. Then

X(t) ∈ Tγ(t) M = Tψ(c(t)) M = im dψ(c(t)) : Rm → Rn
for every t ∈ I and hence there exists a unique smooth function

We examine the projection ∇X(t) = Π(γ(t))Ẋ(t) of this vector onto the tangent space of M at γ(t). The first summand on the right in (3.6.5) is already

162

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

tangent to M . For the second summand we simply observe that the vector Π(ψ(x))∂ 2 ψ/∂xi ∂xj lies in tangent space Tψ(x) M and can therefore be
expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors ∂ψ/∂x1 , . . . , ∂ψ/∂xm .
The coefficients will be denoted by Γkij (x). Thus there exist smooth functions Γkij : Ω → R for i, j, k = 1, . . . , m such that

the Christoffel symbols associated to the coordinate chart ϕ : U → Ω. To
sum up we have proved the following.
Lemma 3.6.1. Let c : I → Ω be a smooth curve and define
γ := ψ ◦ c : I → M.
If ξ : I → Rm is a smooth map and X ∈ Vect(γ) is given by (3.6.4), then
its covariant derivative at time t ∈ I is given by

where the Γkij are the Christoffel symbols defined by (3.6.6).
Our next goal is to understand how the Christoffel symbols are determined by the metric in local coordinates. Recall from equation (3.6.2) that
the inner products on the tangent spaces inherited from the standard Euclidean inner product on the ambient space Rn are in local coordinates
represented by the matrix valued function
m×m
g = (gij )m
i,j=1 : Ω → R

.

(3.6.8)

Rn

We shall see that the Christoffel symbols are completely determined by the
functions gij : Ω → R. Here are first some elementary observations.

3.6. CHRISTOFFEL SYMBOLS

163

Remark 3.6.2. The matrix g(x) ∈ Rm×m is symmetric and positive definite
for every x ∈ Ω. This follows from the fact that the matrix dψ(x) ∈ Rn×m
has rank m and the matrix g(x) is given by
g(x) = dψ(x)T dψ(x)
Thus ξ T g(x)ξ = |dψ(x)ξ|2 > 0 for all ξ ∈ Rm \ {0}.
Remark 3.6.3. For x ∈ Ω we have det(g(x)) > 0 by Remark 3.6.2 and
so the matrix g(x) is invertible. Denote the entries of the inverse matrix g(x)−1 ∈ Rm×m by g kℓ (x). They are determined by the condition

m

1, if i = k,
jk

gij (x)g (x) = δi =
0, if i ̸= k.
j=1

Since g(x) is symmetric and positive definite, so is its inverse matrix g(x)−1 .
In particular, we have g kℓ (x) = g ℓk (x) for all x ∈ Ω and all k, ℓ ∈ {1, . . . , m}.
Remark 3.6.4. Suppose that X, Y ∈ Vect(γ) are vector fields along our
curve γ = ψ ◦ c : I → M and ξ, η : I → Rm are defined by
X(t) =

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Proof. Suppose that the Γkij are given by (3.6.6) and the gij by (3.6.8). Let
ξ, η : I → Rm

be smooth functions and suppose that the vector fields X, Y along the curve

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Riemannian Metrics*

We wish to carry over the fundamental notions of differential geometry to
the intrinsic setting. First we need an inner product on the tangent spaces
to replace the first fundamental form in Definition 3.1.1. This is the content
of Definition 3.7.1 and Lemma 3.7.4 below. Second we must introduce the
covariant derivative of a vector field along a curve. With this understood all
the definitions, theorems, and proofs in this chapter carry over in an almost
word by word fashion to the intrinsic setting.

3.7.1

Existence of Riemannian Metrics

We will always consider norms that are induced by inner products. But in
general there is no ambient space that can induce an inner product on each
tangent space. This leads to the following definition.
Definition 3.7.1. Let M be a smooth m-manifold. A Riemannian metric
on M is a collection of inner products
Tp M × Tp M → R : (v, w) 7→ gp (v, w),
one for every p ∈ M , such that the map
M → R : p 7→ gp (X(p), Y (p))
is smooth for every pair of vector fields X, Y ∈ Vect(M ). We will also
denote the inner product by ⟨v, w⟩p and drop the subscript p if the base
point is understood from the context. A smooth manifold equipped with a
Riemannian metric is called a Riemannian manifold.
Example 3.7.2. If M ⊂ Rn is a smooth submanifold, then a Riemannian
metric on M is given by restricting the standard inner product on Rn to
the tangent spaces Tp M ⊂ Rn . This is the first fundamental form of an
embedded manifold (see Definition 3.1.1).
More generally, assume that M is a Riemannian m-manifold in the intrinsic sense of Definition 3.7.1 with an atlas A = {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A . Then the
Riemannian metric g determines a collection of smooth functions

gα = (gα,ij )m

for x ∈ ϕα (Uα ) and ξ, η ∈ Rm .

dϕα (p)v = ξ,

dϕα (p)w = η, (3.7.2)

Each matrix gα (x) is symmetrix and positive definite. Note that the
tangent vectors v and w in (3.7.2) can also be written in the form
v = [α, ξ]p ,

w = [α, η]p .

Choosing standard basis vectors
ξ = ei ,

η = ej

in Rm we obtain
[α, ei ]p = dϕα (p)−1 ei =:

For different coordinate charts the maps gα and gβ are related through the
transition map
ϕβα := ϕβ ◦ ϕ−1
α : ϕα (Uα ∩ Uβ ) → ϕβ (Uα ∩ Uβ )
via
gα (x) = dϕβα (x)T gβ (ϕβα (x))dϕβα (x)

(3.7.4)

for x ∈ ϕα (Uα ∩ Uβ ). Equation (3.7.4) can also be written in the shorthand
notation
gα = ϕ∗βα gβ
for α, β ∈ A.
Exercise 3.7.3. Every collection of smooth maps
gα : ϕα (Uα ) → Rm×m
with values in the set of positive definite symmetric matrices that satisfies (3.7.4) for all α, β ∈ A determines a global Riemannian metric via (3.7.2).
In this intrinsic setting there is no canonical metric on M (such as the
metric induced by Rn on an embedded manifold). In fact, it is not completely
obvious that a manifold admits a Riemannian metric and this is the content
of the next lemma.

168

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Lemma 3.7.4. Every paracompact Hausdorff manifold admits a Riemannian metric.
Proof. Let m be the dimension of M and let A = {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A be an atlas
on M . By Theorem 2.9.9 there is a partition of unity {θα }α∈A subordinate
to the open cover {Uα }α∈A . Now there are two equivalent ways to construct
a Riemannian metric on M .
The first method is to carry over the standard inner product on Rm to
the tangent spaces Tp M for p ∈ Uα via the coordinate chart ϕα , multiply
the resulting Riemannian metric on Uα by the compactly supported function
θα , extend it by zero to all of M , and then take the sum over all α. This
leads to the following formula. The inner product of two tangent vectors
v, w ∈ Tp M is defined by
⟨v, w⟩p :=

X

θα (p)⟨dϕα (p)v, dϕα (p)w⟩,

(3.7.5)

p∈Uα

where the sum runs over all α ∈ A with p ∈ Uα and the inner product is
the standard inner product on Rm . Since supp(θα ) ⊂ Uα for each α and the
sum is locally finite we find that the function
M → R : p 7→ ⟨X(p), Y (p)⟩p
is smooth for every pair of vector fields X, Y ∈ Vect(M ). Moreover, the right
hand side of (3.7.5) is symmetric in v and w and is positive for v = w ̸= 0
because each summand is nonnegative and each summand with θα (p) > 0 is
positive. Thus equation (3.7.5) defines a Riemannian metric on M .
The second method is to define the functions
gα : ϕα (Uα ) → Rm×m
by
gα (x) :=

X

T
θγ (ϕ−1
α (x))dϕγα (x) dϕγα (x)

(3.7.6)

γ∈A

for x ∈ ϕα (Uα ) where each summand is defined on ϕα (Uα ∩ Uγ ) and is
understood to be zero for x ∈
/ ϕα (Uα ∩ Uγ ). We leave it to the reader to
verify that these functions are smooth and satisfy the condition (3.7.4) for
all α, β ∈ A. Moreover, the formulas (3.7.5) and (3.7.6) determine the same
Riemannian metric on M . (Prove this!) This proves Lemma 3.7.4.

Two Examples

Example 3.7.5 (Fubini–Study metric). The complex projective space
carries a natural Riemannian metric, defined as follows. Identify CPn with
the quotient of the unit sphere S 2n+1 ⊂ Cn+1 by the diagonal action of
the circle S 1 , i.e. CPn = S 2n+1 /S 1 . Then the tangent space of CPn at the
equivalence class
[z] = [z0 : · · · : zn ] ∈ CPn
of a point z = (z0 , . . . , zn ) ∈ S 2n+1 can be identified with the orthogonal
complement of Cz in Cn+1 . Now choose the inner product on T[z] CPn to
be the one inherited from the standard inner product on Cn+1 via this
identification. The resulting metric on CPn is called the Fubini–Study
metric. Exercise: Prove that the action of U(n + 1) on Cn+1 induces a
transitive action of the quotient group
PSU(n + 1) := U(n + 1)/S 1
by isometries. If z ∈ S 2n+1 , prove that the unitary matrix
g := 2zz ∗ − 1l
descends to an isometry ϕ on CPn with fixed point p := [z] and dϕ(p) = −id.
Show that, in the case n = 1, the pullback of the Fubini–Study metric on CP1

in Cn as a quotient of the space

Fk (Cn ) := D ∈ Cn×k | D∗ D = 1l
of unitary k-frames in Cn by the right action of the unitary group U(k).

the unitary group U(n) acts on Gk (Cn ) by isometries.

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

The Levi-Civita Connection

A subtle point in this discussion is how to extend the notion of covariant
derivative to general Riemannian manifolds. In this case the idea of projecting the derivative in the ambient space orthogonally onto the tangent space
has no obvious analogue. Instead we shall see how the covariant derivatives
of vector fields along curves can be characterized by several axioms and
these can be used to define the covariant derivative in the intrinsic setting.
An alternative, but somewhat less satisfactory, approach is to carry over
the formula for the covariant derivative in local coordinates to the intrinsic
setting and show that the result is independent of the choice of the coordinate chart. Of course, these approaches are equivalent and lead to the
same result. We formulate them as a series of exercises. The details are
straightforward.
Assume throughout that M is a Riemannian m-manifold with an atlas
A = {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A
and suppose that the Riemannian metric is in local coordinates given by
m×m
gα = (gα,ij )m
i,j=1 : ϕα (Uα ) → R

for α ∈ A. These functions satisfy (3.7.4) for all α, β ∈ A.
Definition 3.7.7. Let f : N → M be a smooth map between manifolds. A
vector field along f is a collection of tangent vectors
X(q) ∈ Tf (q) M,
one for each q ∈ N , such that the map
N → T M : q 7→ (f (q), X(q))
is smooth. The space of vector fields along f will be denoted by Vect(f ).
As before we will not distinguish in notation between the collection of
tangent vectors X(q) ∈ Tf (q) M and the associated map N → T M and
denote them both by X. The following theorem introduces the Levi-Civita
connection as a collection of linear operators ∇ : Vect(γ) → Vect(γ), one for
each smooth curve γ : I → M .

3.7. RIEMANNIAN METRICS*

171

Theorem 3.7.8 (Levi-Civita connection). There exists a unique collection of linear operators
∇ : Vect(γ) → Vect(γ)
(called the covariant derivative), one for every smooth curve γ : I → M
on an open interval I ⊂ R, satisfying the following axioms.
(Leibniz Rule) For every smooth curve γ : I → M , every smooth function
λ : I → R, and every vector field X ∈ Vect(γ), we have
∇(λX) = λ̇X + λ∇X.

(3.7.7)

(Chain Rule) Let Ω ⊂ Rn be an open set, let c : I → Ω be a smooth curve,
let γ : Ω → M be a smooth map, and let X be a smooth vector field along γ.
Denote by ∇i X the covariant derivative of X along the curve xi 7→ γ(x) (with
the other coordinates fixed). Then ∇i X is a smooth vector field along γ and
the covariant derivative of the vector field X ◦ c ∈ Vect(γ ◦ c) is
∇(X ◦ c) =

(Riemannian) For any two vector fields X, Y ∈ Vect(γ) we have
d
⟨X, Y ⟩ = ⟨∇X, Y ⟩ + ⟨X, ∇Y ⟩.
dt

(3.7.9)

(Torsion-free) Let I, J ⊂ R be open intervals and γ : I × J → M be
a smooth map. Denote by ∇s the covariant derivative along the curve
s 7→ γ(s, t) (with t fixed) and by ∇t the covariant derivative along the curve
t 7→ γ(s, t) (with s fixed). Then
∇s ∂t γ = ∇t ∂s γ.

(3.7.10)

Proof. The proof is based on a reformulation of the axioms in local coordinates. The (Leibnitz Rule) and (Chain Rule) axioms assert that the
covariant derivative is in local coordinates given by Christoffel symbols Γkij
as in equation (3.6.7) in Lemma 3.6.1. The (Riemannian) and (Torsion-free)
axioms assert that the Christoffel symbols satisfy the equations in (3.6.9)
and hence, by Lemma 3.6.5, are given by (3.6.10). (See also Exercise 3.7.10.)
This proves Theorem 3.7.8.

Basic Vector Fields in the Intrinsic Setting

Let M be a Riemannian m-manifold with an atlas A = {(ϕα , Uα )}α∈A .
Then the frame bundle (3.4.1) admits the structure of a smooth manifold
eα := π −1 (Uα ) and coordinate charts
with the open cover U
eα → ϕα (Uα ) × GL(m)
ϕeα : U
given by
ϕeα (p, e) := (ϕα (p), dϕα (p)e) .
The derivatives of the horizontal curves in Definition 3.4.6 form a horizontal subbundle H ⊂ T F(M ) of the tangent bundle of the Frame bundle
whose fibers H(p,e) over an element (p, e) ∈ F(M ) can in local coordinates
be described as follows. Let
a := dϕα (p)e ∈ GL(m),

(3.7.13)

and let (b
x, b
a) ∈ Rm × Rm×m . This pair has the form
(b

for k, ℓ = 1, . . . , m, where the functions Γkα,ij : ϕα (Uα ) → R are the Christoffel symbols defined by (3.7.11). Thus a tangent vector (b
p, eb) ∈ T(p,e) F(M )
is horizontal if and only if its coordinates (b
x, b
a) in (3.7.14) satisfy (3.7.15).
Hence, for every vector ξ ∈ Rm , there exists a unique horizontal vector
field Bξ ∈ Vect(F(M )) (the basic vector field associated to ξ) such that
dπ(p, e)Bξ (p, e) = eξ
for all (p, e) ∈ F(M ). This vector field assigns to a pair (p, e) ∈ F(M ) with
the coordinates (x, a) ∈ Rm × GL(m) as in (3.7.13) the horizontal tangent

p, eb) ∈ H(p,e) ⊂ T(p,e) F(M ) whose coordinates (b

CHAPTER 3. THE LEVI-CIVITA CONNECTION

Chapter 4

Geodesics
This chapter introduces geodesics in Riemannian manifolds. It begins in §4.1
by introducing geodesics as extremals of the energy and length functionals
and characterizing them as solutions of a second order differential equation.
In §4.2 we show that minimizing the length with fixed endpoints gives rise
to an intrinsic distance function d : M × M → R which induces the topology M inherits from the ambient space Rn . §4.3 introduces the exponential
map, §4.4 shows that geodesics minimize the length on short time intervals,
§4.5 establishes the existence of geodesically convex neighborhoods, and §4.6
shows that the geodesic flow is complete if and only if (M, d) is a complete
metric space, and that in the complete case any two points are joined by a
minimal geodesic. §4.7 discusses geodesics in the intrinsic setting.

4.1

Length and Energy

This section explains the length and energy functionals on the space of paths
with fixed endpoints and introduces geodesics as their extremal points.

4.1.1

The Length and Energy Functionals

The concept of a geodesic in a manifold generalizes that of a straight line in
Euclidean space. A straight line has parametrizations of form t 7→ p + σ(t)v
where σ : R → R is a diffeomorphism and p, v ∈ Rn . Different choices of σ
yield different parametrizations of the same line. Certain parametrizations
are preferred, for example those parametrizations which are “proportional
to the arclength”, i.e. where σ(t) = at + b for constants a, b ∈ R, so that
the tangent vector σ̇(t)v has constant length. The same distinctions can
175

176

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

be made for geodesics. Some authors use the term geodesic to include all
parametrizations of a geodesic while others restrict the term to cover only
geodesics parametrized proportional to the arclength. We follow the latter
course, referring to the more general concept as a “reparametrized geodesic”.
Thus a reparametrized geodesic need not be a geodesic.
We assume throughout that M ⊂ Rn is a smooth m-manifold.
Definition 4.1.1 (Length and energy). Let I = [a, b] ⊂ R be a compact interval with a < b and let γ : I → M be a smooth curve in M . The
length L(γ) and the energy E(γ) are defined by
Z b
|γ̇(t)| dt,

L(γ) :=

|γ̇(t)|2 dt.
(4.1.2)
2 a
A variation of γ is a family of smooth curves γs : I → M , where s
ranges over the reals, such that the map R × I → M : (s, t) 7→ γs (t) is
smooth and γ0 = γ. The variation {γs }s∈R is said to have fixed endpoints
iff γs (a) = γ(a) and γs (b) = γ(b) for all s ∈ R.
E(γ) :=

Remark 4.1.2. The length of a continuousPfunction γ : [a, b] → Rn can
be defined as the supremum of the numbers N
i=1 |γ(ti ) − γ(ti−1 )| over all
partitions a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tN = b of the interval [a, b]. By a theorem in
first year analysis [64] this supremum is finite whenever γ is continuously
differentiable and is given by (4.1.1).
We shall sometimes suppress the notation for the endpoints a, b ∈ I.
When γ(a) = p and γ(b) = q we say that γ is a curve from p to q. One
can always compose γ with an affine reparametrization t′ = a + (b − a)t to
obtain a new curve γ ′ (t) := γ(t′ ) on the unit interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. This new
curve satisfies L(γ ′ ) = L(γ) and E(γ ′ ) = (b − a)E(γ). More generally, the
length L(γ), but not the energy E(γ), is invariant under reparametrization.
Remark 4.1.3 (Reparametrization). Let I = [a, b] and I ′ = [a′ , b′ ] be
compact intervals. If γ : I → Rn is a smooth curve and σ : I ′ → I is a
smooth function such that σ(a′ ) = a, σ(b′ ) = b, and σ̇(t′ ) ≥ 0 for all t′ ∈ I ′ ,
then the curves γ and γ ◦ σ have the same length. Namely,

Theorem 4.1.4 (Characterization of geodesics). Let I = [a, b] ⊂ R be
a compact interval and let γ : I → M be a smooth curve. Then the following
are equivalent.
(i) γ is an extremal of the energy functional, i.e. every variation {γs }s∈R
of γ with fixed endpoints satisfies
d
ds s=0 E(γs ) = 0.

(ii) γ is parametrized proportional to the arclength, i.e. the velocity |γ̇(t)| ≡ c ≥ 0 is constant, and either γ is constant, i.e. γ(t) = p = q for
all t ∈ I, or c > 0 and γ is an extremal of the length functional, i.e.
every variation {γs }s∈R of γ with fixed endpoints satisfies
d
ds s=0 L(γs ) = 0.

(iii) The velocity vector of γ is parallel, i.e. ∇γ̇(t) = 0 for all t ∈ I.
(iv) The acceleration of γ is normal to M , i.e. γ̈(t) ⊥ Tγ(t) M for all t ∈ I.
(v) If (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) is a development of M along M ′ = Rm , then γ ′ : I → Rm is
a straight line parametrized proportional to the arclength, i.e. γ̈ ′ ≡ 0.
Proof. See §4.1.3.
Definition 4.1.5 (Geodesic). A smooth curve γ : I → M on an interval I
is called a geodesic iff its restriction to each compact subinterval satisfies
the equivalent conditions of Theorem 4.1.4. So γ is a geodesic if and only if
∇γ̇(t) = 0

for all t ∈ I.

(4.1.4)

By the Gauß–Weingarten formula (3.2.2) with X = γ̇ this is equivalent to
γ̈(t) = hγ(t) (γ̇(t), γ̇(t))

for all t ∈ I.

(4.1.5)

Remark 4.1.6. (i) The conditions (i) and (ii) in Theorem 4.1.4 are meaningless when I is not compact because then the curve has at most one
endpoint and the length and energy integrals may be infinite. However, the
conditions (iii), (iv), and (v) in Theorem 4.1.4 are equivalent for smooth
curves on any interval, compact or not.
(ii) The function s 7→ E(γs ) associated to a smooth variation is always
smooth and so condition (i) in Theorem 4.1.4 is meaningful. However, more
care has to be taken in part (ii) because the function s 7→ L(γs ) need not be
differentiable. It is differentiable at s = 0 whenever γ̇(t) ̸= 0 for all t ∈ I.

178

4.1.2

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

The Space of Paths

Fix two points p, q ∈ M and a compact interval I = [a, b] and denote by

Ωp,q := Ωp,q (I) := γ : I → M γ is smooth and γ(a) = p, γ(b) = q
the space of smooth curves in M from p to q, defined on the interval I. Then
the length and energy are functionals L, E : Ωp,q → R and their extremal
points can be understood as critical points as we now explain.
We may think of the space Ωp,q as a kind of “infinite-dimensional manifold”. This is to be understood in a heuristic sense and we use these terms
here to emphasize an analogy. Of course, the space Ωp,q is not a manifold
in the strict sense of the word. To begin with it is not embedded in any
finite-dimensional Euclidean space. However, it has many features in common with manifolds. The first is that we can speak of smooth curves in Ωp,q .
Of course Ωp,q is itself a space of curves in M . Thus a smooth curve in Ωp,q
would then be a curve of curves, namly a map R → Ωp,q : s 7→ γs that assigns to each real number s a smooth curve γs : I → M satisfying γs (a) = p
and γs (b) = q. We shall call such a curve of curves smooth iff the associated
map R × I → M : (s, t) 7→ γs (t) is smooth. Thus smooth curves in Ωp,q are
the variations of γ with fixed endpoints introduced in Definition 4.1.1.
Having defined what we mean by a smooth curve in Ωp,q we can also
differentiate such a curve with respect to s. Here we can simply recall that,
since M ⊂ Rn , we have a smooth map R × I → Rn and the derivative of
the curve s 7→ γs in Ωp,q can simply be understood as the partial derivative
of the map (s, t) 7→ γs (t) with respect to s. Thus, in analogy with embedded manifolds, we define the tangent space of the space of curves Ωp,q
at γ as the set of all derivatives of smooth curves R → Ωp,q : s 7→ γs passing
through γ, i.e.


∂
Tγ Ωp,q :=
γs R → Ωp,q : s 7→ γs is smooth and γ0 = γ .
∂s s=0
∂
Let us denote such a partial derivative by X(t) := ∂s
γ (t) ∈ Tγ(t) M .
s=0 s
Thus we obtain a smooth vector field along γ. Since γs (a) = p and γs (b) = q
for all s, this vector field must vanish at t = a, b. This suggests the formula

Tγ Ωp,q = {X ∈ Vect(γ) | X(a) = 0, X(b) = 0} .

(4.1.6)

That every tangent vector of the path space Ωp,q at γ is a vector field along γ
vanishing at the endpoints follows from the above discussion. The converse
inclusion is the content of the next lemma.

4.1. LENGTH AND ENERGY

Lemma 4.1.7. Let p, q ∈ M , γ ∈ Ωp,q , and X ∈ Vect(γ) with X(a) = 0
and X(b) = 0. Then there exists a smooth map R → Ωp,q : s 7→ γs such that
γ0 (t) = γ(t),

∂
γs (t) = X(t)

(4.1.7)

Proof. The proof has two steps.
Step 1. There exists smooth map M × I → Rn : (r, t) 7→ Yt (r) with compact
support such that Yt (r) ∈ Tr M for all t ∈ I and r ∈ M and Ya (r) = Yb (r) = 0
for all r ∈ M .
n
Define Zt (r) := Π(r)X(t) for t ∈ I and r ∈ M . Choose an open
S set U ⊂ R
such that γ(I) ⊂ U and U ∩ M is compact (e.g. take U := a≤t≤b Bε (γ(t))
for ε > 0 sufficiently small). Now let β : Rn → [0, 1] be a smooth cutoff
function with support in the unit ball such that β(0) = 1 and define the
vector fields Yt by Yt (r) := β(ε−1 (r − γ(t)))Zt (r) for t ∈ I and r ∈ M .

Step 2. We prove the lemma.
The vector field Yt : M → T M in Step 1 is complete for each t. Thus
there exists a unique smooth map R × I → M : (s, t) 7→ γs (t) such that,
for each t ∈ I, the curve R → M : s 7→ γs (t) is the unique solution of the
∂
differential equation ∂s
γs (t) = Yt (γs (t)) with γ0 (t) = γ(t). These maps γs
satisfies (4.1.7) by Step 1.
We can now define the derivative of the energy functional E at γ
in the direction of a tangent vector X ∈ Tγ Ωp,q by
dE(γ)X :=

d
E(γs ),
ds s=0

(4.1.8)

where s 7→ γs is as in Lemma 4.1.7. Similarly, the derivative of the length
functional L at γ in the direction of X ∈ Tγ Ωp,q is defined by
dL(γ)X :=

d
L(γs ).
ds s=0

(4.1.9)

To define (4.1.8) and (4.1.9) the functions s 7→ E(γs ) and s 7→ L(γs ) must
be differentiable at s = 0. This is true for E but it only holds for L
when γ̇(t) ̸= 0 for all t ∈ I. Second, we must show that the right hand sides
of (4.1.8) and (4.1.9) depend only on X and not on the choice of {γs }s∈R .
Third, we must verify that dE(γ) : Tγ Ωp,q → R and dL(γ) : Ωp,q → R are linear maps. This is an exercise in first year analysis (see also the proof of Theorem 4.1.4). A curve γ ∈ Ωp,q is then an extremal point of E (respectively L
when γ̇(t) ̸= 0 for all t) if and only if dE(γ) = 0 (respectively dL(γ) = 0).
Such a curve is also called a critical point of E (respectively L).

Characterization of Geodesics

Proof of Theorem 4.1.4. The equivalence of (iii) and (iv) follows directly
from the equations ∇γ̇(t) = Π(γ(t))γ̈(t) and ker(Π(γ(t))) = Tγ(t) M ⊥ .
We prove that (i) is equivalent to (iii) and (iv). Let X ∈ Tγ Ωp,q and
choose a smooth curve of curves R → Ωp,q : s 7→ γs satisfying (4.1.7). Then
the function (s, t) 7→ |γ̇s (t)|2 is smooth and hence

That (iii) implies (i) follows directly from this identity. To prove that (i) implies (iv) we argue indirectly and assume that there exists a point t0 ∈ [0, 1]
such that γ̈(t0 ) is not orthogonal to Tγ(t0 ) M . Then there exists a vector v0 ∈ Tγ(t0 ) M such that ⟨γ̈(t0 ), v0 ⟩ > 0. We may assume without loss
of generality that a < t0 < b. Then there exists a constant ε > 0 such
that a < t0 − ε < t0 + ε < b and
t0 − ε < t < t 0 + ε

=⇒

⟨γ̈(t), Π(γ(t))v0 ⟩ > 0.

Now choose a smooth cutoff function β : I → [0, 1] such that β(t) = 0 for
all t ∈ I with |t − t0 | ≥ ε and β(t0 ) = 1. Define X ∈ Tγ Ωp,q by
X(t) := β(t)Π(γ(t))v0

for t ∈ I.

Then ⟨γ̈(t), X(t)⟩ ≥ 0 for all t and ⟨γ̈(t0 ), X(t0 )⟩ > 0. Hence
Z b
dE(γ)X = −
⟨γ̈(t), X(t)⟩ dt < 0

and so γ does not satisfy (i). Thus (i) is equivalent to (iii) and (iv).

4.1. LENGTH AND ENERGY

181

We prove that (i) is equivalent to (ii). Assume first that γ satisfies (i).
Then γ also satisfies (iv) and hence γ̈(t) ⊥ Tγ(t) M for all t ∈ I. This implies
0 = ⟨γ̈(t), γ̇(t)⟩ =

1d
|γ̇(t)|2 .
2 dt

Hence the function I → R : t 7→ |γ̇(t)|2 is constant. Choose c ≥ 0 such
that |γ̇(t)| ≡ c. If c = 0, then γ(t) is constant and so γ(t) ≡ p = q. If c > 0,
then

Thus, in the case c > 0, γ is an extremal point of E if and only if it is an
extremal point of L. Hence (i) is equivalent to (ii).
We prove that (iii) is equivalent to (v). Let (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) be a development
of M along M ′ = Rm . Then
γ̇ ′ (t) = Φ(t)γ̇(t),

d
Φ(t)X(t) = Φ(t)∇X(t)

for all X ∈ Vect(γ) and all t ∈ I. Take X = γ̇ to obtain γ̈ ′ (t) = Φ(t)∇γ̇(t) for
all t ∈ I. Thus ∇γ̇ ≡ 0 if and only if γ̈ ′ ≡ 0. This proves Theorem 4.1.4.
Remark 4.1.3 shows that reparametrization by a nondecreasing surjective
map σ : I ′ → I gives rise to map
Ωp,q (I) → Ωp,q (I ′ ) : γ 7→ γ ◦ σ
which preserves the length functional, i.e.
L(γ ◦ σ) = L(γ)
for all γ ∈ Ωp,q (I). Thus the chain rule in infinite dimensions should assert
that if γ◦σ is an extremal (i.e. critical) point of L, then γ is an extremal point

of L. Moreover, if σ is a diffeomorphism, the map γ 7→ γ ◦ σ is bijective and
should give rise to a bijective correspondence between the extremal points
of L on Ωp,q (I) and those on Ωp,q (I ′ ). Finally, if the tangent vector field γ̇
vanishes nowhere, then γ can be parametrized by the arclength. This is
spelled out in more detail in the next exercise.

(iii) Prove that γ is an extremal point of L if and only if the curve γ ′ in
part (i) is a geodesic.
(iv) Prove that γ is an extremal point of L if and only if there exists a
geodesic γ ′ : I ′ → M and a diffeomorphism σ : I ′ → I such that γ ′ = γ ◦ σ.
Next we generalize this exercise to cover the case where γ̇ is allowed to
vanish. Recall from Remark 4.1.6 that the function s 7→ L(γs ) need not be
differentiable. As an example consider the case where γ = γ0 is constant
(see also Exercise 4.4.12 below).
Exercise 4.1.9. Let γ : I → M be a smooth curve and let X ∈ Tγ Ωp,q (I).
Choose a smooth curve of curves R → Ωp,q (I) : s 7→ γs that satisfies (4.1.7).

Distance

Assume that M ⊂ Rn is a connected smooth m-dimensional submanifold.
Two points p, q ∈ M are of distance |p − q| apart in the ambient Euclidean
space Rn . In this section we define a distance function which is more intimately tied to M by minimizing the length functional over the space of
curves in M with fixed endpoints. Thus it may happen that two points
in M have a very short distance in Rn but can only be joined by very long
curves in M (see Figure 4.1). This leads to the intrinsic distance in M .
Throughout we denote by I = [0, 1] the unit interval and, for p, q ∈ M , by
Ωp,q := {γ : [0, 1] → M | γ is smooth and γ(0) = p, γ(1) = q}

(4.2.1)

the space of smooth paths on the unit interval joining p to q. Since M is
connected the set Ωp,q is nonempty for all p, q ∈ M . (Prove this!)

Definition 4.2.1. The intrinsic distance between two points p, q ∈ M is
the real number d(p, q) ≥ 0 defined by
d(p, q) := inf L(γ).
γ∈Ωp,q

(4.2.2)

The inequality d(p, q) ≥ 0 holds because each curve has nonnegative length
and the inequality d(p, q) < ∞ holds because Ωp,q ̸= ∅.
Remark 4.2.2. Every smooth curve γ : [0, 1] → Rn with endpoints γ(0) = p
and γ(1) = q satisfies the inequality
Z 1

γ̇(t) dt = |p − q| .

Thus d(p, q) ≥ |p − q|. For γ(t) := p + t(q − p) we have equality and hence
the straight lines minimize the length among all curves from p to q.

184

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

Lemma 4.2.3. The function d : M × M → [0, ∞) defines a metric on M :
(i) If p, q ∈ M satisfy d(p, q) = 0, then p = q.
(ii) For all p, q ∈ M we have d(p, q) = d(q, p).
(iii) For all p, q, r ∈ M we have d(p, r) ≤ d(p, q) + d(q, r).
Proof. By Remark 4.2.2 we have d(p, q) ≥ |p − q| for all p, q ∈ M and this
proves part (i). Part (ii) follows from the fact that the curve γ
e(t) := γ(1 − t)
has the same length as γ and belongs to Ωq,p whenever γ ∈ Ωp,q . To prove
part (iii) fix a constant ε > 0 and choose curves γ0 ∈ Ωp,q and γ1 ∈ Ωq,r
such that L(γ0 ) < d(p, q) + ε and L(γ1 ) < d(q, r) + ε. By Remark 4.1.3 we
may assume without loss of generality that γ0 (1 − t) = γ1 (t) = q for t > 0
sufficiently small. Under this assumption the curve

γ0 (2t),
for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2,
γ(t) :=
γ1 (2t − 1), for 1/2 < t ≤ 1
is smooth. Moreover, γ(0) = p and γ(1) = r and so γ ∈ Ωp,r . Thus
d(p, r) ≤ L(γ) = L(γ0 ) + L(γ1 ) < d(p, q) + d(q, r) + 2ε.
Hence d(p, r) < d(p, q) + d(q, r) + 2ε for every ε > 0. This proves part (iii)
and Lemma 4.2.3.
Remark 4.2.4. It is natural to ask if the infimum in (4.2.2) is always
attained. This is easily seen not to be the case in general. For example,
let M result from the Euclidean space Rm by removing a point p0 . Then
the distance d(p, q) = |p − q| is equal to the length of the line segment from p
to q and any other curve from p to q is longer. Hence if p0 is in the interior
of this line segment, the infimum is not attained. We shall prove below that
the infimum is attained whenever M is complete.

Example 4.2.5. Let

M := S 2 = p ∈ R3 | |p| = 1
be the unit sphere in R3 and fix two points p, q ∈ S 2 . Then d(p, q) is the
length of the shortest curve on the 2-sphere connecting p and q. Such a
curve is a segment on a great circle through p and q (see Figure 4.2) and its
length is
d(p, q) = cos−1 (⟨p, q⟩),
(4.2.3)
where ⟨p, q⟩ denotes the standard inner product, and we have
0 ≤ d(p, q) ≤ π.
(See Example 4.3.11 below for details.) By Lemma 4.2.3 this defines a metric
on S 2 . Exercise: Prove directly that (4.2.3) is a distance function on S 2 .
We now have two topologies on our manifold M ⊂ Rn , namely the topology determined by the metric d in Lemma 4.2.3 and the relative topology
inherited from Rn . The latter is also determined by a distance function,
namely the extrinsic distance function defined as the restriction of the Euclidean distance function on Rn to the subset M . We denote it by
d0 : M × M → [0, ∞),

d0 (p, q) := |p − q| .

(4.2.4)

A natural question is if these two metrics d and d0 induce the same topology
on M . In other words is a subset U ⊂ M open with respect to d0 if and only
if it is open with respect to d? Or, equivalently, does a sequence pν ∈ M
converge to p0 ∈ M with respect to d if and only if it converges to p0 with
respect to d0 ? Lemma 4.2.7 answers this question in the affirmative.
Exercise 4.2.6. Prove that every translation of Rn and every orthogonal
transformation preserves the lengths of curves.
Lemma 4.2.7. For every p0 ∈ M we have
d(p, q)
= 1.

Lemma 4.2.8. Let p0 ∈ M and let ϕ0 : U0 → Ω0 be a coordinate chart onto
an open subset of Rm such that its derivative dϕ0 (p0 ) : Tp0 M → Rm is an
orthogonal transformation. Then
d(p, q)
= 1.
p,q→p0 |ϕ0 (p) − ϕ0 (q)|

186

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

The proofs will be given below. The lemmas imply that the topology M
inherits as a subset of Rm , the topology on M determined by the metric d,
and the topology on M induced by the local coordinate systems on M are
all the same.
Corollary 4.2.9. For every subset U ⊂ M the following are equivalent.
(i) U is open with respect to the metric d in (4.2.2).
(ii) U is open with respect to the metric d0 in (4.2.4).
(iii) For every coordinate chart ϕ0 : U0 → Ω0 of M onto an open subset Ω0 ⊂ Rm the set ϕ0 (U0 ∩ U ) is an open subset of Rm .
Proof. By Remark 4.2.2 we have
|p − q| ≤ d(p, q)

(4.2.5)

for all p, q ∈ M . Thus the identity idM : (M, d) → (M, d0 ) is Lipschitz
continuous with Lipschitz constant one and so every d0 -open subset of M
is d-open. Conversely, let U ⊂ M be a d-open subset of M and let p0 ∈ U
and ε > 0. Then, by Lemma 4.2.7, there exists a constant δ > 0 such that
all p, q ∈ M with |p − p0 | < δ and |q − p0 | < δ satisfy
d(p, q) ≤ (1 + ε)|p − q|.
Since U is d-open, there exists a constant ρ > 0 such that
Bρ (p0 , d) ⊂ U.
With



this implies Bρ0 (p0 , d0 ) ⊂ U . Namely, if p ∈ M satisfies
|p − p0 | < ρ0 ≤ δ,
then
d(p, p0 ) ≤ (1 + ε)|p − p0 | < (1 + ε)ρ0 ≤ ρ
and so p ∈ U . Thus U is d0 -open and this proves that (i) is equivalent to (ii).
That (ii) implies (iii) follows from the fact that each coordinate chart ϕ0
is a homeomorphism. To prove that (iii) implies (i), we argue indirectly
and assume that U is not d-open. Then there exists a sequence pν ∈ M \ U
that converges to an element p0 ∈ U . Let ϕ0 : U0 → Ω0 be a coordinate
chart with p0 ∈ U0 . Then limν→∞ |ϕ0 (pν ) − ϕ0 (p0 )| = 0 by Lemma 4.2.8.
Thus ϕ0 (U0 ∩ U ) is not open and so U does not satisfy (iii). This proves
Corollary 4.2.9.

Figure 4.3: Locally, M is the graph of f .
Proof of Lemma 4.2.7. By Remark 4.2.2 the estimate |p − q| ≤ d(p, q) holds
for all p, q ∈ M . The lemma asserts that, for all p0 ∈ M and all ε > 0, there
exists a d0 -open neighborhood U0 ⊂ M of p0 such that all p, q ∈ U0 satisfy
|p − q| ≤ d(p, q) ≤ (1 + ε)|p − q|.

(4.2.6)

Let p0 ∈ M and ε > 0, and define x : Rn → Tp0 M and y : Rn → Tp0 M ⊥ by
x(p) := Π(p0 )(p − p0 ),

y(p) := (1l − Π(p0 )) (p − p0 ),

where Π(p0 ) : Rn → Tp0 M denotes the orthogonal projection as usual.
Then the derivative of the map x|M : M → Tp0 M at p = p0 is the identity on Tp0 M . Hence the Inverse Function Theorem 2.2.17 asserts that
the map x|M : M → Tp0 M is locally invertible near p0 . Extending this
inverse to a smooth map from Tp0 M to Rn and composing it with the
map y : M → Tp0 M ⊥ , we obtain a smooth map
f : Tp0 M → Tp0 M ⊥
and an open neighborhood W ⊂ Rn of p0 such that
p∈M

⇐⇒

y(p) = f (x(p))

for all p ∈ W (see Figure 4.3). Moreover, by definition the map f satisfies
f (0) = 0 ∈ Tp0 M ⊥ ,

df (0) = 0 : Tp0 M → Tp0 M ⊥ .

Hence there exists a constant δ > 0 such that, for every x ∈ Tp0 M , we have
|x| < δ

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

Define
U0 := {p ∈ M ∩ W | |x(p)| < δ} .
Given p, q ∈ U0 let γ : [0, 1] → M be the curve whose projection to the x-axis
is the straight line joining x(p) to x(q), i.e.
x(γ(t)) = x(p) + t(x(q) − x(p)) =: x(t),
y(γ(t)) = f (x(γ(t))) = f (x(t)) =: y(t).
Then γ(t) ∈ U0 for all t ∈ [0, 1] and

= (1 + ε) |x(p) − x(q)|
= (1 + ε) |Π(p0 )(p − q)|
≤ (1 + ε) |p − q| .
Hence d(p, q) ≤ L(γ) ≤ (1 + ε) |p − q| and this proves Lemma 4.2.7.
Proof of Lemma 4.2.8. By assumption we have
|dϕ0 (p0 )v| = |v|
for all v ∈ Tp0 M . Fix a constant ε > 0. Then, by continuity of the derivative,
there exists a d0 -open neighborhood M0 ⊂ M of p0 such that for all p ∈ M0
and all v ∈ Tp M we have
(1 − ε) |dϕ0 (p)v| ≤ |v| ≤ (1 + ε) |dϕ0 (p)v| .
Thus for every curve γ : [0, 1] → M0 we have
(1 − ε)L(ϕ0 ◦ γ)) ≤ L(γ) ≤ (1 + ε)L(ϕ0 ◦ γ).
One is tempted to take the infimum over all curves γ : [0, 1] → M0 joining
two pints p, q ∈ M0 to obtain the inequality
(1 − ε) |ϕ0 (p) − ϕ0 (q)| ≤ d(p, q) ≤ (1 + ε) |ϕ0 (p) − ϕ0 (q)| .

(4.2.7)

However, we must justify these inequalities by showing that the infimum
over all curves in M0 agrees with the infimum over all curves in M joining
the points p and q.

4.2. DISTANCE

189

It suffices to show that the inequalities hold on a smaller heighborhood M1 ⊂ M0 of p0 . Choose such a smaller neighborhood M1 such that the
open set ϕ0 (M1 ) is a convex subset of Ω0 . Then the right inequality in (4.2.7)
follows by taking the curve γ : [0, 1] → M1 from γ(0) = p to γ(1) = q such
that ϕ0 ◦ γ : [0, 1] → ϕ0 (M1 ) is a straight line. To prove the left inequality
in (4.2.7) we use the fact that M0 is d-open by Lemma 4.2.7. Hence, after
shrinking M1 if necessary, there exists a constant r > 0 such that
p0 ∈ M1 ⊂ Br (p0 , d) ⊂ B3r (p0 , d) ⊂ M0 .
Then, for p, q ∈ M1 we have d(p, q) ≤ 2r while L(γ) ≥ 4r for any curve γ
from p to q which leaves M0 . Hence the distance d(p, q) of p, q ∈ M1 is the
infimum of the lengths L(γ) over all curves γ : [0, 1] → M0 that join γ(0) = p
to γ(1) = q. This proves the left inequality in (4.2.7) and Lemma 4.2.8.
A next question one might ask is the following. Can we choose a coordinate chart ϕ : U → Ω on M with values in an open set Ω ⊂ Rm so that
the length of each smooth curve γ : [0, 1] → U is equal to the length of the
curve c := ϕ ◦ γ : [0, 1] → Ω? We examine this question by considering the
inverse map ψ := ϕ−1 : Ω → U . Denote the components of x and ψ(x) by
x = (x1 , . . . , xm ) ∈ Ω,

ψ(x) = (ψ 1 (x), . . . , ψ n (x)) ∈ U.

Given a smooth curve [0, 1] → Ω : t 7→ c(t) = (c1 (t), . . . , cm (t)) we can write
the length of the composition γ = ψ ◦ c : [0, 1] → M in the form

This means that ψ preserves angles and areas. The next example shows that

Example 4.2.10. Consider the manifold M = S 2 . If there is a diffeomorphism ψ : Ω → U from an open set Ω ⊂ R2 onto an open set U ⊂ S 2 that
satisfies (4.2.10), it has to map straight lines onto arcs of great circles and
it preserves the area. However, the area A of a spherical triangle bounded
by three arcs on great circles satisfies the angle sum formula
α + β + γ = π + A.
(See Figure 4.4.) Hence there can be no such map ψ.

The Exponential Map

Geodesics give rise to a flow on the tangent bundle, the geodesic flow. It is
generated by a vector field on the tangent bundle, called the geodesic spray.
The time-1-map of the geodesic flow gives rise to the exponential map.

4.3.1

Geodesic Spray

The tangent bundle T M is a smooth 2m-dimensional manifold in Rn × Rn
by Corollary 2.6.12. The next lemma characterizes the tangent bundle of
the tangent bundle. Compare this with Lemma 3.4.5.
Lemma 4.3.1. The tangent space of T M at (p, v) ∈ T M is given by

.
(4.3.1)
T(p,v) T M = (b
p, vb) ∈ R × R
1l − Π(p) vb = hp (b
p, v)
Proof. We prove the inclusion “⊂” in (4.3.1). Let (b
p, vb) ∈ T(p,v) T M and
choose a smooth curve R → T M : t 7→ (γ(t), X(t)) such that
γ(0) = p,

X(0) = v,

γ̇(0) = pb,

Ẋ(0) = vb.

Then Ẋ = ∇X + hγ (γ̇, X) by the Gauß–Weingarten formula (3.2.2) and
hence (1l − Π(γ(t)))Ẋ(t) = hγ(t) (γ̇(t), X(t)) for all t ∈ R. Take t = 0 to
obtain (1l − Π(p))b
v = hp (b
p, v). This proves the inclusion “⊂” in (4.3.1).
Equality holds because both sides of the equation are 2m-dimensional linear
subspaces of Rn × Rn .
By Lemma 4.3.1 a smooth map S = (S1 , S2 ) : T M → Rn × Rn is a vector
field on T M if and only if
S1 (p, v) ∈ Tp M,

(1l − Π(p))S2 (p, v) = hp (S1 (p, v), v)

for all (p, v) ∈ T M . A special case is where S1 (p, v) = v. Such vector fields
correspond to second order differential equations on M .
Definition 4.3.2 (Spray). A vector field S ∈ Vect(T M ) is called a spray
iff it has the form S(p, v) = (v, S2 (p, v)) where S2 : T M → Rn is a smooth
map satisfying
(1l − Π(p))S2 (p, v) = hp (v, v),

S2 (p, λv) = λ2 S2 (p, v)

(4.3.2)

for all (p, v) ∈ T M and λ ∈ R. The vector field S ∈ Vect(T M ) defined by
S(p, v) := (v, hp (v, v))

T(p,v) T M

for p ∈ M and v ∈ Tp M is called the geodesic spray.

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

The Exponential Map

Lemma 4.3.3. Let γ : I → M be a smooth curve on an open interval I ⊂ R.
Then γ is a geodesic if and only if the curve I → T M : t 7→ (γ(t), γ̇(t)) is
an integral curve of the geodesic spray S in (4.3.3).
Proof. A smooth curve I → T M : t 7→ (γ(t), X(t)) is an integral curve of S
if and only if γ̇(t) = X(t) and Ẋ(t) = hγ(t) (X(t), X(t)) for all t ∈ I. By
equation (4.1.5), this holds if and only if γ is a geodesic and γ̇ = X.
Combining Lemma 4.3.3 with Theorem 2.4.7 we obtain the following
existence and uniqueness result for geodesics.
Lemma 4.3.4. Let M ⊂ Rn be an m-dimensional submanifold.
(i) For every p ∈ M and every v ∈ Tp M there is an ε > 0 and a smooth
curve γ : (−ε, ε) → M such that
∇γ̇ ≡ 0,

γ(0) = p,

γ̇(0) = v.

(4.3.4)

(iI) If γ1 : I1 → M and γ2 : I2 → M are geodesics and t0 ∈ I1 ∩ I2 with
γ1 (t0 ) = γ2 (t0 ),

γ̇1 (t0 ) = γ̇2 (t0 ),

then γ1 (t) = γ2 (t) for all t ∈ I1 ∩ I2 .
Proof. Lemma 4.3.3 and Theorem 2.4.7.
Definition 4.3.5 (Exponential map). For p ∈ M and v ∈ Tp M the interval

[
I is an open interval containing 0 and there is a
Ip,v :=

.
geodesic γ : I → M satisfying γ(0) = p, γ̇(0) = v
is called the maximal existence interval for the geodesic through p in the
direction v. For p ∈ M define the set Vp ⊂ Tp M by
Vp := {v ∈ Tp M | 1 ∈ Ip,v } .

(4.3.5)

The exponential map at p is the map expp : Vp → M that assigns to every
tangent vector v ∈ Vp the point expp (v) := γ(1), where γ : Ip,v → M is the
unique geodesic satisfying γ(0) = p and γ̇(0) = v.

Lemma 4.3.6. (i) The set
V := {(p, v) | p ∈ M, v ∈ Vp } ⊂ T M
is open and the map V → M : (p, v) 7→ expp (v) is smooth.
(ii) If p ∈ M and v ∈ Vp , then
Ip,v = {t ∈ R | tv ∈ Vp }
and the geodesic γ : Ip,v → M with γ(0) = p and γ̇(0) = v is given by
t ∈ Ip,v .

γ(t) = expp (tv),

Proof. Part (i) follows directly from Lemma 4.3.3 and Theorem 2.4.9. To
prove part (ii), fix an element p ∈ M and a tangent vector v ∈ Vp , and
let γ : Ip,v → M be the unique geodesic with γ(0) = p and γ̇(0) = v. Fix a
nonzero real number λ and define the map γλ : λ−1 Ip,v → M by
γλ (t) := γ(λt)

for t ∈ λ−1 Ip,v .

Then γ̇λ (t) = λγ̇(λt) ans γ̈λ (t) = λ2 γ̈(λt) and hence
∇γ̇λ (t) = Π(γλ (t))γ̈λ (t) = λ2 Π(γ(λt))γ̈(λt) = λ2 ∇γ̇(λt) = 0
for every t ∈ λ−1 Ip,v . This shows that γλ is a geodesic with
γλ (0) = p,

γ̇λ (0) = λv.

In particular, we have λ−1 Ip,v ⊂ Ip,λv . Interchanging the roles of v and λv
we obtain λ−1 Ip,v = Ip,λv . Thus
λ ∈ Ip,v

⇐⇒

1 ∈ Ip,λv

⇐⇒

and
γ(λ) = γλ (1) = expp (λv)
for λ ∈ Ip,v . This proves Lemma 4.3.6.

λv ∈ Vp

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

Since expp (0) = p by definition, the derivative of the exponential map
at v = 0 is a linear map from Tp M to itself. This derivative is the identity
map as illustrated in Figure 4.5 and proved in the following corollary.
Corollary 4.3.7. The map expp : Vp → M is smooth and its derivative at
the origin is d expp (0) = id : Tp M → Tp M .
Proof. The set Vp is an open subset of the linear subspace Tp M ⊂ Rn ,
with respect to the relative topology, and hence is a manifold. The tangent space of Vp at each point is Tp M . By Lemma 4.3.6 the exponential
map expp : Vp → M is smooth and its derivative at the origin is given by
d expp (0)v =

d
expp (tv) = γ̇(0) = v,
dt t=0

where γ : Ip,v → M is once again the unique geodesic through p in the
direction v. This proves Corollary 4.3.7.
Corollary 4.3.8. Let p ∈ M and, for r > 0, denote
Br (p) := {v ∈ Tp M | |v| < r} .
If r > 0 is sufficiently small, then Br (p) ⊂ Vp , the set
Ur (p) := expp (Br (p))
is an open subset of M , and the restriction of the exponential map to Br (p)
is a diffeomorphism from Br (p) to Ur (p).
Proof. This follows directly from Corollary 4.3.7 and Theorem 2.2.17.
Definition 4.3.9 (Injectivity radius). Let M ⊂ Rn be a smooth mmanifold. The injectivity radius of M at p is the supremum of all real
numbers r > 0 such that Br (p) ⊂ Vp and the restriction of the exponential
map expp to Br (p) is a diffeomorphism onto its image
Ur (p) := expp (Br (p)).
It will be denoted by

Examples and Exercises

Example 4.3.10. The exponential map on Rm is given by
expp (v) = p + v

for p, v ∈ Rm .

For every p ∈ Rm this map is a diffeomorphism from Tp Rm = Rm to Rm and
hence the injectivity radius of Rm is infinity.
Example 4.3.11. The exponential map on S m is given by
expp (v) = cos(|v|)p +

sin(|v|)
v
|v|

for every p ∈ S m and every nonzero tangent vector v ∈ Tp S m = p⊥ . The restriction of this map to the open ball of radius r in Tp M is a diffeomorphism
onto its image if and only if r ≤ π. Hence the injectivity radius of S m
at every point is π. Exercise: Given p ∈ S m and 0 ̸= v ∈ Tp S m = p⊥ ,
prove that the geodesic γ : R → S m with γ(0) = p and γ̇(0) = v is given
by γ(t) = cos(t |v|)p + sin(t|v|)
|v| v for t ∈ R. Show that in the case 0 ≤ |v| ≤ π
there is no shorter curve in S m connecting p and q := γ(1) and deduce that
the intrinsic distance on S m is given by d(p, q) = cos−1 (⟨p, q⟩) for p, q ∈ S m
(see Example 4.2.5 for m = 2).
Example 4.3.12. Consider the orthogonal group O(n) ⊂ Rn×n with the
standard inner product ⟨v, w⟩ := trace(v T w) on Rn×n . The orthogonal
projection Π(g) : Rn×n → Tg O(n) is given by

1
Π(g)v :=
v − gv T g
2
and the second fundamental form by
hg (v, v) = −gv T v.
Hence a curve γ : R → O(n) is a geodesic if and only if γ T γ̈ + γ̇ T γ̇ = 0 or,
equivalently, γ T γ̇ is constant. This shows that geodesics in O(n) have the
form γ(t) = g exp(tξ) for g ∈ O(n) and ξ ∈ o(n). It follows that
expg (v) = g exp(g −1 v) = exp(vg −1 )g
for g ∈ O(n) and v ∈ Tg O(n). In particular, for g = 1l the exponential
map exp1l : o(n) → O(n) agrees with the exponential matrix.
Exercise 4.3.13. What is the injectivity radius of the 2-torus T2 = S 1 × S 1 ,
the punctured 2-plane R2 \ {(0, 0)}, and the orthogonal group O(n)?

that is based on the existence and uniqueness of solutions of second order
differential equations in local coordinates.

Minimal Geodesics

Any straight line segment in Euclidean space is the shortest curve joining its
endpoints. The analogous assertion for geodesics in a manifold M is false;
consider for example an arc which is more than half of a great circle on a
sphere. In this section we consider curves which realize the shortest distance
between their endpoints.

4.4.1

Characterization of Minimal Geodesics

Lemma 4.4.1. Let I = [a, b] be a compact interval, let γ : I → M be a
smooth curve, and define p := γ(a) and q := γ(b). Then the following are
equivalent.
(i) γ is parametrized proportional to the arclength, i.e. |γ̇(t)| = c is constant,
and γ minimizes the length, i.e. L(γ) ≤ L(γ ′ ) for every smooth curve γ ′ in M
joining p and q.
(ii) γ minimizes the energy, i.e. E(γ) ≤ E(γ ′ ) for every smooth curve γ ′
in M joining p and q.
Definition 4.4.2 (Minimal geodesic). A smooth curve γ : I → M on a
compact interval I ⊂ R is called a minimal geodesic iff it satisfies the
equivalent conditions of Lemma 4.4.1.
Remark 4.4.3. (i) Condition (i) says that (the velocity |γ̇| is constant
and) L(γ) = d(p, q), i.e. that γ is a shortest curve from p to q. It is not
precluded that there be more than one such γ; consider for example the
case where M is a sphere and p and q are antipodal.
(ii) Condition (ii) implies that
d
E(γs ) = 0
ds s=0
for every smooth variation R × I → M : s 7→ γs (t) of γ with fixed endpoints.
Hence a minimal geodesic is a geodesic.
(iii) Finally, we remark that L(γ) (but not E(γ)) is independent of the
parametrization of γ. Hence, if γ is a minimal geodesic, then L(γ) ≤ L(γ ′ )
for every γ ′ (from p to q) whereas E(γ) ≤ E(γ ′ ) for those γ ′ defined on (an
interval the same length as) I.

198

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

Proof of Lemma 4.4.1. We prove that (i) implies (ii). Let c be the (constant)
value of |γ̇(t)|. Then
L(γ) = (b − a)c,

E(γ) =

(b − a)c2
.

Then, for every smooth curve γ ′ : I → M with γ ′ (a) = p and γ ′ (b) = q, we

= 4E(γ)E(γ ′ ).
Here the fourth step follows from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. Now
divide by 4E(γ) to obtain E(γ) ≤ E(γ ′ ).
We prove that (ii) implies (i). We have already shown in Remark 4.4.3
that (ii) implies that γ is a geodesic. It is easy to dispose of the case where
M is one-dimensional. In that case any γ minimizing E(γ) or L(γ) must be
monotonic onto a subarc; otherwise it could be altered so as to make the
integral smaller. Hence suppose M is of dimension at least two. Suppose,
by contradiction, that L(γ ′ ) < L(γ) for some curve γ ′ from p to q. Since
the dimension of M is bigger than one, we may approximate γ ′ by a curve
whose tangent vector nowhere vanishes, i.e. we may assume without loss of
generality that γ̇ ′ (t) ̸= 0 for all t. Then we can reparametrize γ ′ proportional
to arclength without changing its length, and by a further transformation
we can make its domain equal to I. Thus we may assume without loss of
generality that γ ′ : I → M is a smooth curve with γ ′ (a) = p and γ ′ (b) = q
such that |γ ′ (t)| = c′ and
(b − a)c′ = L(γ ′ ) < L(γ) = (b − a)c.
This implies c′ < c and hence
E(γ ′ ) =

(b − a)c′ 2
(b − a)c2

This contradicts (ii) and proves Lemma 4.4.1.

Local Existence of Minimal Geodesics

The next theorem asserts the existence of minimal geodesics joining two
points that are sufficiently close to each other. It also shows that the
set Ur (p) = expp (Br (p)) that was introduced in Definition 4.3.9 is actually
the open ball Ur (p) = {q ∈ M | d(p, q) < r} whenever r ≤ inj(p; M ).
Theorem 4.4.4 (Existence of minimal geodesics). Let M ⊂ Rn be a
smooth m-manifold, fix a point p ∈ M , and let r > 0 be smaller than the
injectivity radius of M at p. Let v ∈ Tp M such that |v| < r. Then
d(p, q) = |v| ,

q := expp (v),

and a curve γ ∈ Ωp,q has minimal length L(γ) = |v| if and only if there is a
smooth map β : [0, 1] → [0, 1] satisfying
β(0) = 0,

β(1) = 1,

β̇ ≥ 0

such that γ(t) = expp (β(t)v) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
The proof is based on the following lemma.

Proof of Theorem 4.4.4. Let r > 0 be as in Corollary 4.3.8 and let v ∈ Tp M
such that 0 < |v| =: ε < r. Denote q := expp (v) and let γ ∈ Ωp,q . Assume
first that

γ(t) ∈ expp B ε (p) = U ε
∀ t ∈ [0, 1].
Then there is a unique smooth function [0, 1] → Tp M : t 7→ v(t) such that
|v(t)| ≤ ε and γ(t) = expp (v(t)) for every t. The set
I := {t ∈ [0, 1] | γ(t) ̸= p} = {t ∈ [0, 1] | v(t) ̸= 0} ⊂ (0, 1]
is open in the relative topology of (0, 1]. Thus I is a union of open intervals
in (0, 1) and one half open interval containing 1. Define β : [0, 1] → [0, 1]
and w : I → Tp M by
|v(t)|
,
ε

β(t) :=

Then β is continuous, both β and w are smooth on I,

w(1) = v,

and
|w(t)| = ε,

γ(t) = expp (β(t)w(t))

for all t ∈ I. We prove that L(γ) ≥ ε. To see this let α : [0, 1] × I → M be
the map of Lemma 4.4.5, i.e.
α(s, t) := expp (sw(t)).
Then γ(t) = α(β(t), t) and hence

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

Here the last equality follows by applying the fundamental theorem of calculus to each interval in I and using the fact that β(0) = 0 and β(1) = 1.
If L(γ) = ε, we must have
∂α
(β(t), t) = 0,
∂t

β̇(t) ≥ 0

for all t ∈ I.

Thus I is a single half open interval containing 1 and on this interval the
condition ∂α
∂t (β(t), t) = 0 implies ẇ(t) = 0. Since w(1) = v we have w(t) = v
for every t ∈ I. Hence γ(t) = expp (β(t)v) for every t ∈ [0, 1]. It follows
that β is smooth on the closed interval [0, 1] (and not just on I). Thus we
have proved that every γ ∈ Ωp,q with values in U ε has length L(γ) ≥ ε with
equality if and only if γ is a reparametrized geodesic. But if γ ∈ Ωp,q does not
take values only in U ε , there must be a T ∈ (0, 1) such that γ([0, T ]) ⊂ U ε
and γ(T ) ∈ ∂Uε . Then L(γ|[0,T ] ) ≥ ε, by what we have just proved,
and L(γ|[T,1] ) > 0 because the restriction of γ to [T, 1] cannot be constant;
so in this case we have L(γ) > ε. This proves Theorem 4.4.4.
The next corollary gives a partial answer to our problem of finding length
minimizing curves. It asserts that geodesics minimize the length locally.
Corollary 4.4.6. Let M ⊂ Rn be a smooth m-manifold, let I ⊂ R be an
open interval, and let γ : I → M be a geodesic. Fix a point t0 ∈ I. Then
there exists a constant ε > 0 such that
t0 − ε < s < t < t0 + ε

=⇒

L(γ|[s,t] ) = d(γ(s), γ(t)).

Proof. Since γ is a geodesic its derivative has constant norm |γ̇(t)| ≡ c (see
Theorem 4.1.4). Choose δ > 0 so small that the interval [t0 − δ, t0 + δ] is
contained in I. Then there is a constant r > 0 such that r ≤ inj(γ(t))
whenever |t − t0 | ≤ δ. Choose ε > 0 such that
ε < δ,

2εc < r.

If t0 − ε < s < t < t0 + ε, then
γ(t) = expγ(s) ((t − s)γ̇(s))
and
|(t − s)γ̇(s)| = |t − s| c < 2εc < r ≤ inj(γ(s)).
Hence it follows from Theorem 4.4.4 that
L(γ|[s,t] ) = |t − s| c = d(γ(s), γ(t)).
This proves Corollary 4.4.6.

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

Exercise 4.4.11. Let γ : I = [a, b] → M be a smooth curve with endpoints γ(a) = p and γ(b) = q and nowhere vanishing derivative, i.e. γ̇(t) ̸= 0
for all t ∈ I. Prove that the following are equivalent.
(i) The curve γ is an extremal of the length functional, i.e. every
smooth map R × I → M : (s, t) 7→ γs (t) with γs (a) = p and γs (b) = q for
all s satisfies
d
L(γs )
= 0.
ds
s=0
(ii) The curve γ is a reparametrized geodesic, i.e. there exists a smooth
map σ : [a, b] → [0, 1] with σ(a) = 0, σ(b) = 1, σ̇(t) ≥ 0 for all t ∈ I, and a
vector v ∈ Tp M such that
q = expp (v),

γ(t) = expp (σ(t)v)

for all t ∈ I. (We remark that the hypothesis γ̇(t) ̸= 0 implies that σ is
actually a diffeomorphism, i.e. σ̇(t) > 0 for all t ∈ I.)
(iii) The curve γ minimizes the length functional locally, i.e. there exists an ε > 0 such that L(γ|[s,t] ) = d(γ(s), γ(t)) for every closed subinterval [s, t] ⊂ I of length t − s < ε.
It is often convenient to consider curves γ where γ̇(t) is allowed to vanish
for some values of t; then γ cannot (in general) be parametrized by arclength.
Such a curve γ : I → M can be smooth (as a map) and yet its image may
have corners (where γ̇ necessarily vanishes). Note that a curve with corners
can never minimize the distance, even locally.
Exercise 4.4.12. Show that conditions (ii) and (iii) in Exercise 4.4.11 are
equivalent, even without the assumption that γ̇ is nowhere vanishing. Deduce that, if γ : I → M is a shortest curve joining p to q, i.e. L(γ) = d(p, q),
then γ is a reparametrized geodesic.
Show by example that one can have a variation {γs }s∈R of a reparametrized geodesic γ0 = γ for which the map s 7→ L(γs ) is not even differentiable
at s = 0. (Hint: Take γ to be constant. See also Exercise 4.1.9.)
Show, however, that conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) in Exercise 4.4.11 remain
equivalent if the hypothesis that γ̇ is nowhere vanishing is weakened to the
hypothesis that γ̇(t) ̸= 0 for all but finitely many t ∈ I. Conclude that a broken geodesic is a reparametrized geodesic if and only if it minimizes arclength
locally. (A broken geodesic is a continuous map γ : I = [a, b] → M for
which there exist a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b such that γ|[ti−1 ,ti ] is a geodesic
for i = 1, . . . , n. It is thus a geodesic if and only if γ̇ is continuous at the
+
break points, i.e. γ̇(t−
i ) = γ̇(ti ) for i = 1, . . . , n − 1.)

Convex Neighborhoods

A subset of an affine space is called convex iff it contains the line segment
joining any two of its points. The definition carries over to a submanifold M
of Euclidean space (or indeed more generally to any manifold M equipped
with a spray) once we reword the definition so as to confront the difficulty
that a geodesic joining two points might not exist nor, if it does, need it be
unique.
Definition 4.5.1 (Geodesically convex set). Let M ⊂ Rn be a smooth
m-dimensional manifold. A subset U ⊂ M is called geodesically convex iff, for all p0 , p1 ∈ U , there exists a unique geodesic γ : [0, 1] → U such
that γ(0) = p0 and γ(1) = p1 .
It is not precluded in Definition 4.5.1 that there be other geodesics from p
to q which leave and then re-enter U , and these may even be shorter than
the geodesic in U .
Exercise 4.5.2. (a) Find a geodesically convex set U in a manifold M and
points p0 , p1 ∈ U such that the unique geodesic γ : [0, 1] → U with γ(0) = p0
and γ(1) = p1 has length L(γ) > d(p0 , p1 ). Hint: An interval of length
bigger than π in S 1 .
(b) Find a set U in a manifold M such that any two points in U can be
joined by a minimal geodesic in U , but U is not geodesically convex. Hint:
A closed hemisphere in S 2 .
Theorem 4.5.3 (Convex Neighborhood Theorem). Let M ⊂ Rn be a
smooth m-dimensional submanifold and fix a point p0 ∈ M . Let ϕ : U → Ω
be any coordinate chart on an open neighborhood U ⊂ M of p0 with values
in an open set Ω ⊂ Rm . Then the set
Ur := {p ∈ U | |ϕ(p) − ϕ(p0 )| < r}

(4.5.1)

is geodesically convex for r > 0 sufficiently small.
Before giving the proof of Theorem 4.5.3 we derive a useful corollary.
Corollary 4.5.4. Let M ⊂ Rn be a smooth m-manifold and let p0 ∈ M .
Then, for r > 0 sufficiently small, the open ball
Ur (p0 ) := {p ∈ M | d(p0 , p) < r}
is geodesically convex.

(4.5.2)

206

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

Proof. Choose an orthonormal basis e1 , . . . , em of Tp0 M and define
Ω := {x ∈ Rm | |x| < inj(p0 ; M )} ,
U := {p ∈ M | d(p0 , p) < inj(p0 ; M )} .

Define the map ψ : Ω → U by
m

ψ(x) := expp0

i=1

for x = (x1 , . . . , xm ) ∈ Ω. Then ψ is a diffeomorphism and d(p0 , ψ(x)) = |x|
for all x ∈ Ω by Theorem 4.4.4. Hence its inverse
ϕ := ψ −1 : U → Ω

(4.5.5)

satisfies ϕ(p0 ) = 0 and |ϕ(p)| = d(p0 , p) for all p ∈ U . Thus
Ur (p0 ) = {p ∈ U | |ϕ(p) − ϕ(p0 )| < r}

for 0 < r < inj(p0 ; M )

and so Corollary 4.5.4 follows from Theorem 4.5.3.
Definition 4.5.5 (Geodesically normal coordinates). The coordinate
chart ϕ : U → Ω in (4.5.4) and (4.5.5) sends geodesics through p0 to straight
lines through the origin. Its components x1 , . . . , xm : U → R are called geodesically normal coordinates at p0 .
Proof of Theorem 4.5.3. Assume without loss of generality that ϕ(p0 ) = 0.
Let Γkij : Ω → R be the Christoffel symbols of the coordinate chart and,
for x ∈ Ω, define the quadratic function Qx : Rm → R by
Qx (ξ) :=

Now let γ : [0, 1] → U be a geodesic and define
c(t) := ϕ(γ(t))
for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Then, by Lemma 4.3.14, c satisfies the differential equation

and so the function t 7→ |ϕ(γ(t))|2 is convex. Thus, if γ(0), γ(1) ∈ Ur for
some r > 0, it follows that γ(t) ∈ Ur for all t ∈ [0, 1].
Consider the exponential map
V = {(p, v) ∈ T M | v ∈ Vp } → M : (p, v) 7→ expp (v)
in Lemma 4.3.6. Its domain V is open and the exponential map is smooth.
Since it sends the pair (p0 , 0) ∈ V to expp0 (0) = p0 ∈ U , it follows from continuity that there exist constants ε > 0 and r > 0 such that
p ∈ Ur , v ∈ Tp M, |v| < ε

v ∈ Vp , expp (v) ∈ U.

=⇒

(4.5.6)

Moreover, we have
d expp0 (0) = id : Tp0 M → Tp0 M
by Corollary 4.3.7. Hence the Implicit Function Theorem 2.6.15 asserts that
the constants ε > 0 and r > 0 can be chosen such that (4.5.6) holds and there
exists a smooth map h : Ur × Ur → Rn that satisfies the conditions
h(p, q) ∈ Tp M,

|h(p, q)| < ε

(4.5.7)

for all p, q ∈ Ur and
expp (v) = q

⇐⇒

v = h(p, q)

for all p, q ∈ Ur and all v ∈ Tp M with |v| < ε. In particular, we have
h(p0 , p0 ) = 0
and expp (h(p, q)) = q for all p, q ∈ Ur .

(4.5.8)

208

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

Fix two constants ε > 0 and r > 0 and a smooth map h : Ur × Ur → Rn
such that (4.5.6), (4.5.7), (4.5.8) are satisfied. We show that any two
points p, q ∈ Ur are joined by a geodesic in Ur . Let p, q ∈ Ur and define
γ(t) := expp (th(p, q))

for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

This curve γ : [0, 1] → M is well defined by (4.5.6) and (4.5.7), it is a
geodesic satisfying γ(0) = p ∈ Ur by Lemma 4.3.6, it satisfies γ(1) = q ∈ Ur
by (4.5.8), it takes values in U by (4.5.6) and (4.5.7), and so γ([0, 1]) ⊂ Ur
because the function [0, 1] → R : t 7→ |ϕ(γ(t))|2 is convex.
We show that there exists at most one geodesic in Ur joining p and q.
Let p, q ∈ Ur and let γ : [0, 1] → Ur be any geodesic such that γ(0) = p
and γ(1) = q. Define v := γ̇(0) ∈ Tp M . Then γ(t) = expp (tv) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1
by Lemma 4.3.6. We claim that |v| < ε. Suppose, by contradiction, that
|v| ≥ ε.
Then

ε
≤1
|v|
and, for 0 < t < T , we have |tv| < ε and expp (tv) = γ(t) ∈ Ur and so
T :=

h(p, γ(t)) = tv.
by (4.5.8). Thus
|h(p, γ(t))| = t|v|

for 0 < t < T.

Take the limit t ↗ T to obtain
|h(p, γ(T ))| = T |v| = ε
in contradiction to (4.5.7). This contradiction shows that |v| < ε. Since
expp (v) = γ(1) = q ∈ Ur
it follows from (4.5.8) that v = h(p, q). This proves Theorem 4.5.3.
Remark 4.5.6. Theorem 4.5.3 and its proof carry over to general sprays
(see Definition 4.3.2).
Exercise 4.5.7. Consider the set Ur (p) = {q ∈ M | d(p, q) < r} for p ∈ M
and r > 0. Corollary 4.5.4 asserts that this set is geodesically convex for r
sufficiently small. How large can you choose r in the cases
M = S2,

M = T2 = S 1 × S 1 ,

M = R2 ,

M = R2 \ {0}.

Compare this with the injectivity radius. If the set Ur (p) in these examples is geodesically convex, does it follow that every geodesic in Ur (p) is
minimizing?

Completeness and Hopf–Rinow

For a Riemannian manifold there are different notions of completeness.
First, in §3.4 completeness was defined in terms of the completeness of time
dependent basic vector fields on the frame bundle (Definition 3.4.10). Second, there is a distance function
d : M × M → [0, ∞)
defined by equation (4.2.2) so that we can speak of completeness of the
metric space (M, d) in the sense that every Cauchy sequence converges.
Third, there is the question of whether geodesics through any point in any
direction exist for all time; if so we call a Riemannian manifold geodesically
complete. The remarkable fact is that these three rather different notions of
completeness are actually equivalent and that, in the complete case, any two
points in M can be joined by a shortest geodesic. This is the content of the
Hopf–Rinow theorem. We will spell out the details of the proof for embedded
manifolds and leave it to the reader (as a straight forward exercise) to extend
the proof to the intrinsic setting.

Geodesic Completeness
Definition 4.6.1 (Geodesically complete manifold). Let M ⊂ Rn be an
m-dimensional manifold. Given a point p ∈ M we say that M is geodesically complete at p iff, for every tangent vector v ∈ Tp M , there exists a
geodesic γ : R → M (on the entire real axis) satisfying γ(0) = p and γ̇(0) = v
(or equivalently Vp = Tp M where Vp ⊂ Tp M is defined by (4.3.5)). The manifold M is called geodesically complete iff it is geodesically complete at
every point p ∈ M .
Definition 4.6.2. Let (M, d) be a metric space. A subset A ⊂ M is called
bounded iff
sup d(p, p0 ) < ∞
p∈A

for some (and hence every) point p0 ∈ M .
Example 4.6.3. A manifold M ⊂ Rn can be contained in a bounded subset
of Rn and still not be bounded with respect to the metric (4.2.2). An
example is the 1-manifold M = (x, y) ∈ R2 | 0 < x < 1, y = sin(1/x) .
Exercise 4.6.4. Let (M, d) be a metric space. Prove that every compact
subset K ⊂ M is closed and bounded. Find an example of a metric space
that contains a closed and bounded subset that is not compact.

210

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

Theorem 4.6.5 (Completeness). Let M ⊂ Rn be a connected m-dimensional manifold and let d : M × M → [0, ∞) be the distance function defined
by (4.1.1), (4.2.1), and (4.2.2). Then the following are equivalent.
(i) M is geodesically complete.
(ii) There exists a point p ∈ M such that M is geodesically complete at p.
(iii) Every closed and bounded subset of M is compact.
(iv) (M, d) is a complete metric space.
(v) M is complete, i.e. for every smooth curve ξ : R → Rm and every element (p0 , e0 ) ∈ F(M ) there exists a smooth curve β : R → F(M ) satisfying
β̇(t) = Bξ(t) (β(t)),

β(0) = (p0 , e0 ).

(4.6.1)

(vi) The basic vector field Bξ ∈ Vect(F(M )) is complete for every ξ ∈ Rm .
(vii) For every smooth curve γ ′ : R → Rm , every p0 ∈ M , and every orthogonal isomorphism Φ0 : Tp0 M → Rm there exists a development (Φ, γ, γ ′ )
of M along Rm on all of R that satisfies γ(0) = p0 and Φ(0) = Φ0 .
Proof. The proof relies on Theorem 4.6.6 below.

Global Existence of Minimal Geodesics
Theorem 4.6.6 (Hopf–Rinow). Let M ⊂ Rn be a connected m-manifold
and let p ∈ M . Assume M is geodesically complete at p. Then, for every q ∈ M , there exists a geodesic γ : [0, 1] → M such that
γ(0) = p,

γ(1) = q,

L(γ) = d(p, q).

Before giving the proof of the Hopf–Rinow Theorem we show that it
implies Theorem 4.6.5.
Theorem 4.6.6 implies Theorem 4.6.5. That (i) implies (ii) follows directly
from the definitions.
We prove that (ii) implies (iii). Thus assume that M is geodesically
complete at the point p0 ∈ M and let K ⊂ M be a closed and bounded
subset. Then r := supq∈K d(p0 , q) < ∞. Hence Theorem 4.6.6 asserts that,
for every q ∈ K, there exists a vector v ∈ Tp0 M such that |v| = d(p0 , q) ≤ r
and expp0 (v) = q. Thus
K ⊂ expp0 (B r (p0 )),

B r (p0 ) = {v ∈ Tp0 M | |v| ≤ r} .

Then B := {v ∈ Tp0 M | |v| ≤ r, expp0 (v) ∈ K} is a closed and bounded subset of the Euclidean space Tp0 M . Hence B is compact and K = expp0 (B).
Since the exponential map expp0 : Tp0 M → M is continuous it follows that K
is compact. This shows that (ii) implies (iii).

4.6. COMPLETENESS AND HOPF–RINOW

211

We prove that (iii) implies (iv). Thus assume that every closed and
bounded subset of M is compact and choose a Cauchy sequence pi ∈ M .
Choose i0 ∈ N such that d(pi , pj ) ≤ 1 for all i, j ∈ N with i, j ≥ i0 . Define
c := max d(p1 , pi ) + 1.
1≤i≤i0

Then d(p1 , pi ) ≤ d(p1 , pi0 ) + d(pi0 , pi ) ≤ d(p1 , pi0 ) + 1 ≤ c for all i ≥ i0 and
so d(p1 , pi ) ≤ c for all i ∈ N. Hence the set {pi | i ∈ N} is bounded and so
is its closure. By (iii) this implies that the sequence pi has a convergent
subsequence. Since pi is a Cauchy sequence, this implies that pi converges.
Thus we have proved that (iii) implies (iv).
We prove that (iv) implies (v). Fix a smooth curve ξ : R → Rm and
an element (p0 , e0 ) ∈ F(M ). Assume, by contradiction, that there exists
a real number T > 0 such that there exists a solution β : [0, T ) → F(M )
of equation (4.6.1) that cannot be extended to the interval [0, T + ε) for
any ε > 0. Write β(t) =: (γ(t), e(t)) so that γ and e satisfy the equations
γ̇(t) = e(t)ξ(t),

ė(t) = hγ(t) (γ̇(t))e(t),

γ(0) = p0 ,

e(0) = e0 .

⊥ M for all η ∈ Rm and therefore
This implies e(t)η ∈ Tγ(t) M and ė(t)η ∈ Tγ(t)

for all η, ζ ∈ Rm and all t ∈ [0, T ). Thus the function t 7→ e(t)T e(t) is constant, hence
e(t)T e(t) = eT

|γ̇(t)| = |e(t)ξ(t)| ≤ ∥e0 ∥ |ξ(t)| ≤ ∥e0 ∥ sup |ξ(s)| =: cT
0≤s≤T

and so d(γ(s), γ(t)) ≤ L(γ|[s,t] ) ≤ (t − s)cT for 0 ≤ s < t < T . Since (M, d)
is a complete metric space, this shows that the limit p1 := limt↗T γ(t) ∈ M
exists. Thus the set K := γ([0, T )) ∪ {p1 } ⊂ M is compact and so is the set

By equation (4.6.2) the curve [0, T ) → R × F(M ) : t 7→ (t, γ(t), e(t)) takes
e and is the integral curve of a vector field
values in the compact set [0, T ] × K
on the manifold R × F(M ). Hence Corollary 2.4.15 asserts that [0, T ) cannot
be the maximal existence interval of this integral curve, a contradiction. This
shows that (iv) implies (v).

212

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

That (v) implies (vi) follows by taking ξ(t) ≡ ξ in (v).
We prove that (vi) implies (i). Fix an element p0 ∈ M and a tangent vector v0 ∈ Tp0 M . Let e0 ∈ Liso (Rm , Tp0 M ) be any isomorphism and
choose ξ ∈ Rm such that e0 ξ = v0 . By (vi) the vector field Bξ has a unique
integral curve R → F(M ) : t 7→ β(t) = (γ(t), e(t)) with
β(0) = (p0 , e0 ).
Thus
γ̇(t) = e(t)ξ,

ė(t) = hγ(t) (e(t)ξ)e(t),

and hence
γ̈(t) = ė(t)ξ = hγ(t) (e(t)ξ)e(t)ξ = hγ(t) (γ̇(t), γ̇(t)).
By the Gauß–Weingarten formula, this implies ∇γ̇(t) = 0 for every t and
hence γ : R → M is a geodesic with γ(0) = p0 and γ̇(0) = e0 ξ = v0 . Thus M
is geodesically complete and this shows that (vi) implies (i).
The equivalence of (v) and (vii) was established in Corollary 3.5.25 and
this shows that Theorem 4.6.6 implies Theorem 4.6.5.

Proof of the Hopf–Rinow Theorem
The proof of Theorem 4.6.6 relies on the next two lemmas.
Lemma 4.6.7. Let M ⊂ Rn be a connected m-manifold and p ∈ M . Suppose ε > 0 is smaller than the injectivity radius of M at p and denote

Σ1 (p) := {v ∈ Tp M | |v| = 1} ,
Sε (p) := p′ ∈ M | d(p, p′ ) = ε .
Then the map Σ1 (p) → Sε (p) : v 7→ expp (εv) is a diffeomorphism and, for
all q ∈ M , we have
d(p, q) > ε

=⇒

d(Sε (p), q) = d(p, q) − ε.

Proof. By Theorem 4.4.4, we have
d(p, expp (v)) = |v|

for all v ∈ Tp M with |v| ≤ ε

and
d(p, p′ ) > ε


for all p′ ∈ M \ expp (v) | v ∈ Tp M, |v| ≤ ε .

This shows that Sε (p) = expp (εΣ1 (p)) and, since ε is smaller than the injectivity radius, the map
Σ1 (p) → Sε (p) : v 7→ expp (εv)
is a diffeomorphism.

4.6. COMPLETENESS AND HOPF–RINOW

213

To prove the second assertion, let q ∈ M such that
r := d(p, q) > ε.
Fix a constant δ > 0 and choose a smooth curve γ : [0, 1] → M such that
γ(0) = p,

γ(1) = q,

L(γ) ≤ r + δ.

Choose t0 > 0 such that γ(t0 ) is the last point of the curve on Sε (p), i.e.
γ(t0 ) ∈ Sε (p),

γ(t) ∈
/ Sε (p) for t0 < t ≤ 1.

Then
d(γ(t0 ), q) ≤ L(γ|[t0 ,1] )
= L(γ) − L(γ|[0,t0 ] )
≤ L(γ) − ε
≤ r + δ − ε.
This shows that d(Sε (p), q) ≤ r + δ − ε for every δ > 0 and therefore
d(Sε (p), q) ≤ r − ε.
Moreover,
d(p′ , q) ≥ d(p, q) − d(p, p′ ) = r − ε
for all p′ ∈ Sε (p). Thus
d(Sε (p), q) = r − ε
and this proves Lemma 4.6.7.
Lemma 4.6.8 (Curve Shortening Lemma). Let M ⊂ Rn be an m-manifold, let p ∈ M , and let ε be a real number such that
0 < ε < inj(p; M ).
Then, for all v, w ∈ Tp M , we have
|v| = |w| = ε,

d(expp (v), expp (w)) = 2ε

=⇒

v + w = 0.

Assume this holds and suppose, by contradiction, that there exist two tangent vectors v, w ∈ Tp M such that
|v| = |w| = 1,

d(expp (εv), expp (εw)) = 2ε,

v + w ̸= 0.

Then
|v − w| < 2
(see Figure 4.7). Thus by (4.6.3) there exists a constant 0 < δ < ε such that
d(expp (δv), expp (δw)) < 2δ.
Then
d(expp (εv), expp (εw))
≤ d(expp (εv), expp (δv)) + d(expp (δv), expp (δw)) + d(expp (δw), expp (εw))
< ε − δ + 2δ + ε − δ = 2ε
and this contradicts our assumption.
It remains to prove (4.6.3). For this we observe that

4.6. COMPLETENESS AND HOPF–RINOW

215

Proof of Theorem 4.6.6. By assumption M ⊂ Rn is a connected submanifold, and p ∈ M is given such that the exponential map expp : Tp M → M is
defined on the entire tangent space at p. Fix a point q ∈ M \ {p} so that
0 < r := d(p, q) < ∞.
Choose a constant ε > 0 smaller than the injectivity radius of M at p and
smaller than r. Then, by Lemma 4.6.7, we have
d(Sε (p), q) = r − ε.
Hence there exists a tangent vector v ∈ Tp M such that
d(expp (εv), q) = r − ε,

|v| = 1.

Define the curve γ : [0, r] → M by
γ(t) := expp (tv)

for 0 ≤ t ≤ r.

By Lemma 4.3.6, this is a geodesic and it satisfies γ(0) = p. We must
prove that γ(r) = q and L(γ) = d(p, q). Instead we will prove the following stronger statement.
Claim. For every t ∈ [0, r] we have
d(γ(t), q) = r − t.
In particular, γ(r) = q and L(γ) = r = d(p, q).
Consider the subset
I := {t ∈ [0, r] | d(γ(t), q) = r − t} ⊂ [0, r].
This set is nonempty, because ε ∈ I, it is obviously closed, and
t∈I

=⇒

[0, t] ⊂ I.

Namely, if t ∈ I and 0 ≤ s ≤ t, then
d(γ(s), q) ≤ d(γ(s), γ(t)) + d(γ(t), q) ≤ t − s + r − t = r − s
and
d(γ(s), q) ≥ d(p, q) − d(p, γ(s)) ≥ r − s.
Hence d(γ(s), q) = r − s and hence s ∈ I. This proves (4.6.4).

(4.6.4)

216

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

We prove that I is open (in the relative topology of [0, r]). Let t ∈ I
be given with t < r. Choose a constant ε > 0 smaller than the injectivity
radius of M at γ(t) and smaller than r − t. Then, by Lemma 4.6.7 with p
replaced by γ(t), we have
d(Sε (γ(t)), q) = r − t − ε.
Next we choose w ∈ Tγ(t) M such that
|w| = 1,

d(expγ(t) (εw), q) = r − t − ε.

Then
d(γ(t − ε), expγ(t) (εw)) ≥ d(γ(t − ε), q) − d(expγ(t) (εw), q)
= (r − t + ε) − (r − t − ε)
= 2ε.
The converse inequality is obvious, because both points have distance ε
to γ(t) (see Figure 4.8).

Figure 4.8: The proof of the Hopf–Rinow theorem.
Thus we have proved that
d(γ(t − ε), expγ(t) (εw)) = 2ε.
Since
γ(t − ε) = expγ(t) (−εγ̇(t)),
it follows from Lemma 4.6.8 that
w = γ̇(t).
Hence expγ(t) (sw) = γ(t + s) and this implies that
d(γ(t + ε), q) = r − t − ε.
Thus t + ε ∈ I and, by (4.6.4), we have [0, t + ε] ∈ I. Thus we have proved
that I is open. In other words, I is a nonempty subset of [0, r] which is
both open and closed, and hence I = [0, r]. This proves the claim and
Theorem 4.6.6.

Geodesics in the Intrinsic Setting*

This section examines the distance function on a Riemannian manifold,
shows how the results of this chapter extend to the intrinsic setting, and
discusses several examples.

4.7.1

Intrinsic Distance

Let M be a connected smooth manifold (§2.8) equipped with a Riemannian
metric (§3.7). Then we can define the length of a curve γ : [0, 1] → M
by the formula (4.1.1) and it is invariant under reparametrization as in
Remark 4.1.3. The distance function d : M × M → R is then given by
the same formula (4.2.2). We prove that it still defines a metric on M and
that this metric induces the same topology as the smooth structure.
Lemma 4.7.1. Let M be a connected smooth Riemannian manifold and
define the function d : M × M → [0, ∞) by (4.1.1), (4.2.1), and (4.2.2).
Then d is a metric and induces the same topology as the smooth structure.
Proof. The proof has three steps.
Step 1. Fix a point p0 ∈ M and let ϕ : U → Ω be a coordinate chart of M
onto an open subset Ω ⊂ Rm such that p0 ∈ U . Then there exists an open
neighborhood V ⊂ U of p0 and constants δ, r > 0 such that
δ |ϕ(p) − ϕ(p0 )| ≤ d(p, p0 ) ≤ δ −1 |ϕ(p) − ϕ(p0 )|

(4.7.1)

for every p ∈ V and d(p, p0 ) ≥ δr for every p ∈ M \ V .
Denote the inverse of the coordinate chart ϕ by ψ := ϕ−1 : Ω → M and
m×m by
define the map g = (gij )m

∂ψ

gij (x) :=

Z 1q
L(γ) =
ċ(t)T g(c(t))ċ(t) dt,
c(t) := ϕ(γ(t)).

(4.7.2)

0

Let x0 := ϕ(p0 ) ∈ Ω and choose r > 0 such that B r (x0 ) ⊂ Ω. Then there is
a constant δ ∈ (0, 1] such that
q
δ |ξ| ≤ ξ T g(x)ξ ≤ δ −1 |ξ|
(4.7.3)
for all x ∈ Br (x0 ) and ξ, η ∈ Rm . Define V := ϕ−1 (Br (x0 )) ⊂ U .

218

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS

Now let p ∈ V and denote x := ϕ(p) ∈ Br (x0 ). Then, for every smooth
curve γ : [0, 1] → V with γ(0) = p0 and γ(1) = p, the curve
c := ϕ ◦ γ
takes values in Br (x0 ) and satisfies c(0) = x0 and c(1) = x. Hence, by (4.7.2)
and (4.7.3), we have
Z 1
Z 1
|ċ(t)| dt ≥ δ
ċ(t) dt = δ |x − x0 | .
L(γ) ≥ δ
0

0

If γ : [0, 1] → M is a smooth curve with endpoints γ(0) = p0 and γ(1) = p
whose image is not entirely contained in V , then there exists a T ∈ (0, 1]
such that γ(t) ∈ V for 0 ≤ t < T and γ(T ) ∈ ∂V , so c(t) = ϕ(γ(t)) ∈ Br (x0 )
for 0 ≤ t < T and |c(T ) − x0 | = r. Hence, by the above argument, we have
L(γ) ≥ δr.
This shows that d(p0 , p) ≥ δr for p ∈ M \ V and d(p0 , p) ≥ δ |ϕ(p) − ϕ(p0 )|
for p ∈ V . If p ∈ V , x := ϕ(p), and c(t) := x0 + t(x − x0 ), then γ := ψ ◦ c is a
smooth curve in V with γ(0) = p0 and γ(1) = p and, by (4.7.2) and (4.7.3),
Z 1
−1
|ċ(t)| dt = δ −1 |x − x0 | .
L(γ) ≤ δ
0

This proves Step 1.
Step 2. d is a distance function.
Step 1 shows that d(p, p0 ) > 0 for every p ∈ M \ {p0 } and hence d satisfies
condition (i) in Lemma 4.2.3. The proofs of (ii) and (iii) remain unchanged
in the intrinsic setting and this proves Step 2.
Step 3. The topology on M induced by d agrees with the topology induced
by the smooth structure.
Assume first that W ⊂ M is open with respect to the manifold topology
and let p0 ∈ W . Let ϕ : U → Ω be a coordinate chart of M onto an open
subset Ω ⊂ Rm such that p0 ∈ U , and choose V ⊂ U and δ, r as in Step 1.
Then ϕ(V ∩ W ) is an open subset of Ω containing the point ϕ(p0 ). Hence
there exists a constant 0 < ε ≤ δr such that Bδ−1 ε (ϕ(p0 )) ⊂ ϕ(V ∩ W ).
Thus by Step 1 we have d(p, p0 ) ≥ δr ≥ ε for all p ∈ M \ V . Hence, if p ∈ M
satisfies d(p, p0 ) < ε, then p ∈ V , so |ϕ(p) − ϕ(p0 )| < δ −1 d(p, p0 ) < δ −1 ε
by (4.7.1), and therefore ϕ(p) ∈ ϕ(V ∩ W ). Thus Bε (p0 ; d) ⊂ W and this
shows that W is open with respect to d.

4.7. GEODESICS IN THE INTRINSIC SETTING*

219

Conversely, assume that W ⊂ M is open with respect to d and choose
a coordinate chart ϕ : U → Ω onto an open set Ω ⊂ Rm . We must prove
that ϕ(W ∩ U ) is an open subset of Ω. To see this, choose x0 ∈ ϕ(W ∩ U )
and let p0 := ϕ−1 (x0 ) ∈ W ∩ U . Now choose V ⊂ U and δ, r as in Step 1.
Choose ε > 0 such that Bδ−1 ε (p0 ; d) ⊂ W and Bε (x0 ) ⊂ ϕ(V ). Let x ∈ Rn
such that |x − x0 | < ε. Then x ∈ ϕ(V ) and therefore p := ϕ−1 (x) ∈ V . This
implies d(p, p0 ) < δ −1 |ϕ(p) − ϕ(p0 )| = δ −1 |x − x0 | < δ −1 ε, thus p ∈ W ∩ U ,
and so x = ϕ(p) ∈ ϕ(W ∩ U ). Thus ϕ(W ∩ U ) is open, and so W is open in
the manifold topology of M . This proves Step 3 and Lemma 4.7.1.

4.7.2

Geodesics and the Levi-Civita Connection

With the covariant derivative understood (Theorem 3.7.8), we can define
geodesics on M as smooth curves γ : I → M that satisfy the equation
∇γ̇ = 0, as in Definition 4.1.5. Then all the above results about geodesics,
as well as their proofs, carry over almost verbatim to the intrinsic setting. In
particular, geodesics are in local coordinates described by equation (4.3.6)
(Lemma 4.3.14) and they are the critical points of the energy functional

E(γ) :=

Z 1

|γ̇(t)|2 dt

on the space Ωp,q of all paths γ : [0, 1] → M with fixed endpoints γ(0) = p
and γ(1) = q. Here we use the fact that Lemma 4.1.7 extends to the intrinsic setting via the Embedding Theorem 2.9.12. So for every vector
field X ∈ Vect(γ) along γ with X(0) = 0 and X(1) = 0 there exists a curve
of curves R → Ωp,q : s 7→ γs with γ0 = γ and ∂s γs |s=0 = X. Then, by the
properties of the Levi-Civita connection, we have
Z

dE(γ)X =
∂s |∂t γs (t)|2 dt

Z 1
=
⟨γ̇(t), ∇t X(t)⟩ dt

Z 1
=−
⟨∇t γ̇(t), X(t)⟩ dt.
0

The right hand side vanishes for all X if and only if ∇γ̇ ≡ 0 (Theorem 4.1.4).
With this understood, we find that, for all p ∈ M and v ∈ Tp M , there exists a
unique geodesic γ : Ip,v → M on a maximal open interval Ip,v ⊂ R containing
zero that satisfies γ(0) = p and γ̇(0) = v (Lemma 4.3.4).

220

CHAPTER 4. GEODESICS
This gives rise to a smooth exponential map
expp : Vp = {v ∈ Tp M | 1 ∈ Ip,v } → M

as in §4.3 which satisfies
d expp (0) = id : Tp M → Tp M
as in Corollary 4.3.7. This leads directly to the injectivity radius, the Gauß
Lemma 4.4.5, the local length minimizing property of geodesics in Theorem 4.4.4, and the Convex Neighborhood Theorem 4.5.3. Also the proof of
the equivalence of metric and geodesic completeness in Theorem 4.6.5 and of
the Hopf–Rinow Theorem 4.6.6 carry over verbatim to the intrinsic setting
of general Riemannian manifolds. The only place where some care must be
taken is in the proof of the Curve Shortening Lemma 4.6.8 as is spelled out
in Exercise 4.7.2 below.

Chapter 5

Curvature
This chapter begins by introducing the notion of an isometry (§5.1). It
shows that isometries of embedded manifolds preserve the lengths of curves
and can be characterized as diffeomorphisms whose derivatives preserve the
inner products. The chapter then moves on to the Riemann curvature tensor
and establishes its symmetry properties (§5.2). That section also includes
a discussion of the covariant derivative of a global vector field. The next
section is devoted to the generalized Gauß Theorema Egregium which asserts that isometries preserve geodesics, the covariant derivative, and the
Riemann curvature tensor (§5.3). The final section examines the Riemann
curvature tensor in local coordinates and shows how the definitions and results of the present chapter carry over to the intrinsic setting of Riemannian
manifolds (§5.4).

5.1

Isometries

Let M and M ′ be connected submanifolds of Rn . An isometry is an isomorphism of the intrinsic geometries of M and M ′ . Recall the definition of the
intrinsic distance function
d : M × M → [0, ∞)
in §4.2 by
Z 1
d(p, q) := inf L(γ),
γ∈Ωp,q

|γ̇(t)| dt

L(γ) =

for p, q ∈ M . Let d′ denote the intrinisic distance function on M ′ .
223

224

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

Theorem 5.1.1 (Isometries). Let ϕ : M → M ′ be a bijective map. Then
the following are equivalent.
(i) ϕ intertwines the distance functions on M and M ′ , i.e.
d′ (ϕ(p), ϕ(q)) = d(p, q)
for all p, q ∈ M .
(ii) ϕ is a diffeomorphism and
dϕ(p) : Tp M → Tϕ(p) M ′
is an orthogonal isomorphism for every p ∈ M .
(iii) ϕ is a diffeomorphism and
L(ϕ ◦ γ) = L(γ)
for every smooth curve γ : [a, b] → M .
The bijection ϕ is called an isometry iff it satisfies these equivalent conditions. In the case M = M ′ the isometries ϕ : M → M form a group denoted
by I(M ) and called the isometry group of M .
The proof is based on the following lemma.
Lemma 5.1.2. For every p ∈ M there exists a constant ε > 0 such that,
for all v, w ∈ Tp M with 0 < |w| < |v| < ε, we have
d(expp (w), expp (v)) = |v| − |w|

=⇒

w=

|w|
v.
|v|

(5.1.1)

Remark 5.1.3. It follows from the triangle inequality and Theorem 4.4.4
that
d(expp (v), expp (w)) ≥ d(expp (v), p) − d(expp (w), p)
= |v| − |w|
whenever 0 < |w| < |v| < inj(p). Lemma 5.1.2 asserts that equality can
only hold when w is a positive multiple of v or, to put it differently, that the
distance between expp (v) and expp (w) must be strictly bigger that |v| − |w|
whenever w is not a positive multiple of v.

5.1. ISOMETRIES

225

Proof of Lemma 5.1.2. As in Corollary 4.3.8 we denote
Bε (p) := {v ∈ Tp M | |v| < ε} ,
Uε (p) := {q ∈ M | d(p, q) < ε} .
By Theorem 4.4.4 and the definition of the injectivity radius, the exponential
map at p is a diffeomorphism expp : Bε (p) → Uε (p) for ε < inj(p). Choose
0 < r < inj(p). Then the closure of Ur (p) is a compact subset of M . Hence
there is a constant ε > 0 such that ε < r and ε < inj(p′ ) for every p′ ∈ Ur (p).
Since ε < r we have
ε < inj(p′ )

∀ p′ ∈ Uε (p).

(5.1.2)

Thus expp′ : Bε (p′ ) → Uε (p′ ) is a diffeomorphism for every p′ ∈ Uε (p).
Define p1 := expp (w) and p2 := expp (v). Then, by assumption, we have
d(p1 , p2 ) = |v| − |w| < ε. Since p1 ∈ Uε (p) it follows from our choice of ε that
ε < inj(p1 ). Hence there is a unique tangent vector v1 ∈ Tp1 M such that
|v1 | = d(p1 , p2 ) = |v| − |w| ,

expp1 (v1 ) = p2 .

Following first the shortest geodesic from p to p1 and then the shortest
geodesic from p1 to p2 we obtain (after suitable reparametrization) a smooth
curve γ : [0, 2] → M such that
γ(0) = p,

γ(1) = p1 ,

γ(2) = p2 ,

and
L(γ|[0,1] ) = d(p, p1 ) = |w| ,

L(γ|[1,2] ) = d(p1 , p2 ) = |v| − |w| .

Thus L(γ) = |v| = d(p, p2 ). Hence, by Theorem 4.4.4, there is a smooth
function β : [0, 2] → [0, 1] satisfying
β(0) = 0,

β(2) = 1,

β̇(t) ≥ 0,

γ(t) = expp (β(t)v)

for every t ∈ [0, 2]. This implies
expp (w) = p1 = γ(1) = expp (β(1)v),

0 ≤ β(1) ≤ 1.

Since w and β(1)v are both elements of Bε (p) and expp is injective on Bε (p),
this implies w = β(1)v. Since β(1) ≥ 0 we have β(1) = |w| / |v|. This
proves (5.1.1) and Lemma 5.1.2.

In the third equation we have used (ii). That (iii) implies (i) follows immediately from the definition of the intrinsic distance functions d and d′ .
We prove that (i) implies (ii). Fix a point p ∈ M and choose ε > 0
so small that ε < min{inj(p; M ), inj(ϕ(p); M ′ )} and that the assertion of
Lemma 5.1.2 holds for the point p′ := ϕ(p) ∈ M ′ . Then there is a unique
homeomorphism Φp : Bε (p) → Bε (ϕ(p)) such that the following diagram

Here the vertical maps are diffeomorphisms and ϕ : Uε (p) → Uε (ϕ(p)) is a

Equation (5.1.3) holds by definition. To prove (5.1.4) we observe that, by

|Φp (v)| = d′ (ϕ(p), exp′ϕ(p) (Φp (v)))
= d′ (ϕ(p), ϕ(expp (v)))
= d(p, expp (v))

Here the second equation follows from (5.1.3) and the third equation from (i).
Equation (5.1.5) holds for t = 0 because Φp (0) = 0 and for t = 1 it is a
tautology. Hence assume 0 < t < 1. Then
d′ (exp′ϕ(p) (Φp (tv)), exp′ϕ(p) (Φp (v))) = d′ (ϕ(expp (tv)), ϕ(expp (v)))

Here the first equation follows from (5.1.3), the second equation from (i),
the third equation from Theorem 4.4.4 and the fact that |v| < inj(p), and
the last equation follows from (5.1.4). Since 0 < |Φp (tv)| < |Φp (v)| < ε we
can apply Lemma 5.1.2 and obtain
Φp (tv) =

|Φp (tv)|
Φp (v) = tΦp (v).
|Φp (v)|

This proves Claim 1.
By Claim 1, Φp extends to a bijective map Φp : Tp M → Tϕ(p) M ′ via
1
Φp (v) := Φp (δv),
δ
where δ > 0 is chosen so small that δ |v| < ε. The right hand side of
this equation is independent of the choice of δ. Hence the extension is well
defined. It is bijective because the original map Φp is a bijection from Bε (p)
to Bε (ϕ(p)). The reader may verify that the extended map satisfies the
conditions (5.1.4) and (5.1.5) for all v ∈ Tp M and all t ≥ 0.
Claim 2. The extended map Φp : Tp M → Tϕ(p) M ′ is linear and preserves
the inner product.
It follows from the equation (4.6.3) in the proof of Lemma 4.6.8 that
d(expp (tv), expp (tw))

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

Here the second equation follows from (i), the third from (5.1.3), the fourth
from (5.1.4), and the last equation follows again from (4.6.3). By polarization we obtain
2⟨v, w⟩ = |v|2 + |w|2 − |v − w|2
= |Φp (v)|2 + |Φp (w)|2 − |Φp (v) − Φp (w)|2
= 2⟨Φp (v), Φp (w)⟩.
Thus Φp preserves the inner product. Hence, for all v1 , v2 , w ∈ Tp M , we
have
⟨Φp (v1 + v2 ), Φp (w)⟩ = ⟨v1 + v2 , w⟩
= ⟨v1 , w⟩ + ⟨v2 , w⟩
= ⟨Φp (v1 ), Φp (w)⟩ + ⟨Φp (v2 ), Φp (w)⟩
= ⟨Φp (v1 ) + Φp (v2 ), Φp (w)⟩.
Since Φp is surjective, this implies
Φp (v1 + v2 ) = Φp (v1 ) + Φp (v2 )
for all v1 , v2 ∈ Tp M . With v1 = v and v2 = −v we obtain
Φp (−v) = −Φp (v)
for every v ∈ Tp M and by (5.1.5) this gives
Φp (tv) = tΦp (v)
for all v ∈ Tp M and t ∈ R. This proves Claim 2.
Claim 3. ϕ is smooth and dϕ(p) = Φp .
By (5.1.3) we have
ϕ = exp′ϕ(p) ◦Φp ◦ exp−1
p : Uε (p) → Uε (ϕ(p)).
Since Φp is linear, this shows that the restriction of ϕ to the open set Uε (p)
is smooth. Moreover, for every v ∈ Tp M we have
dϕ(p)v =

d
d
ϕ(expp (tv)) =
exp′ϕ(p) (tΦp (v)) = Φp (v).
dt t=0
dt t=0

Here we have used equations (5.1.3) and (5.1.5) as well as Lemma 4.3.6.
This proves Claim 3 and Theorem 5.1.1.

5.1. ISOMETRIES

229

Exercise 5.1.4. Prove that every isometry ψ : Rn → Rn is an affine map
ψ(p) = Ap + b
where A ∈ O(n) and b ∈ Rn . Thus ψ is a composition of translation and
rotation. Hint: Let e1 , . . . , en be the standard basis of Rn . Prove that any
two vectors v, w ∈ Rn that satisfy
|v| = |w|
and
|v − ei | = |w − ei |

for i = 1, . . . , n

must be equal.
Remark 5.1.5. If ψ : Rn → Rn is an isometry of the ambient Euclidean
space with ψ(M ) = M ′ , then certainly ϕ := ψ|M is an isometry from M
onto M ′ . On the other hand, if M is a plane manifold
M = {(0, y, z) ∈ R3 | 0 < y < π/2}
and M ′ is the cylindrical manifold
M ′ = {(x, y, z) ∈ R3 | x2 + y 2 = 1, x > 0, y > 0},
Then the map ϕ : M → M ′ defined by
ϕ(0, y, z) := (cos(y), sin(y), z)
is an isometry which is not of the form ϕ = ψ|M . Indeed, an isometry of the
form ϕ = ψ|M necessarily preserves the second fundamental form (as well
as the first) in the sense that
dψ(p)hp (v, w) = h′ψ(p) (dψ(p)v, dψ(p)w)
for v, w ∈ Tp M but in the example h vanishes identically while h′ does not.
We may thus distinguish two fundamental question:
I. Given M and M ′ when are they extrinsically isomorphic, i.e. when is
there an ambient isometry ψ : Rn → Rn with ψ(M ) = M ′ ?
II. Given M and M ′ when are they intrinsically isomorphic, i.e. when is
there an isometry ϕ : M → M ′ from M onto M ′ ?

230

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

As we have noted, both the first and second fundamental forms are
preserved by extrinsic isomorphisms while only the first fundamental form
need be preserved by an intrinsic isomorphism (i.e. an isometry).
A question which occurred to Gauß (who worked for a while as a cartographer) is this: Can one draw a perfectly accurate map of a portion of the
earth? (i.e. a map for which the distance between points on the map is proportional to the distance between the corresponding points on the surface
of the earth). We can now pose this question as follows: Is there an isometry from an open subset of a sphere to an open subset of a plane? Gauß
answered this question negatively by associating an invariant, the Gaußian
curvature K : M → R, to a surface M ⊂ R3 . According to his Theorema
Egregium
K′ ◦ ϕ = K
for an isometry ϕ : M → M ′ . The sphere has positive curvature; the plane
has zero curvature; hence the perfectly accurate map does not exist. Our
aim is to explain these ideas.

Local Isometries
We shall need a concept slightly more general than that of “isometry”.
Definition 5.1.6 (Local isometry). A smooth map ϕ : M → M ′ is called
a local isometry iff its derivative
dϕ(p) : Tp M → Tϕ(p) M ′
is an orthogonal linear isomorphism for every p ∈ M .
′

Remark 5.1.7. Let M ⊂ Rn and M ′ ⊂ Rn be manifolds and ϕ : M → M ′
be a map. The following are equivalent.
(i) ϕ is a local isometry.
(ii) For every p ∈ M there are open neighborhoods U ⊂ M and U ′ ⊂ M ′
such that the restriction of ϕ to U is an isometry from U onto U ′ .
That (ii) implies (i) follows immediately from Theorem 5.1.1. On the other
hand (i) implies that dϕ(p) is invertible so that (ii) follows from the inverse
function theorem.
Example 5.1.8. The map
R → S 1 : θ 7→ eiθ
is a local isometry but not an isometry.

5.1. ISOMETRIES

Exercise 5.1.9. Let M ⊂ Rn be a compact connected 1-manifold. Prove
that M is diffeomorphic to the circle S 1 . Define the length of a compact
connected Riemannian 1-manifold. Prove that two compact connected 1manifolds M, M ′ ⊂ Rn are isometric if and only if they have the same
length. Hint: Let γ : R → M be a geodesic with |γ̇(t)| ≡ 1. Show that
γ is not injective; otherwise construct an open cover of M without finite
subcover. If t0 < t1 with γ(t0 ) = γ(t1 ), show that γ̇(t0 ) = γ̇(t1 ); otherwise
show that γ(t0 + t) = γ(t1 − t) for all t and find a contradiction.
The next result asserts that two local isometries that have the same value
and the same derivative at a single point must agree everywhere, provided
that the domain is connected.
′

Lemma 5.1.10. Let M ⊂ Rn and M ′ ⊂ Rn be smooth m-manifolds and
assume that M is connected. Let ϕ : M → M ′ and ψ : M → M ′ be local
isometries and let p0 ∈ M such that
ϕ(p0 ) = ψ(p0 ) =: p′0 ,

dϕ(p0 ) = dψ(p0 ) : Tp0 M → Tp′0 M ′ .

Then ϕ(p) = ψ(p) for every p ∈ M .
Proof. Define the set
M0 := {p ∈ M | ϕ(p) = ψ(p), dϕ(p) = dψ(p)} .
This set is obviously closed. We prove that M0 is open. Let p ∈ M0 and
choose U ⊂ M and U ′ ⊂ M ′ as in Remark 5.1.7 (ii). Denote
Φp := dϕ(p) = dψ(p) : Tp M → Tp′ M ′ ,

p′ := ϕ(p) = ψ(p)

Then it follows from equation (5.1.3) in the proof of Theorem 5.1.1 that
there exists a constant ε > 0 such that Uε (p) ⊂ U and Uε (p′ ) ⊂ U ′ and
q ∈ Uε (p)

=⇒

ϕ(q) = exp′p′ ◦Φp ◦ exp−1
p (q) = ψ(q).

Hence Uε (p) ⊂ M0 . Thus M0 is open, closed, and nonempty. Since M is
connected it follows that M0 = M and this proves Lemma 5.1.10.
Exercise 5.1.11. (i) If a sequence of local isometries ϕi : M → M ′ converges uniformly to a local isometry ϕ : M → M ′ , then it converges in the
C ∞ topology. Hint: Let p ∈ M . Then every sufficiently small tangent vector v ∈ Tp M satisfies the equation dϕ(p)v = (exp′ϕ(p) )−1 (ϕ(expp (v))). Use
this to prove that dϕi (p) converges to dϕ(p). Deduce that ϕi converges to ϕ
uniformly with all derviatives in a neighborhood of p.
(ii) The C ∞ topology on the space of local isometries from M to M ′ agrees
with the C 0 topology.

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

The Riemann Curvature Tensor

This section defines the Riemann curvature tensor and proves the Gauß–
Codazzi formula (§5.2.1), introduces the covariant derivative of a global
vector field (§5.2.2), expresses the curvature tensor in terms of a global
formula (§5.2.3), establishes its symmetry properties (§5.2.4), and examines
the curvature for a class of Riemannian metrics on Lie groups (§5.2.5).

5.2.1

Definition and Gauß–Codazzi

Let M ⊂ Rn be a smooth manifold and γ : R2 → M be a smooth map.
Denote by (s, t) the coordinates on R2 . Let Z ∈ Vect(γ) be a smooth vector
field along γ, i.e. Z : R2 → Rn is a smooth map such that Z(s, t) ∈ Tγ(s,t) M
for all s and t. The covariant partial derivatives of Z with respect to
the variables s and t are defined by
∇s Z := Π(γ)

∂Z
,
∂s

∇t Z := Π(γ)

∂Z
.
∂t

In particular ∂s γ = ∂γ/∂s and ∂t γ = ∂γ/∂t are vector fields along γ and we
have ∇s ∂t γ − ∇t ∂s γ = 0 as both terms on the left are equal to Π(γ)∂s ∂t γ.
Thus ordinary partial differentiation and covariant partial differentiation
commute. The analogous formula (which results on replacing ∂ by ∇ and γ
by Z) is in general false. Instead we have the following.
Definition 5.2.1. The Riemann curvature tensor assigns to each p ∈ M
the bilinear map Rp : Tp M × Tp M → L(Tp M, Tp M ) characterized by the
equation

Rp (u, v)w = ∇s ∇t Z − ∇t ∇s Z (0, 0)
(5.2.1)
for u, v, w ∈ Tp M where γ : R2 → M is a smooth map and Z ∈ Vect(γ) is a
smooth vector field along γ such that
γ(0, 0) = p,

∂s γ(0, 0) = u,

∂t γ(0, 0) = v,

Z(0, 0) = w. (5.2.2)

We must prove that R is well defined, i.e. that the right hand side of
equation (5.2.1) is independent of the choice of γ and Z. This follows from
the Gauß–Codazzi formula which we prove next. Recall that the second fundamental form can be viewed as a linear map hp : Tp M → L(Tp M, Tp M ⊥ )
and that, for u ∈ Tp M , the linear map hp (u) ∈ L(Tp M, Tp M ⊥ ) and its
dual hp (u)∗ ∈ L(Tp M ⊥ , Tp M ) are given by


hp (u)v = dΠ(p)u v,
hp (u)∗ w = dΠ(p)u w
for v ∈ Tp M and w ∈ Tp M ⊥ .

5.2. THE RIEMANN CURVATURE TENSOR

233

Theorem 5.2.2. The Riemann curvature tensor is well defined and given
by the Gauß–Codazzi formula
Rp (u, v) = hp (u)∗ hp (v) − hp (v)∗ hp (u)

(5.2.3)

for u, v ∈ Tp M .
Proof. Let u, v, w ∈ Tp M and choose a smooth map γ : R2 → M and a
smooth vector field Z along γ such that (5.2.2) holds. Then, by the Gauß–
Weingarten formula (3.2.2), we have
∇t Z = ∂t Z − hγ (∂t γ)Z

= ∂t Z − dΠ(γ)∂t γ Z

= ∂t Z − ∂t Π ◦ γ Z.
Hence


 
∂t Π ◦ γ Z


= ∂s ∂t Z − ∂s ∂t Π ◦ γ Z − ∂t Π ◦ γ ∂s Z



= ∂s ∂t Z − ∂s ∂t Π ◦ γ Z − dΠ(γ)∂t γ ∇s Z + hγ (∂s γ)Z

= ∂s ∂t Z − ∂s ∂t Π ◦ γ Z − hγ (∂t γ)∇s Z − hγ (∂t γ)∗ hγ (∂s γ)Z.

∂s ∇t Z = ∂s ∂t Z − ∂s

Interchanging s and t and taking the difference we obtain
∂s ∇t Z − ∂t ∇s Z = hγ (∂s γ)∗ hγ (∂t γ)Z − hγ (∂t γ)∗ hγ (∂s γ)Z
+ hγ (∂s γ)∇t Z − hγ (∂t γ)∇s Z.
Here the first two terms on the right are tangent to M and the last two
terms on the right are orthogonal to Tγ M . Hence
∇s ∇t Z − ∇t ∇s Z = Π(γ) ∂s ∇t Z − ∂t ∇s Z



= hγ (∂s γ)∗ hγ (∂t γ)Z − hγ (∂t γ)∗ hγ (∂s γ)Z.
Evaluating the right hand side at s = t = 0 we find that

∇s ∇t Z − ∇t ∇s Z (0, 0) = hp (u)∗ hp (v)w − hp (v)∗ hp (u)w.
This proves the Gauß–Codazzi equation and shows that the left hand side
is independent of the choice of γ and Z. This proves Theorem 5.2.2.

5.2.2

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

Covariant Derivative of a Global Vector Field

So far we have only defined the covariant derivatives of vector fields along
curves. The same method can be applied to global vector fields. This leads
to the following definition.
Definition 5.2.3 (Covariant derivative). Let M ⊂ Rn be an m-dimensional submanifold and X be a vector field on M . Fix a point p ∈ M and
a tangent vector v ∈ Tp M . The covariant derivative of X at p in the
direction v is the tangent vector
∇v X(p) := Π(p)dX(p)v ∈ Tp M,
where Π(p) ∈ Rn×n denotes the orthogonal projection onto Tp M .
Remark 5.2.4. Let γ : I → M be a smooth curve on an interval I ⊂ R and
let X ∈ Vect(M ) be a smooth vector field on M . Then X ◦ γ is a smooth
vector field along γ and the covariant derivative of X ◦ γ is related to the
covariant derivative of X by the formula
∇(X ◦ γ)(t) = ∇γ̇(t) X(γ(t)).

(5.2.4)

Remark 5.2.5 (Gauß–Weingarten formula). Differentiating the equation X = ΠX (understood as a function from M to Rn ) and using the
notation ∂v X(p) := dX(p)v for the derivative of X at p in the direction v
we obtain the Gauß–Weingarten formula for global vector fields:
∂v X(p) = ∇v X(p) + hp (v)X(p).

(5.2.5)

Remark 5.2.6 (Levi-Civita connection). Differentiating a vector field Y
on M covariantly in the direction of another vector field X we obtain a vector
field ∇X Y ∈ Vect(M ) defined by
(∇X Y )(p) := ∇X(p) Y (p)
for p ∈ M . This gives rise to a family of linear operators
∇X : Vect(M ) → Vect(M ),
one for each vector field X ∈ Vect(M ), and the assignment
Vect(M ) → L(Vect(M ), Vect(M )) : X 7→ ∇X

(5.2.6)

is itself a linear operator. This linear operator is called the Levi-Civita
connection on the tangent bundle T M .

5.2. THE RIEMANN CURVATURE TENSOR

235

The Levi-Civita connection (5.2.6) satisfies the conditions
∇f X (Y ) = f ∇X Y,

(5.2.7)

∇X (f Y ) = f ∇X Y + (LX f ) Y,

(5.2.8)

LX ⟨Y, Z⟩ = ⟨∇X Y, Z⟩ + ⟨Y, ∇X Z⟩,

(5.2.9)

∇Y X − ∇X Y = [X, Y ]

(5.2.10)

for all X, Y, Z ∈ Vect(M ) and all f ∈ F (M ), where LX f = df ◦ X
and [X, Y ] ∈ Vect(M ) denotes the Lie bracket of the vector fields X and Y .
The conditions (5.2.7) and (5.2.8) assert that the linear operator (5.2.6) is
a connection on the tangent bundle T M , condition (5.2.9) asserts that
the connection (5.2.6) is Riemannian (i.e. it is compatible with the first
fundamental form), and condition (5.2.10) asserts that it is torsion-free.
The next lemma shows that the Levi-Civita connection (5.2.6) is uniquely
determined by (5.2.9) and (5.2.10), and hence is the unique torsion-free
Riemannian connection on the tangent bundle T M .
Lemma 5.2.7 (Uniqueness Lemma). There is a unique linear operator
Vect(M ) → L(Vect(M ), Vect(M )) : X 7→ ∇X
satisfying equations (5.2.9) and (5.2.10) for all X, Y, Z ∈ Vect(M ).
Proof. Existence follows from the properties of the Levi-Civita connection.
We prove uniqueness. Let X 7→ DX be any linear operator from Vect(M )
to L(Vect(M ), Vect(M )) that satisfies (5.2.9) and (5.2.10). Then we have
LX ⟨Y, Z⟩ = ⟨DX Y, Z⟩ + ⟨Y, DX Z⟩,
LY ⟨X, Z⟩ = ⟨DY X, Z⟩ + ⟨X, DY Z⟩,
−LZ ⟨X, Y ⟩ = −⟨DZ X, Y ⟩ − ⟨X, DZ Y ⟩.
Adding these three equations we find
LX ⟨Y, Z⟩ + LY ⟨Z, X⟩ − LZ ⟨X, Y ⟩
= 2⟨DX Y, Z⟩ + ⟨DY X − DX Y, Z⟩
+ ⟨X, DY Z − DZ Y ⟩ + ⟨Y, DX Z − DZ X⟩
= 2⟨DX Y, Z⟩ + ⟨[X, Y ], Z⟩ + ⟨X, [Z, Y ]⟩ + ⟨Y, [Z, X]⟩.
The same equation holds for the Levi-Civita connection and hence
⟨DX Y, Z⟩ = ⟨∇X Y, Z⟩.
This implies DX Y = ∇X Y for all X, Y ∈ Vect(M ).

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

Exercise 5.2.8. In the proof of Lemma 5.2.7 we did not actually use the
assumption that the operator DX : Vect(M ) → Vect(M ) is linear nor that
the operator X 7→ DX is linear. Prove directly that if a map
DX : L(M ) → L(M )
satisfies (5.2.9) for all Y, Z ∈ Vect(M ), then DX is linear. Prove that every
map Vect(M ) → L(Vect(M ), Vect(M )) : X 7→ DX that satisfies (5.2.10) is
linear.

ξ(ϕ(p)) = dϕ(p)X(p)
for p ∈ U . If Y ∈ Vect(M ) is represented by η, then ∇X Y is represented by

A Global Formula

Lemma 5.2.11. For X, Y, Z ∈ Vect(M ) we have
R(X, Y )Z = ∇X ∇Y Z − ∇Y ∇X Z + ∇[X,Y ] Z.

(5.2.13)

Proof. Fix a point p ∈ M . Then the right hand side of equation (5.2.13) at
p remains unchanged if we multiply each of the vector fields X, Y, Z by a
smooth function f : M → [0, 1] that is equal to one near p. Choosing f with
compact support we may therefore assume that the vector fields X and Y
are complete. Let ϕs denote the flow of X and ψ t the flow of Y . Define the
map γ : R2 → M by
γ(s, t) := ϕs ◦ ψ t (p),

s, t ∈ R.

Then
∂s γ = X(γ),

∂t γ = (ϕs∗ Y )(γ).

Hence, by Remark 5.2.4 we have
∇s (Z ◦ γ) = (∇X Z) (γ),


∇t (Z ◦ γ) = ∇ϕs∗ Y Z (γ).

Using Remark 5.2.4 again we obtain


∇s ∇t (Z ◦ γ) = ∇∂s γ ∇ϕs∗ Y Z (γ) + ∇∂s ϕs∗ Y Z (γ),

∇t ∇s (Z ◦ γ) = ∇ϕs∗ Y ∇X Z (γ).
Since
∂
ϕs Y = [X, Y ]
∂s s=0 ∗
and ∂s γ = X(γ), it follows that

∇s ∇t (Z ◦ γ)(0, 0) = ∇X ∇Y Z + ∇[X,Y ] Z (p),

∇t ∇s (Z ◦ γ)(0, 0) = ∇Y ∇X Z (p).
Hence

Rp (X(p), Y (p))Z(p) = ∇s ∇t (Z ◦ γ) − ∇t ∇s (Z ◦ γ) (0, 0)

= ∇X ∇Y Z − ∇Y ∇X Z + ∇[X,Y ] Z (p).
This proves Lemma 5.2.11.

238

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

Remark 5.2.12. Equation (5.2.13) can be written succinctly as
[∇X , ∇Y ] + ∇[X,Y ] = R(X, Y ).

(5.2.14)

This can be contrasted with the equation
[LX , LY ] + L[X,Y ] = 0

(5.2.15)

for the operator LX on the space of real valued functions on M .
Remark 5.2.13. Equation (5.2.13) can be used to define the Riemann
curvature tensor. To do this one must again prove that the right hand side
of equation (5.2.13) at p depends only on the values X(p), Y (p), Z(p) of the
vector fields X, Y, Z at the point p. For this it suffices to prove that the map
Vect(M ) × Vect(M ) × Vect(M ) → Vect(M ) : (X, Y, Z) 7→ R(X, Y )Z
is linear over the Ring F (M ) of smooth real valued functions on M , i.e.
R(f X, Y )Z = R(X, f Y )Z = R(X, Y )f Z = f R(X, Y )Z

(5.2.16)

for X, Y, Z ∈ Vect(M ) and f ∈ F (M ). The formula (5.2.16) follows from
the equations (5.2.7), (5.2.8), (5.2.15), and [X, f Y ] = f [X, Y ] − (LX f )Y. It
follows from (5.2.16) that the right hand side of (5.2.13) at p depends only
on the vectors X(p), Y (p), Z(p). The proof requires two steps. One first
shows that if X vanishes near p, then the right hand side of (5.2.13) vanishes
at p (and similarly for Y and Z). Just multiply X by a smooth function
equal to zero at p and equal to one on the support of X; then f X = X and
hence the vector field R(X, Y )Z = R(f X, Y )Z = f R(X, Y )Z vanishes at p.
Second, we choose a local frame E1 , . . . , Em ∈ Vect(M ), i.e. vector fields
that form a basis of Tp M for each p in some open set U ⊂ M . Then we may
write

Theorem 5.2.14. The Riemann curvature tensor satisfies
R(Y, X) = −R(X, Y ) = R(X, Y )∗ ,

(5.2.17)

R(X, Y )Z + R(Y, Z)X + R(Z, X)Y = 0,

(5.2.18)

⟨R(X, Y )Z, W ⟩ = ⟨R(Z, W )X, Y ⟩

(5.2.19)

for X, Y, Z, W ∈ Vect(M ). Equation (5.2.18) is the first Bianchi identity.
Proof. The first equation in (5.2.17) is obvious from the definition and the
second follows from the Gauß–Codazzi formula (5.2.3). Alternatively, choose
a smooth map γ : R2 → M and two vector fields Z, W along γ. Then
0 = ∂s ∂t ⟨Z, W ⟩ − ∂t ∂s ⟨Z, W ⟩
= ∂s ⟨∇t Z, W ⟩ + ∂s ⟨Z, ∇t W ⟩ − ∂t ⟨∇s Z, W ⟩ − ∂t ⟨Z, ∇s W ⟩
= ⟨∇s ∇t Z, W ⟩ + ⟨Z, ∇s ∇t W ⟩ − ⟨∇t ∇s Z, W ⟩ − ⟨Z, ∇t ∇s W ⟩
= ⟨R(∂s γ, ∂t γ)Z, W ⟩ + ⟨Z, R(∂s γ, ∂t γ)W ⟩.
This proof has the advantage that it carries over to the intrinsic setting. We
prove the first Bianchi identity using (5.2.10) and (5.2.13):
R(X, Y )Z + R(Y, Z)X + R(Z, X)Y
= ∇X ∇Y Z − ∇Y ∇X Z + ∇[X,Y ] Z + ∇Y ∇Z X − ∇Z ∇Y X + ∇[Y,Z] X
+ ∇Z ∇X Y − ∇X ∇Z Y + ∇[Z,X] Y
= ∇[Y,Z] X − ∇X [Y, Z] + ∇[Z,X] Y − ∇Y [Z, X] + ∇[X,Y ] Z − ∇Z [X, Y ]
= [X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z, X]] + [Z, [X, Y ]].
The last term vanishes by the Jacobi identity. We prove (5.2.19) by combining the first Bianchi identity with (5.2.17):
⟨R(X, Y )Z, W ⟩ − ⟨R(Z, W )X, Y ⟩
= −⟨R(Y, Z)X, W ⟩ − ⟨R(Z, X)Y, W ⟩ − ⟨R(Z, W )X, Y ⟩
= ⟨R(Y, Z)W, X⟩ + ⟨R(Z, X)W, Y ⟩ + ⟨R(W, Z)X, Y ⟩
= ⟨R(Y, Z)W, X⟩ − ⟨R(X, W )Z, Y ⟩
= ⟨R(Y, Z)W, X⟩ − ⟨R(W, X)Y, Z⟩.
Note that the first line is related to the last by a cyclic permutation. Repeating this argument we find
⟨R(Y, Z)W, X⟩ − ⟨R(W, X)Y, Z⟩ = ⟨R(Z, W )X, Y ⟩ − ⟨R(X, Y )Z, W ⟩.
Combining the last two identities we obtain (5.2.19). This proves Theorem 5.2.14.

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

Remark 5.2.15. We may think of a vector field X on M as a section of
the tangent bundle. This is reflected in the alternative notation
Ω0 (M, T M ) := Vect(M ).
A 1-form on M with values in the tangent bundle is a collection of
linear maps A(p) : Tp M → Tp M , one for every p ∈ M , which is smooth
in the sense that for every smooth vector field X on M the assignment
p 7→ A(p)X(p) defines again a smooth vector field on M . We denote by
Ω1 (M, T M )
the space of smooth 1-forms on M with values in T M . The covariant derivative of a vector field Y is such a 1-form with values in the tangent bundle
which assigns to every p ∈ M the linear map Tp M → Tp M : v 7→ ∇v Y (p).
Thus we can think of the covariant derivative as a linear operator
∇ : Ω0 (M, T M ) → Ω1 (M, T M ).
The equation (5.2.7) asserts that the operators X 7→ ∇X indeed determine
a linear operator from Ω0 (M, T M ) to Ω1 (M, T M ). Equation (5.2.8) asserts that this linear operator ∇ is a connection on the tangent bundle
of M . Equation (5.2.9) asserts that ∇ is a Riemannian connection and
equation (5.2.10) asserts that ∇ is torsion-free. Thus Lemma 5.2.7 can
be restated as asserting that the Levi-Civita connection is the unique
torsion-free Riemannian connection on the tangent bundle.
Exercise 5.2.16. Extend the notion of a connection to a general vector bundle E, both as a collection of linear operators ∇X : Ω0 (M, E) → Ω0 (M, E),
one for every vector field X ∈ Vect(M ), and as a linear operator
∇ : Ω0 (M, E) → Ω1 (M, E)
satisfying the analogue of equation (5.2.8). Interpret this equation as a Leibniz rule for the product of a function on M with a section of E. Show that
∇⊥ is a connection on T M ⊥ . Extend the notion of curvature to connections
on general vector bundles.
Exercise 5.2.17. Show that the field which assigns to each p ∈ M the
multi-linear map Rp⊥ : Tp M × Tp M → L(Tp M ⊥ , Tp M ⊥ ) characterized by
⊥
⊥ ⊥
R⊥ (∂s γ, ∂t γ)Y = ∇⊥

for p ∈ M and u, v ∈ Tp M .

Riemannian Metrics on Lie Groups

We begin with a calculation of the Riemann curvature tensor on a Lie subgroup of the orthogonal group O(n) with the Riemannian metric inherited
from the standard inner product
⟨v, w⟩ := trace(v T w)

(5.2.20)

on the ambient space gl(n, R) = Rn×n . This fits into the extrinsic setting
used throughout most of this book. Note that every Lie subgroup of O(n)
is a closed subset of O(n) by Theorem 2.5.27 and hence is compact.
Example 5.2.18. Let G ⊂ O(n) be a Lie subgroup and let
g := Lie(G) = T1l G
be the Lie algebra of G. Consider the Riemannian metric on G induced by
the inner product (5.2.20) on Rn×n . Then the Riemann curvature tensor
on G can be expressed in terms of the Lie bracket (see item (d) below).
(a) The maps g 7→ ag, g 7→ ga, g 7→ g −1 are isometries of G for every a ∈ G.
(b) Let γ : R → G be a smooth curve and X ∈ Vect(γ) be a smooth vector
field along γ. Then the covariant derivative of X is given by
γ(t)−1 ∇X(t) =


d
1
γ(t)−1 X(t) +
γ(t)−1 γ̇(t), γ(t)−1 X(t) .

(5.2.21)

(Exercise: Prove equation (5.2.21). Hint: Since g ⊂ o(n) we have the
identity trace((ξη + ηξ)ζ) = 0 for all ξ, η, ζ ∈ g.)
(c) A smooth map γ : R → G is a geodesic if and only if there exist matrices
g ∈ G and ξ ∈ g such that
γ(t) = g exp(tξ).

(5.2.22)

For G = O(n) we have seen this in Example 4.3.12 and in the general
case this follows from equation (5.2.21) with X = γ̇. Hence the exponential
map exp : g → G defined by the exponential matrix (as in §2.5) agrees with
the time-1-map of the geodesic flow (as in §4.3).
(d) The Riemann curvature tensor on G is given by
1
g −1 Rg (u, v)w = − [[g −1 u, g −1 v], g −1 w]

(5.2.23)

for g ∈ G and u, v, w ∈ Tg G. Note that the first Bianchi identity is equivalent
to the Jacobi identity. (Exercise: Prove equation (5.2.23).)

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

Definition 5.2.19 (Bi-invariant Riemannian metric). Let G be a Lie
subgroup of GL(n, R) and let g = Lie(G) = T1l G be its Lie algebra. A Riemannian metric on G is called bi-invariant iff it has the form
⟨v, w⟩g := ⟨vg −1 , wg −1 ⟩

(5.2.24)

for g ∈ G and v, w ∈ Tg G, where ⟨·, ·⟩ is an inner product on the Lie algebra g
that is invariant under conjugation, i.e. it satisfies the equation
⟨ξ, η⟩ = ⟨gξg −1 , gηg −1 ⟩.

(5.2.25)

for all ξ, η ∈ g and all g ∈ G.
Exercise 5.2.20. Prove that the Riemannian metric induced by (5.2.20)
on any Lie subgroup G ⊂ O(n) is bi-invariant.
Exercise 5.2.21. Use the Haar measure ([66, Chapter 8]) to prove that
every compact Lie group admits a bi-invariant Riemannian metric.
Exercise 5.2.22. Prove that all the assertions in Example 5.2.18 carry over
verbatim to any Lie group equipped with a bi-invariant Riemann metric.
Exercise 5.2.23 (Invariant inner product). Prove that, if an inner product on the Lie algebra g of a Lie group G is invariant under conjugation,
then it satisfies the equation
⟨[ξ, η], ζ⟩ = ⟨ξ, [η, ζ]⟩

(5.2.26)

for all ξ, η, ζ ∈ g. If G is connected, prove that, conversely, equation (5.2.26)
implies (5.2.25). An inner product on an arbitrary Lie algebra g is called
invariant iff it satisfies equation (5.2.26).
Exercise 5.2.24 (Commutant). Let g be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra.
The linear subspace spanned by all vectors of the form [ξ, η] is called the
commutant of g and is denoted by [g, g] := span {[ξ, η] | ξ, η ∈ g}. If g
is equipped with an invariant inner product, prove that [g, g]⊥ = Z(g) is
the center of g (Exercise 2.5.34) and hence g = [g, g] ⊕ Z(g). Prove that the
Heisenberg algebra h in Exercise 2.5.15 satisfies [h, h] = Z(h) and hence does
not admit an invariant inner product.
Example 5.2.25 (Killing form). Every finite-dimensional Lie algebra g
admits a natural symmetric bilinear form κ : g × g → R that satisfies equation (5.2.26). It is called the Killing form and is defined by

κ(ξ, η) := trace ad(ξ)ad(η) ,
ξ, η ∈ g,
(5.2.27)
where ad : g → Der(g) is the adjoint representation in Example 2.5.23. The
Killing form may have a kernel (which always contains the center of g), and
even if it is nondegenerate, it may be indefinite.

Exercise 5.2.26. Prove that κ([ξ, η], ζ) = κ(ξ, [η, ζ]) for all ξ, η, ζ ∈ g.
Exercise 5.2.27. Assume that g admits an invariant inner product. For
each ξ ∈ g prove that the derivation ad(ξ) is skew-adjoint with respect to this
inner product and deduce that κ(ξ, ξ) = −trace(ad(ξ)∗ ad(ξ)) = −|ad(ξ)|2 .
Deduce that the Killing form is nondegenerate whenever g has a trivial
center and admits an invariant inner product.
Example 5.2.28 (Right invariant Riemannian metric). Let G be
any Lie subgroup of GL(n, R) (not necessarily contained in O(n)), and
let g := Lie(G) = T1l G be its Lie algebra. Fix any inner product on the
Lie algebra g (not necessarily invariant under conjugation) and consider the
Riemannian metric on G defined by
⟨v, w⟩g := ⟨vg −1 , wg −1 ⟩
for v, w ∈ Tg G. This metric is called right invariant.
(a) The map g 7→ ga is an isometry of G for every a ∈ G.
(b) Define the linear map A : g → End(g) by


⟨A(ξ)η, ζ⟩ =
⟨ξ, [η, ζ]⟩ − ⟨η, [ζ, ξ]⟩ − ⟨ζ, [ξ, η]⟩

A(ξ) + A(ξ)∗ = 0,

(5.2.29)

A(η)ξ − A(ξ)η = [ξ, η]

for all ξ, η ∈ g, where A(ξ)∗ is the adjoint operator with respect to the inner
product on g. Let γ : R → G be a smooth curve and X ∈ Vect(γ) be a
smooth vector field along γ. Then the covariant derivative of X is given by

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

Generalized Theorema Egregium

We will now show that geodesics, covariant differentiation, parallel transport, and the Riemann curvature tensor are all intrinsic, i.e. they are intertwined by isometries. In the extrinsic setting these results are somewhat
surprising since these objects are all defined using the second fundamental
form, whereas isometries need not preserve the second fundamental form in
any sense but only the first fundamental form.
Below we shall give a formula expressing the Gaußian curvature of a
surface M 2 in R3 in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor and the first
fundamental form. It follows that the Gaußian curvature is also intrinsic.
This fact was called by Gauß the “Theorema Egregium” which explains the
title of this section.

5.3.1

Pushforward
′

We assume throughout this section that M ⊂ Rn and M ′ ⊂ Rn are smooth
submanifolds of the same dimension m. As in §5.1 we denote objects on M ′
by the same letters as objects in M with primes affixed. In particular, g ′
denotes the first fundamental form on M ′ and R′ denotes the Riemann
curvature tensor on M ′ .
Let ϕ : M → M ′ be a diffeomorphism. Using ϕ we can move objects
on M to M ′ . For example the pushforward of a smooth curve γ : I → M is
the curve
ϕ∗ γ := ϕ ◦ γ : I → M ′ ,
the pushforward of a smooth function f : M → R is the function
ϕ∗ f := f ◦ ϕ−1 : M ′ → R,
the pushforward of a vector field X ∈ Vect(γ) along a curve γ : I → M is
the vector field ϕ∗ X ∈ Vect(ϕ∗ γ) defined by
(ϕ∗ X)(t) := dϕ(γ(t))X(t)
for t ∈ I, and the pushforward of a global vector field X ∈ Vect(M ) is the
vector field ϕ∗ X ∈ Vect(M ′ ) defined by
(ϕ∗ X)(ϕ(p)) := dϕ(p)X(p)
for p ∈ M . Recall that the first fundamental form on M is the Riemannian
metric g defined as the restriction of the Euclidean inner product on the

5.3. GENERALIZED THEOREMA EGREGIUM

245

ambient space to each tangent space of M . It assigns to each p ∈ M the
bilinear map gp : Tp M × Tp M → R given by
gp (u, v) = ⟨u, v⟩,

u, v ∈ Tp M.

Its pushforward is the Riemannian metric which assigns to each p′ ∈ M ′ the
inner product (ϕ∗ g)p′ : Tp′ M ′ × Tp′ M ′ → R defined by
(ϕ∗ g)ϕ(p) (dϕ(p)u, dϕ(p)v) := gp (u, v)
for p := ϕ−1 (p′ ) ∈ M and u, v ∈ Tp M . The pushforward of the Riemann
curvature tensor is the tensor which assigns to each p′ ∈ M ′ the bilinear
map (ϕ∗ R)p′ : Tp′ M ′ × Tp′ M ′ → L Tp′ M ′ , Tp′ M ′ , defined by
(ϕ∗ R)ϕ(p) (dϕ(p)u, dϕ(p)v) := dϕ(p)Rp (u, v) dϕ(p)−1
for p := ϕ−1 (p′ ) ∈ M and u, v ∈ Tp M .

5.3.2

Theorema Egregium

Theorem 5.3.1 (Theorema Egregium). The first fundamental form, covariant differentiation, geodesics, parallel transport, and the Riemann curvature tensor are intrinsic. This means that for every isometry ϕ : M → M ′
the following holds.
(i) ϕ∗ g = g ′ .
(ii) If X ∈ Vect(γ) is a vector field along a smooth curve γ : I → M , then
∇′ (ϕ∗ X) = ϕ∗ ∇X,

(5.3.1)

and if X, Y ∈ Vect(M ) are global vector fields, then
∇′ϕ∗ X ϕ∗ Y = ϕ∗ (∇X Y ).

(5.3.2)

(iii) If γ : I → M is a geodesic, then ϕ ◦ γ : I → M ′ is a geodesic.
(iv) If γ : I → M is a smooth curve, then for all s, t ∈ I, we have
Φ′ϕ◦γ (t, s)dϕ(γ(s)) = dϕ(γ(t))Φγ (t, s).
(v) ϕ∗ R = R′ .

(5.3.3)

246

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

Proof. Assertion (i) is simply a restatement of Theorem 5.1.1. To prove (ii)
we choose a local smooth parametrization ψ : Ω → U of an open set U ⊂ M ,
defined on an open set Ω ⊂ Rm , so that ψ −1 : U → Ω is a coordinate chart.
Suppose without loss of generality that γ(t) ∈ U for all t ∈ I and define
c : I → Ω and ξ : I → Rm by
γ(t) = ψ(c(t)),

Now consider the same formula for ϕ∗ X using the parametrization
ψ ′ := ϕ ◦ ψ : Ω → U ′ := ϕ(U ) ⊂ M ′ .
The Christoffel symbols Γ′ kij : Ω → R associated to this parametrization of
U ′ are defined by the same formula as the Γkij with ψ replaced by ψ ′ . But
the metric tensor for ψ agrees with the metric tensor for ψ ′ :

∂ψ ∂ψ

Hence it follows from Lemma 3.6.5 that Γ′ kij = Γkij for all i, j, k. This implies

This proves (5.3.1). Equation (5.3.2) follows immediately from (5.3.1) and
Remark 5.2.4.

5.3. GENERALIZED THEOREMA EGREGIUM

247

Here is a second proof of (ii). For every vector field X ∈ Vect(M ) we
define the operator DX : Vect(M ) → Vect(M ) by
DX Y := ϕ∗ (∇ϕ∗ X ϕ∗ Y ) .
Then, for all X, Y ∈ Vect(M ), we have
DY X − DX Y = ϕ∗ (∇ϕ∗ Y ϕ∗ X − ∇ϕ∗ X ϕ∗ Y ) = ϕ∗ [ϕ∗ X, ϕ∗ Y ] = [X, Y ].
Moreover, it follows from (i) that
ϕ∗ LX ⟨Y, Z⟩ = Lϕ∗ X ⟨ϕ∗ Y, ϕ∗ Z⟩
= ⟨∇ϕ∗ X ϕ∗ Y, ϕ∗ Z⟩ + ⟨ϕ∗ Y, ∇ϕ∗ X ϕ∗ Z⟩
= ⟨ϕ∗ DX Y, ϕ∗ Z⟩ + ⟨ϕ∗ Y, ϕ∗ DX Z⟩

= ϕ∗ ⟨DX Y, Z⟩ + ⟨Y, DX Z⟩ .
and hence LX ⟨Y, Z⟩ = ⟨DX Y, Z⟩ + ⟨Y, DX Z⟩ for all X, Y, Z ∈ Vect(M ).
Thus the operator X 7→ DX satisfies equations (5.2.9) and (5.2.10) and, by
Lemma 5.2.7, it follows that DX Y = ∇X Y for all X, Y ∈ Vect(M ). This
completes the second proof of (ii).
We prove (iii). Since ϕ preserves the first fundamental form it also
preserves the energy of curves, namely
E(ϕ ◦ γ) = E(γ)
for every smooth map γ : [0, 1] → M . Hence γ is a critical point of the energy
functional if and only if ϕ ◦ γ is a critical point of the energy functional.
Alternatively it follows from (ii) that


d
′
∇
ϕ ◦ γ = ∇′ ϕ∗ γ̇ = ϕ∗ ∇γ̇
dt
for every smooth curve γ : I → M . If γ is a geodesic, the last term vanishes
and hence ϕ◦γ is a geodesic as well. As a third proof we can deduce (iii) from
the formula ϕ(expp (v)) = expϕ(p) (dϕ(p)v) in the proof of Theorem 5.1.1.
We prove (iv). For t0 ∈ I and v0 ∈ Tγ(t0 ) M define
X(t) := Φγ (t, t0 )v0 ,

X ′ (t) := Φ′ϕ◦γ (t, t0 )dϕ(γ(t0 ))v0 .

By (ii) the vector fields X ′ and ϕ∗ X along ϕ ◦ γ are both parallel and they
agree at t = t0 . Hence X ′ (t) = ϕ∗ X(t) for all t ∈ I and this proves (5.3.3).

248

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

We prove (v). Fix a smooth map γ : R2 → M and a smooth vector
field Z along γ, and define
γ ′ = ϕ ◦ γ : R2 → M ′ ,

Z ′ := ϕ∗ Z ∈ Vect(γ ′ ).

Then it follows from (ii) that
R′ (∂s γ ′ , ∂t γ ′ )Z ′ = ∇′s ∇′t Z ′ − ∇′t ∇′s Z ′
= ϕ∗ (∇s ∇t Z − ∇t ∇s Z)
= dϕ(γ)R(∂s γ, ∂t γ)Z
= (ϕ∗ R)(∂s γ ′ , ∂t γ ′ )Z ′ .
This proves (v) and Theorem 5.3.1.
The assertions of Theorem 5.3.1 carry over in slightly modified form to
local isometries ϕ : M → M ′ . In particular, the pushforward of a vector field
on M under ϕ is only defined when ϕ is a diffeomorphism while the pushforward of a vector field along a curve is defined for any smooth map ϕ. Also,
the pushforward of the Riemann curvature tensor under a local isometry is
only defined locally, and local isometries satisfy the local analogue of the
first assertion in Theorema Egregium by definition.
Corollary 5.3.2 (Theorema Egregium for Local Isometries). Every
local isometry ϕ : M → M ′ has the following properties.
(i) Every vector field X along a smooth curve γ : I → M satisfies (5.3.1).
(ii) If γ : I → M is a geodesic, then so is ϕ ◦ γ : I → M ′ .
(iii) Parallel transport along a smooth curve γ : I → M satisfies (5.3.3).
(iv) The curvature tensors R of M and R′ of M ′ are related by the formula
′
Rϕ(p)
(dϕ(p)u, dϕ(p)v) = dϕ(p)Rp (u, v)dϕ(p)−1

(5.3.4)

for all p ∈ M and all u, v ∈ Tp M .
Proof. Let p0 ∈ M . Then, by the Inverse Function Theorem 2.2.17, there
exists an open neighborhood U ⊂ M of p0 such that U ′ := ϕ(U ) is an open
subset of M ′ and the restriction ϕ|U : U → U ′ is a diffeomorphism. This
restriction is an isometry by Theorem 5.1.1. Hence, by Theorem 5.3.1 the
assertions (i) and (ii) hold for the restriction of γ to I0 := γ −1 (U ) (a union
of subintervals of I) and (iv) holds for all p ∈ U . Since these are local statements and p0 was chosen arbitrary, this proves (i), (ii), and (iv). Part (iii)
follows directly from (i) as in the proof of Theorem 5.3.1 and this proves
Corollary 5.3.2.

5.3. GENERALIZED THEOREMA EGREGIUM

249

The next corollary spells out a useful consequence of Corollary 5.3.2. For
sufficiently small tangent vectors equation (5.3.5) below already appeared
in the proof of Theorem 5.1.1 and was used in Lemma 5.1.10 and Exercise 5.1.11. When M is not complete, recall the notation Vp ⊂ Tp M for
the domain of the exponential map of M at a point p (Definition 4.3.5).
For p′ ∈ M ′ denote the domain of the exponential map by Vp′′ ⊂ Tp′ M ′ .
Corollary 5.3.3. Let ϕ : M → M ′ be a local isometry and let p ∈ M .
′
Then dϕ(p)Vp ⊂ Vϕ(p)
and, for every v ∈ Vp ,
ϕ(expp (v)) = exp′ϕ(p) (dϕ(p)v).

(5.3.5)

Proof. Let v ∈ Vp ⊂ Tp M and define γ(t) := expp (tv) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
Then γ : [0, 1] → M is a geodesic by Lemma 4.3.6, and hence so is the
curve γ ′ := ϕ ◦ γ : [0, 1] → M ′ by Corollary 5.3.2. Moreover,
γ ′ (0) = ϕ(γ(0)) = ϕ(p),

γ̇ ′ (0) = dϕ(γ(0))γ̇(0) = dϕ(p)v

by the chain rule. Hence it follows from the definition of the exponential
′
map (Definition 4.3.5) that dϕ(p)v ∈ Vϕ(p)
and
exp′ϕ(p) (dϕ(p)v) = γ ′ (1) = ϕ(γ(1)) = ϕ(expp (v)).
This proves Corollary 5.3.3.

5.3.3

Gaußian Curvature

As a special case we shall now consider a hypersurface M ⊂ Rm+1 , i.e.
a smooth submanifold of codimension one. We assume that there exists a
smooth map ν : M → Rm+1 such that, for every p ∈ M , we have
ν(p) ⊥ Tp M,

|ν(p)| = 1.

Such a map always exists locally (see Example 3.1.3). Note that ν(p) is
an element of the unit sphere in Rm+1 for every p ∈ M and hence we can
regard ν as a map from M to S m , i.e. ν : M → S m . Such a map is called a
Gauß map for M . Note that if ν : M → S m is a Gauß map, so is −ν, but
this is the only ambiguity when M is connected. Differentiating ν at p ∈ M
we obtain a linear map
dν(p) : Tp M → Tν(p) S m = Tp M
Here we use the fact that Tν(p) S m = ν(p)⊥ and, by definition of the Gauß
map ν, the tangent space of M at p is also equal to ν(p)⊥ . Thus dν(p) is a
linear map from the tangent space of M at p to itself.

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

Definition 5.3.4. The Gaußian curvature of the hypersurface M is the
real valued function K : M → R defined by
K(p) := det dν(p) : Tp M → Tp M



for p ∈ M . (Replacing ν by −ν has the effect of replacing K by (−1)m K;
so K is independent of the choice of the Gauß map when m is even.)
Remark 5.3.5. Given a subset B ⊂ M , the set ν(B) ⊂ S m is often called
the spherical image of B. If ν is a diffeomorphism on a neighborhood
of B, the change of variables formula for an integral gives
Z

Here µM and µS denote the volume elements
on M and S m , respectively.
R
Introducing the notation AreaM (B) := B µM we obtain the formula
|K(p)| = lim

B→p

AreaS (ν(B))
.
AreaM (B)

This says that the curvature at p is roughly the ratio of the (m-dimensional)
area of the spherical image ν(B) to the area of B where B is a very small open
neighborhood of p in M . The sign of K(p) is positive when the linear map
dν(p) : Tp M → Tp M preserves orientation and negative when it reverses
orientation.
Remark 5.3.6. We see that the Gaußian curvature is a natural generalization of Euler’s curvature for a plane curve. Indeed if M ⊂ R2 is a
1-manifold and p ∈ M , we can choose a curve γ = (x, y) : (−ε, ε) → M such
that γ(0) = p and |γ̇(s)| = 1 for every s. This curve parametrizes M by the
arclength and the unit normal vector pointing to the right with respect to
the orientation of γ is ν(x, y) = (ẏ, −ẋ). This is a local Gauß map and its
derivative (ÿ, −ẍ) is tangent to the curve. The inner product of the latter
with the unit tangent vector γ̇ = (ẋ, ẏ) is the Gaußian curvature. Thus
K :=

dx d2 y dy d2 x
dθ
−
=
ds ds2
ds ds2
ds

where s is the arclength parameter and θ is the angle made by the normal
(or the tangent) with some constant line. With this convention K is positive
at a left turn and negative at a right turn.

Exercise 5.3.7. The Gaußian curvature of an m-dimensional sphere of radius r is constant and has the value r−m (with respect to an outward pointing
Gauß map when m is odd).
Exercise 5.3.8. Show that the Gaußian curvature of the surface z = x2 −y 2

Theorem 5.3.9 (Gaußian curvature). Let M ⊂ R3 be a surface and fix

K(p) =

|u|2 |v|2 − ⟨u, v⟩2

Moreover,
R(u, v)w = −K(p)⟨ν(p), u × v⟩ν(p) × w

(5.3.7)

for all u, v, w ∈ Tp M .
Proof. The orthogonal projection of R3 onto the tangent space Tp M = ν(p)⊥
is given by the 3 × 3-matrix
Π(p) = 1l − ν(p)ν(p)T .
Hence

dΠ(p)u = −ν(p)(dν(p)u)T − dν(p)u ν(p)T .
Here the first summand is the second fundamental form, which maps Tp M
to Tp M ⊥ , and the second summand is its dual, which maps Tp M ⊥ to Tp M .
Thus
T
hp (v) = −ν(p) dν(p)v : Tp M → Tp M ⊥ ,

hp (u)∗ = − dν(p)u ν(p)T : Tp M ⊥ → Tp M.

and hence
⟨Rp (u, v)w, z⟩ = ⟨dν(p)u, z⟩⟨dν(p)v, w⟩ − ⟨dν(p)u, w⟩⟨dν(p)v, z⟩.

Now fix four tangent vectors u, v, w, z ∈ Tp M and consider the composition

(5.3.9)

for all p ∈ M and all u, v, w, z ∈ Tp M . This is proved in Theorem 6.4.8
below. Exercise: Deduce this formula from (5.3.7).
Corollary 5.3.11 (Theorema Egregium of Gauß). The Gaußian curvature is intrinsic, i.e. if
ϕ : M → M′
is an isometry of surfaces in R3 , then
K = K ′ ◦ ϕ : M → R.
Proof. Theorem 5.3.1 and Theorem 5.3.9.
Exercise 5.3.12. For m = 1 the Gaußian curvature is clearly not intrinsic
as any two curves are locally isometric (parameterized by arclength). Show
that the curvature K(p) is intrinsic for even m while its absolute value |K(p)|
is intrinsic for odd m ≥ 3. Hint: We still have the equation (5.3.8) which,
for z = u and v = w, can be written in the form

⟨Rp (u, v)v, u⟩ = det

⟨dν(p)u, u⟩ ⟨dν(p)u, v⟩
⟨dν(p)v, u⟩ ⟨dν(p)v, v⟩


.

Thus, for every orthonormal basis v1 , . . . , vm of Tp M , the 2 × 2 minors of
the matrix
(⟨dν(p)vi , vj ⟩)i,j=1,...,m
are intrinsic. Hence everything reduces to the following assertion.
Lemma. The determinant of an m × m matrix is an expression in its 2 × 2
minors if m is even; the absolute value of the determinant is an expression
in the 2 × 2 minors if m is odd and greater than or equal to 3.
The lemma is proved by induction on m. For the absolute value, note the
formula
det(A)m = det(det(A)1lm ) = det(AB) = det(A) det(B)
for an m × m-matrix A where B is the transposed matrix of cofactors.

Gauß
If M ⊂ Rn is a 2-manifold (not necessarily embedded in R3 ), we can use
equation (5.3.6) as the definition of the Gaußian curvature K : M → R.
Let ψ : Ω → U be a local parametrization of an open set U ⊂ M defined on
an open set Ω ⊂ R2 . Denote the coordinates in R2 by (x, y) and define the

CHAPTER 5. CURVATURE

Chapter 6

Geometry and Topology
In this chapter we address what might be called the “fundamental problem
of intrinsic differential geometry”: when are two manifolds isometric? The
central tool for addressing this question is the Cartan–Ambrose–Hicks Theorem (§6.1). In the subsequent sections we will use this result to examine
flat spaces (§6.2), symmetric spaces (§6.3), and constant sectional curvature
manifolds (§6.4). The chapter then examines manifolds of nonpositive sectional curvature and includes a proof of the Cartan Fixed Point Theorem
(§6.5). The last three sections introduce the Ricci tensor and show that
complete manifolds with uniformly positive Ricci tensor are compact (§6.6)
and discuss the scalar curvature (§6.7) and the Weyl tensor (§6.8).

6.1

The Cartan–Ambrose–Hicks Theorem

The Cartan–Ambrose–Hicks Theorem answers the question (at least locally)
when two manifolds are isometric. In general the equivalent conditions given
there are probably more difficult to verify in most examples than the condition that there exist an isometry. However, under additional assumptions
it has many important consequences. The section starts with some basic
observations about homotopy and simple connectivity.

6.1.1

Homotopy

Definition 6.1.1. Let M be a manifold and let I = [a, b] be a compact
interval. A (smooth) homotopy of maps from I to M is a smooth map
γ : [0, 1] × I → M . We often write γλ (t) = γ(λ, t) for λ ∈ [0, 1] and t ∈ I
and call γ a (smooth) homotopy between γ0 and γ1 . We say the
257

258

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

homotopy has fixed endpoints if γλ (a) = γ0 (a) and γλ (b) = γ0 (b) for all
λ ∈ [0, 1]. (See Figure 6.1.)
We remark that a homotopy and a variation are essentially the same
thing, namely a curve of maps (curves). The difference is pedagogical. We
used the word “variation” to describe a curve of maps through a given
map; when we use this word we are going to differentiate the curve to find
a tangent vector (field) to the given map. The word “homotopy” is used
to describe a curve joining two maps; it is a global rather than a local
(infinitesimal) concept.
γ1

M

γ0

Figure 6.1: A homotopy with fixed endpoints.
Definition 6.1.2. A manifold M is called simply connected iff for any
two curves γ0 , γ1 : [a, b] → M with γ0 (a) = γ1 (a) and γ0 (b) = γ1 (b) there exists a homotopy from γ0 to γ1 with endpoints fixed. (The idea is that the
space Ωp,q of curves from p to q is connected.)
Remark 6.1.3. Two smooth maps γ0 , γ1 : [a, b] → M with the same endpoints can be joined by a continuous homotopy if and only if they can be
joined by a smooth homotopy. This follows from the Weierstrass approximation theorem.
Remark 6.1.4. Assume M is a connected smooth manifold. Then the
topological space Ωp,q of all smooth curves in M with the endpoints p and q
is connected for some pair of points p, q ∈ M if and only if it is connected
for every pair of points p, q ∈ M . (Prove this!)
Example 6.1.5. The Euclidean space Rm is simply connected; any two
curves γ0 , γ1 : [a, b] → Rm with the same endpoints can be joined by the
homotopy γλ (t) := γ0 (t) + λ(γ1 (t) − γ0 (t)).
Example 6.1.6. The punctured plane C \ {0} is not simply connected; two
curves of the form
γn (t) := e2πint ,
0 ≤ t ≤ 1,
are not homotopic with fixed endpoints for distinct integers n.
Exercise 6.1.7. Prove that the m-sphere S m is simply connected for m ̸= 1.

Theorem 6.1.8 (Global C-A-H Theorem). Let M ⊂ Rn and M ′ ⊂ Rn
be nonempty, connected, simply connected, complete m-manifolds. Fix two
elements p0 ∈ M and p′0 ∈ M ′ and let Φ0 : Tp0 M → Tp′0 M ′ be an orthogonal
linear isomorphism. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) There exists an isometry ϕ : M → M ′ satisfying
ϕ(p0 ) = p′0 ,

dϕ(p0 ) = Φ0 .

(ii) If (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) is a development satisfying the initial condition
γ ′ (0) = p′0 ,

Φ(0) = Φ0 ,

(6.1.2)

then
γ(1) = p0

γ ′ (1) = p′0 ,

Φ(1) = Φ0

(iii) If (Φ0 , γ0 , γ0′ ) and (Φ1 , γ1 , γ1′ ) are developments satisfying (6.1.2), then
γ0 (1) = γ1 (1)

γ0′ (1) = γ1′ (1).

Example 6.1.9. Before giving the proof let us interpret the conditions in
case M and M ′ are two-dimensional spheres of radius r and r′ respectively in
three-dimensional Euclidean space R3 . Imagine that the spheres are tangent
at p0 = p′0 . Clearly the spheres will be isometric exactly when r = r′ .
Condition (ii) says that if the spheres are rolled along one another without sliding or twisting, then the endpoint γ ′ (1) of one curve of contact
depends only on the endpoint γ(1) of the other and not on the intervening
curve γ(t). This condition is violated in the case r ̸= r′ (see Figure 6.2).

260

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

By Theorem 5.3.9 the Riemann curvature of a 2-manifold at p is determined by the Gaußian curvature K(p); and for spheres we have K(p) = 1/r2 .
Exercise 6.1.10. Let γ be the closed curve which bounds an octant as
shown in the diagram for Example 6.1.9. Find γ ′ .
Exercise 6.1.11. Show that in case M is two-dimensional, the condition
Φ(1) = Φ0 in Theorem 6.1.8 may be dropped from (ii).
Lemma 6.1.12. Let ϕ : M → M ′ be a local isometry and let γ : I → M be
a smooth curve on an interval I. Fix an element t0 ∈ I and define
p0 := γ(t0 ),

q0 := ϕ(p0 ),

Φ0 := dϕ(p0 ).

(6.1.3)

Then there exists a unique development (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) of M along M ′ on the
entire interval I satisfying the initial conditions
γ ′ (t0 ) = q0 ,

Φ(t0 ) = Φ0 .

(6.1.4)

γ ′ (t) = ϕ(γ(t)),

Φ(t) = dϕ(γ(t))

(6.1.5)

γ ′ (t) := ϕ(γ(t)),

Φ(t) := dϕ(γ(t))

This development is given by

for t ∈ I.
Proof. Define
for t ∈ I. Then γ̇ ′ (t) = Φ(t)γ̇(t) for all t ∈ I by the chain rule, and every vector field X along γ satisfies Φ∇X = ∇′ (ΦX) by Corollary 5.3.2.
Hence (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) is a development by Lemma 3.5.19. By (6.1.3) this development satisfies the initial condition (6.1.4). Hence the assertion follows
from the uniqueness result for developments in Theorem 3.5.21. This proves
Lemma 6.1.12.
Proof of Theorem 6.1.8. We first prove a slightly different theorem. Namely,
we weaken condition (i) to assert that ϕ is a local isometry (i.e. not necessarily bijective), and prove that this weaker condition is equivalent to (ii),
(iii), and (iv) whenever M is connected and simply connected and M ′ is
complete. Thus we drop the hypotheses that M be complete and M ′ be
connected and simply connected.
We prove that (i) implies (ii). Given a development as in (ii) we have,
by Lemma 6.1.12,
γ ′ (1) = ϕ(γ(1)) = ϕ(p0 ) = p′0 ,
as required.

Φ(1) = dϕ(γ(1)) = dϕ(p0 ) = Φ0 ,

6.1. THE CARTAN–AMBROSE–HICKS THEOREM

261

We prove that (ii) implies (iii) when M ′ is complete. Choose developments (Φi , γi , γi′ ) for i = 0, 1 as in (iii). Define a curve γ : [0, 1] → M by
“composition”, i.e.

γ0 (2t),
0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2,
γ(t) :=
γ1 (2 − 2t), 1/2 ≤ t ≤ 1,
so that γ is continuous and piecewise smooth and γ(1) = p0 . By Theorem 3.5.21 there exists a development (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) on the interval [0, 1] satisfying (6.1.2) (because M ′ is complete). Since γ(1) = p0 it follows from (ii)
that γ ′ (1) = p′0 and Φ(1) = Φ0 . By the uniqueness of developments and the
invariance under reparametrization, we have

(Φ0 (2t), γ0 (2t), γ0′ (2t)),
0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2,
(Φ(t), γ(t), γ ′ (t)) =
(Φ1 (2 − 2t), γ1 (2 − 2t), γ1′ (2 − 2t)), 1/2 ≤ t ≤ 1.
Hence γ0′ (1) = γ ′ (1/2) = γ1′ (1) as required.
We prove that (iii) implies (i) when M ′ is complete and M is connected.
Define the map ϕ : M → M ′ as follows. Fix an element p ∈ M . Since M is
connected, there exists a smooth curve γ : [0, 1] → M such that γ(0) = p0
and γ(1) = p. Since M ′ is complete, there exists a development (Φ, γ, γ ′ )
with γ ′ (0) = p′0 and Φ(0) = Φ0 (Theorem 3.5.21). Now define ϕ(p) := γ ′ (1).
By (iii) the endpoint p′ := γ ′ (1) is independent of the choice of the curve γ,
and so ϕ is well-defined. We prove that this map ϕ satisfies the following
(a) If (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) is a development satisfying γ(0) = p0 , γ ′ (0) = p′0 , Φ(0) = Φ0 ,
then ϕ(γ(t)) = γ ′ (t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
(b) If p, q ∈ M satisfy 0 < d(p, q) < inj(p; M ) and d(p, q) < inj(ϕ(p); M ′ ),
then d′ (ϕ(p), ϕ(q)) = d(p, q).
That ϕ satisfies (a) follows directly from the definition and the fact that the
triple (Φt , γt , γt′ ) defined by Φt (s) := Φ(st), γt (s) := γ(st), γt′ (s) := γ ′ (st)
for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1 is a development. To prove (b), choose v ∈ Tp M such that
|v| = d(p, q)

expp (v) = q

(Theorem 4.4.4) and let γ : [0, 1] → M be a smooth curve with
γ(0) = p0 ,

γ(t) = expp ((2t − 1)v)

for 21 ≤ t ≤ 1. Let (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) be the unique development of M along M ′
satisfying γ ′ (0) = p′0 and Φ(0) = Φ0 (Theorem 3.5.21). Then, by (a),
γ ′ ( 12 ) = ϕ(p),

γ ′ (1) = ϕ(q).

262

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Also, by part (ii) of Lemma 3.5.19 with X = γ̇, the restriction of γ ′ to the
interval [ 12 , 1] is a geodesic. Thus γ ′ (t) = expϕ(p) ((2t − 1)v ′ ) for 21 ≤ t ≤ 1,
where the tangent vector v ′ ∈ Tϕ(p) M ′ is given by v ′ := γ̇ ′ ( 12 ) = Φ( 12 )v and
hence satisfies |v ′ | = |v| = d(p, q) < inj(ϕ(p), M ′ ). Thus it follows from Theorem 4.4.4 that d′ (ϕ(p), ϕ(q)) = d′ (ϕ(p), exp′ϕ(p) (v ′ )) = |v ′ | = d(p, q) and this
proves (b). It follows from (b) and Theorem 5.1.1 that ϕ is a local isometry.
We prove that (i) implies (iv). Given a development as in (ii) we have
γ ′ (t) = ϕ(γ(t)),

Φ(t) = dϕ(γ(t))

for every t, by Lemma 6.1.12. Hence it follows from part (iv) of Corollary 5.3.2 (Theorema Egregium for local isometries) that
Φ(t)∗ Rγ(t) = (ϕ∗ R)γ ′ (t) = Rγ′ ′ (t)
for all t as required.
We prove that (iv) implies (iii) when M ′ is complete and M is simply
connected. Choose developments (Φi , γi , γi′ ) for i = 0, 1 as in (iii). Since M
is simply connected there exists a homotopy
[0, 1] × [0, 1] → M : (λ, t) 7→ γ(λ, t) = γλ (t)
from γ0 to γ1 with endpoints fixed. By Theorem 3.5.21 there is, for each λ,
a development (Φλ , γλ , γλ′ ) on the interval [0, 1] with initial conditions
γλ′ (0) = p′0 ,

Φλ (0) = Φ0

(because M ′ is complete). The proof of Theorem 3.5.21 also shows that
γλ (t) and Φλ (t) depend smoothly on both t and λ. We must prove that
γ1′ (1) = γ0′ (1).
To see this we will show that, for each fixed t, the curve
λ 7→ (Φλ (t), γλ (t), γλ′ (t))
is a development; then by the definition of development we have that the
curve λ 7→ γλ′ (1) is smooth and
∂λ γλ′ (1) = Φλ (1)∂λ γλ (1) = 0
as required.

6.1. THE CARTAN–AMBROSE–HICKS THEOREM

263

First choose a basis e1 , . . . , em of Tp0 M and extend it to obtain vector
fields Ei ∈ Vect(γ) along the homotopy γ by imposing the conditions that
the vector fields t 7→ Ei (λ, t) be parallel, i.e.
∇t Ei (λ, t) = 0,

Ei (λ, 0) = ei .

(6.1.6)

Then the vectors E1 (λ, t), . . . Em (λ, t) form a basis of Tγλ (t) M for all λ and t.
Second, define the vector fields Ei′ along γ ′ by
Ei′ (λ, t) := Φλ (t)Ei (λ, t)

(6.1.7)

so that ∇′t Ei′ = 0. Third, define the functions ξ 1 , . . . , ξ m : [0, 1]2 → R by
∂t γ =:

Here the last but one equation follows from (iv).

264

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Since the tuples (6.1.9) and (6.1.11) satisfy the same differential equation (6.1.10) and vanish at t = 0 they must agree. Hence
∂λ γ ′ = Φλ ∂λ γ,

∇′λ Ei′ = Φλ ∇λ Ei

for i = 1, . . . , m. This says that λ 7→ (Φλ (t), γλ (t), γλ′ (t)) is a development.
For t = 1 we obtain ∂λ γ ′ (λ, 1) = 0 as required.
Now the modified theorem (where ϕ is a local isometry) is proved. The
original theorem follows immediately. Condition (iv) is symmetric in M
and M ′ . Thus, if we assume (iv), there are local isometries ϕ : M → M ′
and ψ : M ′ → M satisfying ϕ(p0 ) = p′0 , dϕ(p0 ) = Φ0 and ψ(p′0 ) = p0 ,
dψ(p′0 ) = Φ−1
0 . But then ψ ◦ ϕ is a local isometry with ψ ◦ ϕ(p0 ) = p0 and
d(ψ ◦ ϕ)(p0 ) = id. Hence ψ ◦ ϕ is the identity. Similarly ϕ ◦ ψ is the identity
so ϕ is bijective (and ψ = ϕ−1 ) as required. This proves Theorem 6.1.8.
Remark 6.1.13. The proof of Theorem 6.1.8 shows that the various implications in the weak version of the theorem (where ϕ is only a local
isometry) require the following conditions on M and M ′ :
(i) always implies (ii), (iii), and (iv);
(ii) implies (iii) whenever M ′ is complete;
(iii) implies (i) whenever M ′ is complete and M is connected;
(iv) implies (iii) whenever M ′ is complete and M is simply connected.
Remark 6.1.14. The proof that (iii) implies (i) in Theorem 6.1.8 can be
slightly shortened by using the following observation. Let ϕ : M → M ′ be
a map between smooth manifolds. Assume that ϕ ◦ γ is smooth for every
smooth curve γ : [0, 1] → M . Then ϕ is smooth.
Corollary 6.1.15. Let M and M ′ be nonempty, connected, simply connected, complete Riemannian manifolds and let ϕ : M → M ′ be a local
isometry. Then ϕ is bijective and hence is an isometry.
Proof. This follows by combining the weak and strong versions of the global
C-A-H Theorem 6.1.8. Let p0 ∈ M and define p′0 := ϕ(p0 ) and Φ0 := dϕ(p0 ).
Then the tuple M, M ′ , p0 , p′0 , Φ0 satisfies condition (i) of the weak version
of Theorem 6.1.8. Hence this tuple also satisfies condition (iv) of Theorem 6.1.8. Since M and M ′ are connected, simply connected, and complete
we may apply the strong version of Theorem 6.1.8 to obtain an isometry
ψ : M → M ′ satisfying ψ(p0 ) = p′0 and dψ(p0 ) = Φ0 . Since every isometry
is also a local isometry and M is connected it follows from Lemma 5.1.10
that ϕ(p) = ψ(p) for all p ∈ M . Hence ϕ is an isometry, as required.

6.1. THE CARTAN–AMBROSE–HICKS THEOREM

265

Remark 6.1.16. Refining the argument in the proof of Corollary 6.1.15 one
can show that a local isometry ϕ : M → M ′ must be surjective whenever M
is complete and M ′ is connected. None of these assumptions can be removed.
(Take an isometric embedding of a disc in the plane or an embedding of
a complete space M into a space with two components, one of which is
isometric to M .)
Likewise, one can show that a local isometry ϕ : M → M ′ must be
injective whenever M is complete and connected and M ′ is simply connected.
Again none of these asumptions can be removed. (Take a covering R → S 1 ,
or a covering of a disjoint union of two isometric complete simply connected
spaces onto one copy of this space, or some noninjective immersion of a disc
into the plane and choose the pullback metric on the disc.)

6.1.3

The Local C-A-H Theorem

Theorem 6.1.17 (Local C-A-H Theorem). Let M and M ′ be smooth
m-manifolds, let p0 ∈ M and p′0 ∈ M ′ , and let Φ0 : Tp0 M → Tp′0 M ′ be an
orthogonal linear isomorphism. Let r > 0 be smaller than the injectvity radii
of M at p0 and of M ′ at p′0 and define

Ur := {p ∈ M | d(p0 , p) < r} ,
Ur′ := p′ ∈ M ′ | d′ (p′0 , p′ ) < r .
Then the following are equivalent.
(i) There exists an isometry ϕ : Ur → Ur′ satisfying (6.1.1).
(ii) If (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) is a development on an interval I ⊂ R with 0 ∈ I, satisfying
the initial condition (6.1.2) as well as γ(I) ⊂ Ur and γ ′ (I) ⊂ Ur′ , then
γ(1) = p0

γ ′ (1) = p′0 ,

=⇒

Φ(1) = Φ0 .

(iii) If (Φ0 , γ0 , γ0′ ) and (Φ1 , γ1 , γ1′ ) are developments as in (ii), then
γ0 (1) = γ1 (1)

γ0′ (1) = γ1′ (1).

=⇒

(iv) If v ∈ Tp0 M with |v| < r and
γ(t) := expp0 (tv),

γ ′ (t) := exp′p′ (tΦ0 v),

Φ(t) := Φ′γ ′ (t, 0)Φ0 Φγ (0, t),

0

then Φ(t)∗ Rγ(t) = Rγ′ ′ (t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
If these equivalent conditions are satisfied, then
ϕ(expp0 (v)) = exp′p′ (Φ0 v)
0

for all v ∈ Tp0 M with |v| < r.
The proof is based on the following lemma.

266

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Lemma 6.1.18. Let p ∈ M and v, w ∈ Tp M . For 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 define
γ(t) := exp(tv),

X(t) :=

∂
expp t(v + λw) ∈ Tγ(t) M.

Then
∇t ∇t X + R(X, γ̇)γ̇ = 0,

X(0) = 0,

∇t X(0) = w.

(6.1.12)

A vector field along γ satisfying the first equation in (6.1.12) is called a
Jacobi field along γ.
Proof. Define
γ(λ, t) := expp (t(v + λw)),

X(λ, t) := ∂λ γ(λ, t)

for all λ and t. Since γ(λ, 0) = p for all λ we have X(λ, 0) = 0 and
∇t X(λ, 0) = ∇t ∂λ γ(λ, 0) = ∇λ ∂t γ(λ, 0) =


d
v + λw = w.
dλ

Moreover, ∇t ∂t γ = 0 and hence
∇t ∇t X = ∇t ∇t ∂λ γ
= ∇t ∇λ ∂t γ − ∇λ ∇t ∂t γ
= R(∂t γ, ∂λ γ)∂t γ
= R(∂t γ, X)∂t γ.
This proves Lemma 6.1.18.
Proof of Theorem 6.1.17. The proofs (i) =⇒ (ii) =⇒ (iii) =⇒ (i) =⇒ (iv)
are as before; the reader might note that when L(γ) ≤ r we also have
L(γ ′ ) ≤ r for any development so that there are plenty of developments
with γ : [0, 1] → Ur and γ ′ : [0, 1] → Ur′ . The proof that (iv) implies (i) is
a little different since (iv) here is somewhat weaker than (iv) of the global
theorem: the equation Φ∗ R = R′ is only assumed for certain developments.
Hence assume (iv) and define ϕ : Ur → Ur′ by
′
ϕ := exp′p′ ◦Φ0 ◦ exp−1
p0 : Ur → Ur .
0

We must prove that ϕ is an isometry. Thus we fix a point q ∈ Ur and a
tangent vector u ∈ Tq M and choose v, w ∈ Tp M with |v| < r such that
expp0 (v) = q,

d expp0 (v)w = u.

(6.1.13)

6.1. THE CARTAN–AMBROSE–HICKS THEOREM

267

Define γ : [0, 1] → Ur , γ ′ : [0, 1] → Ur′ , X ∈ Vect(γ), and X ′ ∈ Vect(γ ′ ) by
γ(t) = expp0 (tv),
γ ′ (t) = exp′p′ (tΦ0 v),

X(t) :=

Then, by definition of ϕ, we have
γ ′ := ϕ ◦ γ,

dϕ(γ)X = X ′ .

(6.1.14)

By Lemma 6.1.18, X is a solution of (6.1.12) and X ′ is a solution of
∇t ∇t X ′ = R′ (∂t γ ′ , X ′ )∂t γ ′ ,

X ′ (λ, 0) = 0,

∇′t X ′ (λ, 0) = Φ0 w.

(6.1.15)

Now define Φ(t) : Tγ(t) M → Tγ ′ (t) M ′ by
Φ(t) := Φ′γ ′ (t, 0)Φ0 Φγ (0, t).
Then Φ intertwines covariant differentiation. Since γ̇ and γ̇ ′ are parallel
vector fields with γ̇ ′ (0) = Φ0 v = Φ(0)γ̇(0), we have
Φ(t)γ̇(t) = γ̇ ′ (t)
for every t. Moreover, it follows from (iv) that Φ∗ Rγ = Rγ′ ′ . Combining this
with (6.1.12) we obtain
∇′t ∇′t (ΦX) = Φ∇t ∇t X = R′ (Φγ̇, ΦX)Φγ̇ = R′ (γ̇ ′ , ΦX)γ̇ ′ .
Hence the vector field ΦX along γ ′ also satisfies the initial value problem (6.1.15) and thus
ΦX = X ′ = dϕ(γ)X.
Here we have also used (6.1.14). Using (6.1.13) we find
γ(1) = expp0 (v) = q,

X(1) = d expp0 (v)w = u,

and so
dϕ(q)u = dϕ(γ(1))X(1) = X ′ (1) = Φ(1)u.
Since Φ(1) : Tγ(1) M → Tγ ′ (1) M ′ is an orthogonal transformation this gives
|dϕ(q)u| = |Φ(1)u| = |u| .
Hence ϕ is an isometry as claimed. This proves Theorem 6.1.17.

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Flat Spaces

Our aim in the next few sections is to give applications of the CartanAmbrose-Hicks Theorem. It is clear that the hypothesis Φ∗ R = R′ for all
developments will be difficult to verify without drastic hypotheses on the
curvature. The most drastic such hypothesis is that the curvature vanishes
identically.
Definition 6.2.1. A Riemannian manifold M is called flat iff the Riemann
curvature tensor R vanishes identically.
Theorem 6.2.2. Let M ⊂ Rn be a smooth m-manifold.
(i) M is flat if and only if every point has a neighborhood which is isometric
to an open subset of Rm , i.e. at each point p ∈ M there exist local coordinates
x1 , . . . , xm such that the coordinate vectorfields Ei = ∂/∂xi are orthonormal.
(ii) Assume M is connected, simply connected, and complete. Then M is
flat if and only if there is an isometry ϕ : M → Rm onto Euclidean space.
Proof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from Theorem 6.1.17 and (ii) follows immediately from Theorem 6.1.8.
Exercise 6.2.3. Carry over the Cartan–Ambrose–Hicks theorem and Theorem 6.2.2 to the intrinsic setting.
Exercise 6.2.4. A one-dimensional manifold is always flat.
Exercise 6.2.5. If M1 and M2 are flat, so is M = M1 × M2 .
Example 6.2.6. By Exercises 6.2.4 and 6.2.5 the standard torus

Tm = z = (z1 , . . . , zm ) ∈ Cm |z1 | = · · · = |zm | = 1
is flat.
Exercise 6.2.7. For a, b > 0 and c ≥ 0 define M ⊂ C3 by
n
u vo
.
M := M (a, b, c) := (u, v, w) ∈ C3 |u| = a, |v| = b, w = c
ab
Then M is diffeomorphic to a torus (a product of two circles) and M is flat. If
a′ , b′ > 0 and c′ ≥ 0, prove that there is an isometry ϕ from M ′ = M (a′ , b′ , c′ )
to M = M (a, b, c) if and only if the triples (a′ , b′ , c′ ) and (a, b, c) are related
by a permutation.

Exercise 6.2.8 (Developable manifolds). Let n = m + 1 and let E(t) be
a one-parameter family of hyperplanes in Rn . Then there exists a smooth
map u : R → Rn such that
E(t) = u(t)⊥ ,

|u(t)| = 1,

(6.2.1)

for every t. We assume that u̇(t) ̸= 0 for every t so that u(t) and u̇(t) are
linearly independent. Show that
L(t) := u(t)⊥ ∩ u̇(t)⊥ = lim E(t) ∩ E(s).
s→t

(6.2.2)

Thus L(t) is a linear subspace of dimension m − 1. Now let γ : R → Rn be
a smooth curve such that
⟨γ̇(t), u(t)⟩ = 0,

⟨γ̇(t), u̇(t)⟩ =
̸ 0

(6.2.3)

for all t. This means that γ̇(t) ∈ E(t) and γ̇(t) ∈
/ L(t); thus E(t) is spanned
by L(t) and γ̇(t). For t ∈ R and ε > 0 define
L(t)ε := {v ∈ L(t) | |v| < ε} .
Let I ⊂ R be a bounded open interval such that the restriction of γ to the
closure of I is injective. Prove that, for ε > 0 sufficiently small, the set

[
M0 :=
γ(t) + L(t)ε
t∈I

is a smooth manifold of dimension m = n − 1. A manifold which arises this
way is called developable. Show that the tangent spaces of M0 are the
original subspaces E(t), i.e.
Tp M0 = E(t)

for

p ∈ γ(t) + L(t)ε .

270

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

(One therefore calls M0 the “envelope” of the hyperplanes γ(t) + E(t).)
Show that M0 is flat. (Hint: use Gauß–Codazzi.) If (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) is a development of M0 along Rm , show that the map ϕ : M0 → Rm , defined
by
ϕ(γ(t) + v) := γ ′ (t) + Φ(t)v
for v ∈ L(t)ε , is an isometry onto an open set M0′ ⊂ Rm . Thus a development
“unrolls” M0 onto the Euclidean space Rm . When n = 3 and m = 2 one
can visualize M0 as a twisted sheet of paper (see Figure 6.3).

Figure 6.3: Developable surfaces.
Remark 6.2.9. Given a codimension-1 submanifold
M ⊂ Rm+1
and a curve γ : R → M we may form the osculating developable M0 to M
along γ by taking
E(t) := Tγ(t) M.
This developable has common affine tangent spaces with M along γ as
Tγ(t) M0 = E(t) = Tγ(t) M
for every t. This gives a nice interpretation of parallel transport: M0 may be
unrolled onto a hyperplane where parallel transport has an obvious meaning
and the identification of the tangent spaces thereby defines parallel transport
in M . (See Remark 3.5.16.)
Exercise 6.2.10. Each of the following is a developable surface in R3 .
(i) A cone on a plane curve Γ ⊂ H, i.e.
M = {tp + (1 − t)q | t > 0, q ∈ Γ}
where H ⊂ R3 is an affine hyperplane, p ∈ R3 \H, and Γ ⊂ H is a 1-manifold.

6.2. FLAT SPACES

271

(ii) A cylinder on a plane curve Γ, i.e.
M = {q + tv | q ∈ Γ, t ∈ R}
where H and Γ are as in (i) and v is a fixed vector not parallel to H. (This
is a cone with the cone point p at infinity.)
(iii) The tangent developable to a space curve γ : R → R3 , i.e.
M = {γ(t) + sγ̇(t) | |t − t0 | < ε, 0 < s < ε} ,
where γ̇(t0 ) and γ̈(t0 ) are linearly independent and ε > 0 is sufficiently small.
(iv) The paper model of a Möbius strip (see Figure 6.3).

Figure 6.4: A circular one-sheeted hyperboloid.
Remark 6.2.11. A 2-dimensional submanifold M ⊂ R3 is called a ruled
surface iff there is a straight line in M through every point. Every developable surface is ruled, however, there are ruled surfaces that are not developable. An example is the manifold M = {γ(t) + sγ̈(t) | |t − t0 | < ε, |s| < ε}
where γ : R → R3 is a smooth curve with |γ̇| ≡ 1 and γ̈(t0 ) ̸= 0, and ε > 0 is
sufficiently small; this surface is not developable in general. Other examples
are the elliptic hyperboloid of one sheet

These five surfaces have negative Gaußian curvature. The Möbius strip

The helicoid in (6.2.7) is a minimal surface, i.e. its mean curvature (the
trace of the second fundamental form) vanishes. A minimal surface which
is not ruled is the catenoid
M := {(x, y, z) ∈ R3 | x2 + y 2 = c2 cosh (z/c)}.
(Exercise: Prove all this.)

6.3

Symmetric Spaces

In the last section we applied the Cartan-Ambrose-Hicks Theorem in the flat
case; the hypothesis Φ∗ R = R′ was easy to verify since both sides vanish. To
find more general situations where we can verify this hypothesis note that
for any development (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) satisfying the initial conditions
γ(0) = p0 ,

γ ′ (0) = p′0 ,

Φ(0) = Φ0 ,

we have
Φ(t) = Φ′γ ′ (t, 0)Φ0 Φγ (0, t)
so that the hypothesis Φ∗ R = R′ is certainly implied by the three hypotheses
Φγ (t, 0)∗ Rp0 = Rγ(t)
Φ′γ ′ (t, 0)∗ Rp′ ′ = Rγ′ ′ (t)
0

(Φ0 )∗ Rp0 = Rp′ ′ .
0

The last hypothesis is a condition on the initial linear isomorphism
Φ0 : Tp0 M → Tp′0 M ′
while the former hypotheses are conditions on M and M ′ respectively,
namely, that the Riemann curvature tensor is invariant by parallel transport. It is rather amazing that this condition is equivalent to a simple
geometric condition as we now show.

satisfying (6.3.1); M is called a locally symmetric space iff it is locally
symmetric about each of its points.
Remark 6.3.2. The proof of Theorem 6.3.4 below will show that, if M is
locally symmetric, the isometry ϕ : Ur (p, M ) → Ur (p, M ) with ϕ(p) = p
and dϕ(p) = −id exists whenever 0 < r ≤ inj(p).
Exercise 6.3.3. Every symmetric space is complete. Hint: If γ : I → M is
a geodesic and ϕ : M → M is a symmetry about the point γ(t0 ) for t0 ∈ I,
then ϕ(γ(t0 + t)) = γ(t0 − t) for all t ∈ R with t0 + t, t0 − t ∈ I.
Theorem 6.3.4. Let M ⊂ Rn be an m-dimensional submanifold. Then the
following are equivalent.
(i) M is locally symmetric.
(ii) The covariant derivative ∇R (defined below) vanishes identically, i.e.
(∇v R)p (v1 , v2 )w = 0
for all p ∈ M and v, v1 , v2 , w ∈ Tp M .
(iii) The curvature tensor R is invariant under parallel transport, i.e.
Φγ (t, s)∗ Rγ(s) = Rγ(t)
for every smooth curve γ : R → M and all s, t ∈ R.
Proof. See §6.3.2.

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Corollary 6.3.5. Let M and M ′ be locally symmetric spaces and fix two
points p0 ∈ M and p′0 ∈ M ′ , and let Φ0 : Tp0 M → Tp′0 M ′ be an orthogonal
linear isomorphism. Let r > 0 be less than the injectivity radius of M at p0
and the injectivity radius of M ′ at p′0 . Then the following holds.
(i) There exists an isometry ϕ : Ur (p0 , M ) → Ur (p′0 , M ′ ) with ϕ(p0 ) = p′0
and dϕ(p0 ) = Φ0 if and only if Φ0 intertwines R and R′ , i.e.
(Φ0 )∗ Rp0 = Rp′ ′ .
0

(6.3.3)

(ii) Assume M and M ′ are connected, simply connected, and complete.
Then there exists an isometry ϕ : M → M ′ with ϕ(p0 ) = p′0 and dϕ(p0 ) = Φ0
if and only if Φ0 satisfies (6.3.3).
Proof. In (i) and (ii) the “only if” statement follows from Theorem 5.3.1
(Theorema Egregium) with Φ0 := dϕ(p0 ). To prove the “if” statement, let
(Φ, γ, γ ′ ) be a development satisfying γ(0) = p0 , γ ′ (0) = p′0 , and Φ(0) = Φ0 .
Since R and R′ are invariant under parallel transport, by Theorem 6.3.4, it
follows from the discussion in the beginning of this section that Φ∗ R = R′ .
Hence assertion (i) follows from the local C-A-H Theorem 6.1.17 and (ii)
follows from the global C-A-H Theorem 6.1.8.
Corollary 6.3.6. A connected, simply connected, complete, locally symmetric space is symmetric.
Proof. Corollary 6.3.5 (ii) with M ′ = M , p′0 = p0 , and Φ0 = −id.
Corollary 6.3.7. A connected symmetric space M is homogeneous; i.e.
given p, q ∈ M there exists an isometry ϕ : M → M with ϕ(p) = q.
Proof. If M is simply connected, the assertion follows from part (ii) of Corollary 6.3.5 with M = M ′ , p0 = p, p′0 = q, and Φ0 = Φγ (1, 0) : Tp M → Tq M ,
where γ : [0, 1] → M is a curve from p to q. If M is not simply connected,
we can argue as follows. There is an equivalence relation on M defined by
p∼q

: ⇐⇒

∃ isometry ϕ : M → M ∋ ϕ(p) = q.

Let p, q ∈ M and suppose that d(p, q) < inj(p). By Theorem 4.4.4 there
is a unique shortest geodesic γ : [0, 1] → M connecting p to q. Since M is
symmetric there is an isometry ϕ : M → M such that ϕ(γ(1/2)) = γ(1/2)
and dϕ(γ(1/2)) = −id. This isometry satisfies ϕ(γ(t)) = γ(1 − t) and hence
ϕ(p) = q. Thus p ∼ q whenever d(p, q) < inj(p). This shows that each
equivalence class is open, hence each equivalence class is also closed, and
hence there is only one equivalence class because M is connected. This
proves Corollary 6.3.7.

Covariant Derivative of the Curvature

For two vector spaces V, W and an integer k ≥ 1 we denote by Lk (V, W )
the vector space of all multi-linear maps from V k = V × · · · × V to W .
Thus L1 (V, W ) = L(V, W ) is the space of all linear maps from V to W .
Definition 6.3.8. The covariant derivative of the Riemann curvature
tensor assigns to every p ∈ M a linear map
(∇R)p : Tp M → L2 (Tp M, L(Tp M, Tp M ))
such that

(∇R)(X)(X1 , X2 )Y = ∇X R(X1 , X2 )Y − R(∇X X1 , X2 )Y
− R(X1 , ∇X X2 )Y − R(X1 , X2 )∇X Y

(6.3.4)

for all X, X1 , X2 , Y ∈ Vect(M ). We also use the notation
(∇v R)p := (∇R)p (v)
for p ∈ M and v ∈ Tp M so that
(∇X R)(X1 , X2 )Y := (∇R)(X)(X1 , X2 )Y
for all X, X1 , X2 , Y ∈ Vect(M ).
Remark 6.3.9. One verifies easily that the map
Vect(M )4 → Vect(M ) : (X, X1 , X2 , Y ) 7→ (∇X R)(X1 , X2 )Y,
defined by the right hand side of equation (6.3.4), is multi-linear over the
ring of functions F (M ). Hence it follows as in Remark 5.2.13 that ∇R is
well defined, i.e. that the right hand side of (6.3.4) at p ∈ M depends only
on the tangent vectors X(p), X1 (p), X2 (p), Y (p).
Remark 6.3.10. Let γ : I → M be a smooth curve on an interval I ⊂ R
and
X1 , X2 , Y ∈ Vect(γ)
be smooth vector fields along γ. Then equation (6.3.4) continues to hold
with X replaced by γ̇ and each ∇X on the right hand side replaced by the
covariant derivative of the respective vector field along γ:
(∇γ̇ R)(X1 , X2 )Y = ∇(R(X1 , X2 )Y ) − R(∇X1 , X2 )Y
− R(X1 , ∇X2 )Y − R(X1 , X2 )∇Y.

(6.3.6)

(ii) The covariant derivative of the Riemann curvature tensor satisfies the
second Bianchi identity
(∇X R)(Y, Z) + (∇Y R)(Z, X) + (∇Z R)(X, Y ) = 0.

(6.3.7)

Proof. We prove (i). Let v1 , v2 , w ∈ Tp M and choose parallel vector fields
X1 , X2 , Y ∈ Vect(γ) along γ satisfying the initial conditions X1 (0) = v1 ,
X2 (0) = v2 , Y (0) = w. Thus
X1 (t) = Φγ (t, 0)v1 ,

X2 (t) = Φγ (t, 0)v2 ,

Y (t) = Φγ (t, 0)w.

Then the last three terms on the right vanish in equation (6.3.5) and hence
(∇v R)(v1 , v2 )w = ∇(R(X1 , X2 )Y )(0)

Here the second equation follows from Theorem 3.3.6. This proves (i).
We prove (ii). Choose a smooth function γ : R3 → M and denote by
(r, s, t) the coordinates on R3 . If Y is a vector field along γ, we have

(∇∂r γ R)(∂s γ, ∂t γ)Y = ∇r R(∂s γ, ∂t γ)Y − R(∂s γ, ∂t γ)∇r Y
− R(∇r ∂s γ, ∂t γ)Y − R(∂s γ, ∇r ∂t γ)Y
= ∇r (∇s ∇t Y − ∇t ∇s Y ) − (∇s ∇t − ∇t ∇s ) ∇r Y
+ R(∂t γ, ∇r ∂s γ)Y − R(∂s γ, ∇t ∂r γ)Y.
Permuting the variables r, s, t cyclically and taking the sum of the resulting
three equations we obtain
(∇∂r γ R)(∂s γ, ∂t γ)Y + (∇∂s γ R)(∂t γ, ∂r γ)Y + (∇∂t γ R)(∂r γ, ∂s γ)Y
= ∇r (∇s ∇t Y − ∇t ∇s Y ) − (∇s ∇t − ∇t ∇s ) ∇r Y
+ ∇s (∇t ∇r Y − ∇r ∇t Y ) − (∇t ∇r − ∇r ∇t ) ∇s Y
+ ∇t (∇r ∇s Y − ∇s ∇r Y ) − (∇r ∇s − ∇s ∇r ) ∇t Y.
The terms on the right cancel out. This proves Theorem 6.3.11.

6.3. SYMMETRIC SPACES

277

Proof of Theorem 6.3.4. We prove that (iii) implies (i). This follows from
the local Cartan–Ambrose–Hicks Theorem 6.1.17 with
p′0 = p0 = p,

Φ0 = −id : Tp M → Tp M.

This isomorphism satisfies
(Φ0 )∗ Rp = Rp .
Hence it follows from the discussion in the beginning of this section that
Φ∗ R = R ′
for every development (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) of M along itself satisfying
γ(0) = γ ′ (0) = p,

Φ(0) = −id.

Hence, by the local C-A-H Theorem 6.1.17, there is an isometry
ϕ : Ur (p, M ) → Ur (p, M )
satisfying
ϕ(p) = p,

dϕ(p) = −id

whenever 0 < r < inj(p; M ).
We prove that (i) implies (ii). By Theorem 5.3.1 (Theorema Egregium),
every isometry ϕ : M → M ′ preserves the Riemann curvature tensor and
covariant differentiation, and hence also the covariant derivative of the Riemann curvature tensor, i.e.
ϕ∗ (∇R) = ∇′ R′ .
Applying this to the local isometry ϕ : Ur (p, M ) → Ur (p, M ) we obtain

∇dϕ(p)v R ϕ(p) (dϕ(p)v1 , dϕ(p)v2 ) = dϕ(p) (∇v R) (v1 , v2 )dϕ(p)−1
for all v, v1 , v2 ∈ Tp M . Since
dϕ(p) = −id
this shows that ∇R vanishes at p.
We prove that (ii) imlies (iii). If ∇R vanishes, then equation (6.3.6) in
Theorem 6.3.11 shows that the function
s 7→ Φγ (t, s)∗ Rγ(s) = Φγ (t, 0)∗ Φγ (0, s)∗ Rγ(s)
is constant and hence is everywhere equal to Rγ(t) . This implies (6.3.2) and
completes the proof of Theorem 6.3.4.

Examples and Exercises

Example 6.3.12. Every flat manifold is locally symmetric.
Example 6.3.13. If M1 and M2 are (locally) symmetric, so is M1 × M2 .

6.3. SYMMETRIC SPACES

Example 6.3.14. M = Rm with the standard metric is a symmetric space.
Recall that the isometry group I(Rm ) consists of all affine transformations
of the form
ϕ(x) = Ax + b,
A ∈ O(m),
b ∈ Rm .
(See Exercise 5.1.4.) The isometry with fixed point p ∈ Rm and dϕ(p) = −id
is given by ϕ(x) = 2p − x for x ∈ Rm .
Example 6.3.15. The flat tori of Exercise 6.2.7 in the previous section are
symmetric (but not simply connected). This shows that the hypothesis of
simple connectivity cannot be dropped in part (ii) of Corollary 6.3.5.
Example 6.3.16. Below we define manifolds of constant curvature and
show that they are locally symmetric.
The simplest example, after a flat

space, is the unit sphere S m = x ∈ Rm+1 | |x| = 1 . The symmetry ϕ of
the sphere about a point p ∈ M is given by
ϕ(x) := −x + 2⟨p, x⟩p
for x ∈ S m . This extends to an orthogonal linear transformation of the
ambient space. In fact the group of isometries of S m is the group O(m + 1)
of orthogonal linear transformations of Rm+1 (see Example 6.4.16 below).
In accordance with Corollary 6.3.7 this group acts transitively on S m .
Example 6.3.17. A compact two-dimensional manifold of constant negative curvature is locally symmetric (as its universal cover is symmetric)
but not homogeneous (as closed geodesics of a given period are isolated).
Hence it is not symmetric. This shows that the hypothesis that M be simply
connected cannot be dropped in Corollary 6.3.6.
Example 6.3.18. The real projective space RPn with the metric inherited
from S n is a symmetric space and the orthogonal group O(n+1) acts on it by
isometries. The complex projective space CPn with the Fubini–Study metric
in Example 3.7.5 is a symmetric space and the unitary group U(n + 1) acts
on it by isometries. The complex Grassmannian Gk (Cn ) in Example 3.7.6
is a symmetric space and the unitary group U(n) acts on it by isometries.
(Exercise: Prove this.)
Example 6.3.19. The simplest example of a symmetric
 space which is not
of constant curvature is the orthogonal group O(n) = g ∈ Rn×n | g T g = 1l
with the Riemannian metric (5.2.20) of Example 5.2.18. The symmetry ϕ
about the point a ∈ O(n) is given by ϕ(g) = ag −1 a. This discussion extends
to every Lie subgroup G ⊂ O(n). (Exercise: Prove this.)

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Constant Curvature

In the §5.3 we saw that the Gaußian curvature of a two-dimensional surface
is intrinsic: we gave a formula for it in terms of the Riemann curvature
tensor and the first fundamental form. We may use this formula to define the
Gaußian curvature for any two-dimensional manifold (even if its codimension
is greater than one). We make a slightly more general definition.

6.4.1

Sectional Curvature

Definition 6.4.1. Let M ⊂ Rn be a smooth m-dimensional submanifold.
Let p ∈ M and let E ⊂ Tp M be a 2-dimensional linear subspace of the tangent space. The sectional curvature of M at (p, E) is the number
K(p, E) =

⟨Rp (u, v)v, u⟩
,
|u|2 |v|2 − ⟨u, v⟩2

(6.4.1)

where u, v ∈ E are linearly independent (and hence form a basis of E).
The right hand side of (6.4.1) remains unchanged if we multiply u or v
by a nonzero real number or add to one of the vectors a real multiple of the
other; hence it depends only on the linear subspace spanned by u ad v.
Example 6.4.2. If M ⊂ R3 is a 2-manifold, then by Theorem 5.3.9 the
sectional curvature K(p, Tp M ) = K(p) is the Gaußian curvature of M at p.
More generally, for any 2-manifold M ⊂ Rn (whether or not it has codimension one) we define the Gaußian curvature of M at p by
K(p) := K(p, Tp M ).

(6.4.2)

Example 6.4.3. If M ⊂ Rm+1 is a submanifold of codimension one and
ν : M → S m is a Gauß map, then the sectional curvature of a 2-dimensional
subspace E ⊂ Tp M spanned by two linearly independent tangent vectors
u, v ∈ Tp M is given by
K(p, E) =

⟨u, dν(p)u⟩⟨v, dν(p)v⟩ − ⟨u, dν(p)v⟩2
.
|u|2 |v|2 − ⟨u, v⟩2

(6.4.3)

This follows from equation (5.3.8) in the proof of Theorem 5.3.9 which holds
in all dimensions. In particular, when M = S m , we have ν(p) = p and hence
K(p, E) = 1 for all p and E. For a sphere of radius r we have ν(p) = p/r
and hence K(p, E) = 1/r2 .

6.4. CONSTANT CURVATURE

281

Example 6.4.4. Let G ⊂ O(n) be a Lie subgroup equipped with the Riemannian metric
⟨v, w⟩ := trace(v T w)
for v, w ∈ Tg G ⊂ Rn×n . Then, by Example 5.2.18, the sectional curvature
of G at the identity matrix 1l is given by
1
|[ξ, η]|2
4
for every 2-dimensional linear subspace E ⊂ g = Lie(G) = T1l G with an
orthonormal basis ξ, η.
K(1l, E) =

Exercise 6.4.5. Let E ⊂ Tp M be a 2-dimensional linear subspace, let r > 0
be smaller than the injectivity radius of M at p, and let N ⊂ M be the 2dimensional submanifold given by
N := expp ({v ∈ E | |v| < r}) .
Show that the sectional curvature K(p, E) of M at (p, E) agrees with the
Gaußian curvature of N at p.
Exercise 6.4.6. Let p ∈ M ⊂ Rn and let E ⊂ Tp M be a 2-dimensional linear subspace. For r > 0 let L denote the ball of radius r in the (n − m + 2)dimensional affine subspace of Rn through p and parallel to the vector subspace E + Tp M ⊥ :
o
n
L = p + v + w | v ∈ E, w ∈ Tp M ⊥ , |v|2 + |w|2 < r2 .
Show that, for r sufficiently small, L ∩ M is a 2-dimensional manifold with
Gaußian curvature KL∩M (p) at p given by KL∩M (p) = K(p, E).

6.4.2

Constant Sectional Curvature

Definition 6.4.7. Let k ∈ R and m ≥ 2 be an integer. An m-manifold
M ⊂ Rn is said to have constant sectional curvature k iff K(p, E) = k
for every p ∈ M and every 2-dimensional linear subspace E ⊂ Tp M .
Theorem 6.4.8. Let M ⊂ Rn be an m-manifold and fix an element p ∈ M
and a real number k. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) K(p, E) = k for every 2-dimensional linear subspace E ⊂ Tp M .
(ii) The Riemann curvature tensor of M at p is given by


⟨Rp (v1 , v2 )v3 , v4 ⟩ = k ⟨v1 , v4 ⟩⟨v2 , v3 ⟩ − ⟨v1 , v3 ⟩⟨v2 , v4 ⟩
(6.4.4)
for all v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ∈ Tp M .

282

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Proof. That (ii) implies (i) follows directly from the definition of the sectional curvature in (6.4.1) by taking v1 = v4 = u and v2 = v3 = v in (6.4.4).
Conversely, assume (i) and define the multi-linear map Q : Tp M 4 → R by


Q(v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ) := ⟨Rp (v1 , v2 )v3 , v4 ⟩ − k ⟨v1 , v4 ⟩⟨v2 , v3 ⟩ − ⟨v1 , v3 ⟩⟨v2 , v4 ⟩ .
Then, for all u, v, v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ∈ Tp M , the map Q satisfies the equations
Q(v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ) + Q(v2 , v1 , v3 , v4 ) = 0,
Q(v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ) + Q(v2 , v3 , v1 , v4 ) + Q(v3 , v1 , v2 , v4 ) = 0,

(6.4.5)
(6.4.6)

Q(v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ) − Q(v3 , v4 , v1 , v2 ) = 0,

(6.4.7)

Q(u, v, u, v) = 0.

(6.4.8)

Here the first three equations follow from Theorem 5.2.14 and the last follows
from the definition of Q and the hypothesis that the sectional curvature
is K(p, E) = k for every 2-dimensional linear subspace E ⊂ Tp M .
We must prove that Q vanishes. Using (6.4.7) and (6.4.8) we find
0 = Q(u, v1 + v2 , u, v1 + v2 )
= Q(u, v1 , u, v2 ) + Q(u, v2 , u, v1 )
= 2Q(u, v1 , u, v2 )
for all u, v1 , v2 ∈ Tp M . This implies
0 = Q(u1 + u2 , v1 , u1 + u2 , v2 )
= Q(u1 , v1 , u2 , v2 ) + Q(u2 , v1 , u1 , v2 )
for all u1 , u2 , v1 , v2 ∈ Tp M . Hence
Q(v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ) = −Q(v3 , v2 , v1 , v4 )
= Q(v2 , v3 , v1 , v4 )
= −Q(v3 , v1 , v2 , v4 ) − Q(v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ).
Here the second equation follows from (6.4.5) and the last from (6.4.6). Thus
1
1
Q(v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ) = − Q(v3 , v1 , v2 , v4 ) = Q(v1 , v3 , v2 , v4 )
2
2
for all v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ∈ Tp M and, repeating this argument,
1
Q(v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ) = Q(v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ).
4
Hence Q ≡ 0 as claimed. This proves Theorem 6.4.8.

6.4. CONSTANT CURVATURE

283

Remark 6.4.9. The symmetric group S4 on four symbols acts naturally
on the space L4 (Tp M, R) of multi-linear maps from Tp M 4 to R. The conditions (6.4.5), (6.4.6), (6.4.7), and (6.4.8) say that the four elements
a = id + (12),
c = id + (123) + (132),
b = id − (34),
d = id + (13) + (24) + (13)(24)
of the group ring of S4 annihilate Q. This suggests an alternate proof of
Theorem 6.4.8. A representation of a finite group is completely reducible
so one can prove that Q = 0 by showing that any vector in any irreducible
representation of S4 which is annihilated by the four elements a, b, c and
d must necessarily be zero. This can be checked case by case for each
irreducible representation. (The group S4 has 5 irreducible representations:
two of dimension 1, two of dimension 3, and one of dimension 2.)
If M and M ′ are two m-dimensional manifolds with constant curvature k,
then every orthogonal isomorphism Φ : Tp M → Tp′ M ′ intertwines the Riemann curvature tensors by Theorem 6.4.8. Hence by the appropriate version
(local or global) of the C-A-H Theorem we have the following corollaries.
Corollary 6.4.10. Every Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature is locally symmetric.
Proof. Theorem 6.3.4 and Theorem 6.4.8.
Corollary 6.4.11. Let M and M ′ be m-dimensional Riemannian manifolds
with constant curvature k and let p ∈ M and p′ ∈ M ′ . If r > 0 is smaller
than the injectivity radii of M at p and of M ′ at p′ , then for every orthogonal
isomorphism
Φ : Tp M → Tp′ M ′
there exists an isometry
ϕ : Ur (p, M ) → Ur (p′ , M ′ )
such that
ϕ(p) = p′ ,

dϕ(p) = Φ.

Proof. This follows from Corollary 6.3.5 and Corollary 6.4.10. Alternatively
one can use Theorem 6.4.8 and the local C-A-H Theorem 6.1.17.

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Corollary 6.4.12. Any two connected, simply connected, complete Riemannian manifolds with the same constant sectional curvature and the same
dimension are isometric.
Proof. Theorem 6.4.8 and the global C-A-H Theorem 6.1.8.
Corollary 6.4.13. Let M ⊂ Rn be a connected, simply connected, complete
manifold. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) M has constant sectional curvature.
(ii) For every pair of points p, q ∈ M and every orthogonal linear isomorphism Φ : Tp M → Tq M there exists an isometry ϕ : M → M such that
ϕ(p) = q,

dϕ(p) = Φ.

Proof. That (i) implies (ii) follows immediately from Theorem 6.4.8 and the
global C-A-H Theorem 6.1.8. Conversely assume (ii). Then, for every pair
of points p, q ∈ M and every orthogonal linear isomorphism
Φ : Tp M → Tq M,
it follows from Theorem 5.3.1 (Theorema Egregium) that
Φ∗ Rp = Rq
and so
K(p, E) = K(q, ΦE)
for every 2-dimensional linear subspace E ⊂ Tp M . Since, for every pair of
points p, q ∈ M and of 2-dimensional linear subspaces
E ⊂ Tp M,

F ⊂ Tq M,

we can find an orthogonal linear isomorphism Φ : Tp M → Tq M such that
ΦE = F,
this implies (i).
Corollary 6.4.13 asserts that a connected, simply connected, complete
Riemannian m-manifold M has constant sectional curvature if and only if
the isometry group I(M ) acts transitively on its orthonormal frame bundle O(M ). Note that, by Lemma 5.1.10, this group action is also free.

Examples and Exercises
Example 6.4.14. Any flat Riemannian manifold has constant sectional
curvature k = 0.
Example 6.4.15. The manifold
M = Rm
with its standard metric is, up to isometry, the unique connected, simply
connected, complete Riemannian m-manifold with constant sectional curvature
k = 0.
Example 6.4.16. For m ≥ 2 the unit sphere
M = Sm
with its standard metric is, up to isometry, the unique connected, simply
connected, complete Riemannian m-manifold with constant sectional curvature
k = 1.
Hence, by Corollary 6.4.12, every connected simply connected, complete
Riemannian manifold with positive sectional curvature k = 1 is compact.
Moreover, by Corollary 6.4.13, the isometry group I(S m ) is isomorphic to
the group O(m + 1) of orthogonal linear transformations of Rm+1 . Thus,
by Corollary 6.4.13, the orthonormal frame bundle O(S m ) is diffeomorphic
to O(m + 1). This follows also from the fact that, if
v1 , . . . , v m
is an orthonormal basis of Tp S m = p⊥ then
p, v1 , . . . , vm
is an orthonormal basis of Rm+1 .
Example 6.4.17. A product of spheres is not a space of constant sectional
curvature, but it is a symmetric space. Exercise: Prove this.
Example 6.4.18. For n ≥ 4 the orthogonal group O(n) is not a space of
constant sectional curvature, but it is a symmetric space and has nonnegative
sectional curvature (see Example 6.4.4).

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Hyperbolic Space

Fix an integer m ≥ 2. The hyperbolic space Hm is, up to isometry, the
unique connected, simply connected, complete Riemannian m-manifold with
constant sectional curvature
k = −1.
A model for Hm can be constructed as follows. A point in Rm+1 will be
denoted by
p = (x0 , x),

x0 ∈ R,

x = (x1 , . . . , xm ) ∈ Rm .

Let Q : Rm+1 × Rm+1 → R denote the symmetric bilinear form given by
Q(p, q) := −x0 y0 + x1 y1 + · · · + xm ym

(6.4.9)

for p = (x0 , x), q = (y0 , y) ∈ Rm+1 . Since Q is nondegenerate the space

Hm := p = (x0 , x) ∈ Rm+1 | Q(p, p) = −1, x0 > 0
is a smooth m-dimensional submanifold of Rm+1 and the tangent space
of Hm at p is given by

Tp Hm = v ∈ Rm+1 | Q(p, v) = 0 .
For p = (x0 , x) ∈ Rm+1 and v = (ξ0 , ξ) ∈ Rm+1 we have
p
p ∈ Hm ⇐⇒ x0 = 1 + |x|2 ,
⟨ξ, x⟩
v ∈ Tp Hm ⇐⇒ ξ0 = p
.
1 + |x|2
Now let us define a Riemannian metric on Hm by
gp (v, w) := Q(v, w)
= ⟨ξ, η⟩ − ξ0 η0
⟨ξ, x⟩⟨η, x⟩
= ⟨ξ, η⟩ −
1 + |x|2

(6.4.10)

for v = (ξ0 , ξ) ∈ Tp Hm and w = (η0 , η) ∈ Tp Hm .
Theorem 6.4.19. Hm is a connected, simply connected, complete Riemannian m-manifold with constant sectional curvature k = −1.

6.4. CONSTANT CURVATURE

We remark that the manifold Hm does not quite fit into the extrinsic
framework of most of this book as it is not exhibited as a submanifold
of Euclidean space but rather of “pseudo-Euclidean space”: the positive
definite inner product ⟨v, w⟩ of the ambient space Rm+1 is replaced by a
nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form Q(v, w). However, all the theory
developed thus far goes through (reading Q(v, w) for ⟨v, w⟩) provided we
impose the additional hypothesis (true in the example M = Hm ) that the
first fundamental form gp = Q|Tp M is positive definite. For then Q|Tp M is
nondegenerate and we may define the orthogonal projection Π(p) onto Tp M
as before. The next lemma summarizes the basic observations; the proof is
an exercise in linear algebra.
Lemma 6.4.20. Let Q be a symmetric bilinear form on a vector space V
and for each subspace E of V define its orthogonal complement by
E ⊥Q := {u ∈ V | Q(u, v) = 0 ∀v ∈ E} .
Assume Q is nondegenerate, i.e. V ⊥Q = {0}. Then, for every linear subspace E ⊂ V , we have
V = E ⊕ E ⊥Q

⇐⇒

E ∩ E ⊥Q = {0},

i.e. E ⊥Q is a vector space complement of E if and only if the restriction
of Q to E is nondegenerate.
Proof of Theorem 6.4.19. The proofs of the various properties of Hm are
entirely analogous to the corresponding proofs for S m . Thus the unit normal
field to Hm is given by
ν(p) = p
for p ∈ Hm although the “square of its length” is
Q(p, p) = −1.
For p ∈ Hm we introduce the Q-orthogonal projection Π(p) of Rm+1 onto
the subspace Tp Hm . It is characterized by the conditions
Π(p)2 = Π(p),

ker Π(p) ⊥Q imΠ(p),

and is given by the explicit formula
Π(p)v = v + Q(v, p)p
for v ∈ Rm+1 .

imΠ(p) = Tp Hm ,

288

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

The covariant derivative of a vector field X ∈ Vect(γ) along a smooth
curve γ : R → Hm is given by
∇X(t) = Π(γ(t))Ẋ(t)
= Ẋ(t) + Q(Ẋ(t), γ(t))γ(t)
= Ẋ(t) − Q(X(t), γ̇(t))γ(t).
The last identity follows by differentiating the equation Q(X, γ) ≡ 0. This
can be interpreted as the hyperbolic Gauß–Weingarten formula as follows.
For p ∈ Hm and u ∈ Tp Hm we introduce, as before, the second fundamental
form
hp (u) : Tp Hm → (Tp Hm )⊥Q
via

hp (u)v := dΠ(p)u v
and denote its Q-adjoint by
hp (u)∗ : (Tp Hm )⊥Q → Tp Hm .
For all p ∈ Hm , u ∈ Tp Hm , and v ∈ Rm+1 we have




d
dΠ(p)u v =
v + Q(v, p + tu)(p + tu)
dt t=0
= Q(v, p)u + Q(v, u)p,

where the first summand on the right is tangent to Hm and the second
summand is Q-orthogonal to Tp Hm . Hence
hp (u)v = Q(v, u)p,

hp (u)∗ w = Q(w, p)u

(6.4.11)

for v ∈ Tp Hm and w ∈ (Tp Hm )⊥Q .
With this understood, the Gauß-Weingarten formula
Ẋ = ∇X + hγ (γ̇)X
extends to the present setting. The reader may verify that the operators
∇ : Vect(γ) → Vect(γ)
thus defined satisfy the axioms of Theorem 3.7.8 and hence define the LeviCivita connection on Hm .

6.4. CONSTANT CURVATURE

Now a smooth curve γ : I → Hm is a geodesic if and only if it satisfies
the equivalent conditions
∇γ̇ ≡ 0

⇐⇒

γ̈(t) ⊥Q Tγ(t) Hm ∀ t ∈ I

⇐⇒

γ̈ = Q(γ̇, γ̇)γ.

A geodesic must satisfy the equation
d
Q(γ̇, γ̇) = 2Q(γ̈, γ̇) = 0
dt
because γ̈ is a scalar multiple of γ, and hence Q(γ̇, γ̇) is constant. Fix an
element p ∈ Hm and a tangent vector v ∈ Tp Hm such that
Q(v, v) = 1.
Then the geodesic γ : R → Hm with γ(0) = p and γ̇(0) = v is given by
γ(t) = cosh(t)p + sinh(t)v,

(6.4.12)

where

et − e−t
et + e−t
,
sinh(t) :=
.

2
In fact we have γ̈(t) = γ(t) ⊥Q Tγ(t) Hm . It follows that the geodesics
exist for all time and hence Hm is geodesically complete. Moreover, being
diffeomorphic to Euclidean space, Hm is connected and simply connected.
It remains to prove that Hm has constant sectional curvature k = −1.
To see this we use the Gauß–Codazzi formula in the hyperbolic setting, i.e.
cosh(t) :=

Rp (u, v) = hp (u)∗ hp (v) − hp (v)∗ hp (u).

(6.4.13)

By equation (6.4.11), this gives
⟨Rp (u, v)v, u⟩ = Q(hp (u)u, hp (v)v) − Q(hp (v)u, hp (u)v)
= Q(Q(u, u)p, Q(v, v)p) − Q(Q(u, v)p, Q(u, v)p)
= −Q(u, u)Q(v, v) + Q(u, v)2
= −gp (u, u)gp (v, v) + gp (u, v)2
for all u, v ∈ Tp Hm . Hence, for every p ∈ M and every 2-dimensional linear
subspace E ⊂ Tp M with a basis u, v ∈ E we have
K(p, E) =

⟨Rp (u, v)v, u⟩
= −1.
gp (u, u)gp (v, v) − gp (u, v)2

This proves Theorem 6.4.19.

6.5. NONPOSITIVE SECTIONAL CURVATURE

293

Nonpositive Sectional Curvature

In the previous section we have seen that any two points in a connected,
simply connected, complete manifold M of constant negative curvature are
joined by a unique geodesic (Exercise 6.4.26). Thus the entire manifold M
is geodesically convex and its injectivity radius is infinity. This continues
to hold in much greater generality for manifolds with nonpositive sectional
curvature. It is convenient, at this point, to extend the discussion to Riemannian manifolds in the intrinsic setting. In particular, at some point in
the proof of the main theorem of this section and in our main example, we
shall work with a Riemannian metric that does not arise (in any obvious
way) from an embedding.
Definition 6.5.1. A Riemannian manifold M is said to have nonpositive sectional curvature iff K(p, E) ≤ 0 for every p ∈ M and every 2dimensional linear subspace E ⊂ Tp M or, equivalently, ⟨Rp (u, v)v, u⟩ ≤ 0 for
all p ∈ M and all u, v ∈ Tp M . A nonempty, connected, simply connected,
complete Riemannan manifold with nonpositive sectional curvature is called
a Hadamard manifold.

6.5.1

The Cartan–Hadamard Theorem

The next theorem shows that every Hadamard manifold is diffeomorphic to
Euclidean space and has infinite injectivity radius. This is in sharp contrast
to positive curvature manifolds as the example M = S m shows.
Theorem 6.5.2 (Cartan–Hadamard). Let M be a connected, simply connected, complete Riemannan manifold. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) M has nonpositive sectional curvature.
(ii) The derivative of each exponential map is length increasing, i.e.
d expp (v)b
v ≥ |b
v|
for all p ∈ M and all v, vb ∈ Tp M .
(iii) Each exponential map is distance increasing, i.e.
d(expp (v0 ), expp (v1 )) ≥ |v0 − v1 |
for all p ∈ M and all v0 , v1 ∈ Tp M .
Moreover, if these equivalent conditions are satisfied, then the exponential
map expp : Tp M → M is a diffeomorphism for every p ∈ M . Thus any two
points in M are joined by a unique geodesic.
The proof makes use of the following two exercises.

ξ(t)

with η(t) = O(t3 ) and η̇(t) = O(t2 ). Show that the terms of order 2 and 4
cancel in the Taylor expansion at t = 0.
Proof of Theorem 6.5.2. We prove that (i) implies (ii). Fix a point p ∈ M
and two tangent vectors v, vb ∈ Tp M . Assume without loss of generality
that vb ̸= 0 and define the curve γ : R → M and the vector field X ∈ Vect(γ)
along γ by
γ(t) := expp (tv),

X(t) :=

∂
expp (t(v + sb
v )) ∈ Tγ(t) M
∂s s=0

(6.5.1)

for t ∈ R. Then
X(0) = 0,

X(t) = d expp (tv)tb
v,

∇X(0) = vb ̸= 0.

(6.5.2)

To see this, define the map β : R2 → M by β(s, t) := expp (t(v + sb
v )). It
satisfies β(0, t) = γ(t), ∂s β(0, t) = X(t), β(s, 0) = p, and ∂t β(s, 0) = v + sb
v
for all s, t ∈ R. Hence ∇X(0) = ∇t ∂s β(0, 0) = ∇s ∂t β(0, 0) = vb. Moreover,
the curve β(s, ·) is a geodesic for every s, and hence Lemma 6.1.18 asserts
that X = ∂s β(0, ·) is a Jacobi field along γ, i.e.
∇∇X + R(X, γ̇)γ̇ = 0.

(6.5.3)

6.5. NONPOSITIVE SECTIONAL CURVATURE

295

It follows from Exercise 6.5.3 with ξ(t) := Φγ (0, t)X(t) that the function
[0, ∞) → R : t 7→ |X(t)|
is smooth and

d
|X(t)| = |∇X(0)| = |b

Moreover, for t > 0, we have

|X|3
|X|
≥ 0.

(6.5.4)

Here the third equality follows from the fact that X is a Jacobi field along γ,
and the inequality follows from the nonpositive sectional curvature condition
in (i) and from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. Thus the second derivative
of the function [0, ∞) → R : t 7→ |X(t)| − t |b
v | is nonnegative; so its first
derivative is nondecreasing and it vanishes at t = 0; thus
|X(t)| − t |b
v| ≥ 0
for every t ≥ 0. In particular, for t = 1 we obtain
v| .
v = |X(1)| ≥ |b
d expp (v)b
as claimed. Thus we have proved that (i) implies (ii).
We prove that (ii) implies (i). Assume, by contradiction, that (ii) holds
but there exists a point p ∈ M and a pair of vectors v, vb ∈ Tp M such that
⟨Rp (v, vb)v, vb⟩ < 0.

(6.5.5)

Define γ : R → M and X ∈ Vect(γ) by (6.5.1) so that (6.5.2) and (6.5.3)
are satisfied. Thus X is a Jacobi field with
X(0) = 0,

∇X(0) = vb ̸= 0.

Hence it follows from Exercise 6.5.4 with ξ(t) := Φγ (0, t)X(t) that there is a
constant c > 0 such that, for t > 0 sufficiently small, we have the inequality
|X(t)|2 |∇X(t)|2 − ⟨X(t), ∇X(t)⟩2 ≤ ct6 .

296

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Moreover, by (6.5.1) and (6.5.2), limt↘0 γ̇(t) = v and limt↘0 t−1 X(t) = vb.
Hence, by (6.5.5) there exist constants δ > 0 and ε > 0 such that
|X(t)| ≥ δt,

⟨X(t), R(γ̇(t), X(t))γ̇(t)⟩ ≤ −εt2 ,

for t > 0 sufficiently small. By (6.5.4) this implies

Hence it follows from (6.5.2) that
v|
d expp (tv)tb
v = |X(t)| < t |∇X(0)| = t |b
for t > 0 sufficiently small. This contradicts (ii).
We prove that (ii) implies that the exponential map expp : Tp M → M is
a diffeomorphism for every p ∈ M . By (ii) expp is a local diffeomorphism, i.e.
its derivative d expp (v) : Tp M → Texpp (v) M is bijective for every v ∈ Tp M .
Hence we can define a Riemannian metric on M ′ := Tp M by pulling back
the metric on M under the exponential map. To make this more explicit we
choose a basis e1 , . . . , em of Tp M and define the map ψ : Rm → M by
!

ψ(x) := expp

for x = (x1 , . . . , xm ) ∈ Rm . Define the metric tensor by

i, j = 1, . . . , m.
∂xi
∂x
Then (Rm , g) is a Riemannian manifold (covered by a single coordinate
chart) and ψ : (Rm , g) → M is a local isometry, by definition of g. The
manifold (Rm , g) is clearly connected and simply connected. Moreover, for
every ξ = (ξ 1 , . . . , ξ n ) ∈ Rm = T0 Rm , the curve R → Rm : t 7→ tξ is a
geodesic with respect to g (because ψ is a local isometry and the image of
the curve under ψ is a geodesic in M ). Hence it follows from Theorem 4.6.5
that (Rm , g) is complete.

6.5. NONPOSITIVE SECTIONAL CURVATURE

Since both (Rm , g) and M are connected, simply connected, and complete, it follows from Corollary 6.1.15 that the local isometry ψ is bijective.
Thus the exponential map expp : Tp M → M is a diffeomorphism as claimed.
It follows that any two points in M are joined by a unique geodesic.
We prove that (ii) implies (iii). Fix a point p ∈ M and two tangent
vectors v0 , v1 ∈ Tp M . Let γ : [0, 1] → M be the geodesic with the endpoints
γ(0) = expp (v0 ),

γ(1) = expp (v1 )

and let v : [0, 1] → Tp M be the unique curve satisfying expp (v(t)) = γ(t) for
all t. Then v(0) = v0 , v(1) = v1 , and
d(expp (v0 ), expp (v1 )) = L(γ)

= |v1 − v0 | .
Here the third inequality follows from (ii). This shows that (ii) implies (iii).
We prove that (iii) implies (ii). Fix a point p ∈ M and a tangent
vector v ∈ Tp M and denote q := expp (v). By (iii) the exponential map
expq : Tq M → M is injective and, since M is complete, it is bijective (see
Theorem 4.6.6). Hence there exists a unique geodesic from q to any other
point in M and therefore, by Theorem 4.4.4, we have
|w| = d(q, expq (w))

(6.5.6)

for every w ∈ Tq M . Now define ϕ := exp−1
q ◦ expp : Tp M → Tq M. This
map satisfies ϕ(v) = 0. Moreover, it is differentiable in a neighborhood of v
and, by the chain rule, dϕ(v) = d expp (v) : Tp M → Tq M. Now choose
w := ϕ(v + vb) with vb ∈ Tp M . Then expq (w) = expq (ϕ(v + vb)) = expp (v + vb)
and hence it follows from (6.5.6) and part (iii) that
|ϕ(v + vb))| = |w| = d(q, expq (w)) = d(expp (v), expp (v + vb)) ≥ |b
v| .
This gives

Proof. The first inequality in (6.5.7) is part (iii) of Theorem 6.5.2. To prove
the second inequality, assume v0 ̸= v1 and define
γ0 (t) := expp (tv0 ),

γ1 (t) := expp (tv1 )

for t ∈ R. For each t ∈ R let the curve [0, 1] → M : s 7→ γ(s, t) be the unique
geodesic with the endpoints γ(0, t) = γ0 (t) and γ(1, t) = γ1 (t). Then

the nonpositive sectional curvature assumption. Thus ρ : [0, T ] → R is a
convex function satisfying ρ(0) = 0 and hence ρ(t) ≤ tρ(T )/T for 0 ≤ t ≤ T .
This proves Lemma 6.5.5.

Cartan’s Fixed Point Theorem

Recall from Definition 6.5.1 that a Hadamard manifold is a nonempty, connected, simply connected, complete Riemannian manifold of nonpositive
sectional curvature.
Theorem 6.5.6 (Cartan). Let M be a Hadamard manifold and let G be a
compact topological group that acts on M by isometries. Then there exists
a point p ∈ M such that gp = p for every g ∈ G.
The proof follows the argument given by Bill Casselmann in [16] and
requires the following two lemmas. The first lemma asserts that every complete, connected, simply connected Riemannian manifold of nonpositive sectional curvature is a semi-hyperbolic space in the sense of Alexandrov [3].

p1 := expm (v).

Then

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Proof. By Theorem 6.5.2 the exponential map expm : Tm M → M is a
diffeomorphism. Hence d(p0 , p1 ) = 2|v|. Now let q ∈ M . Then there is a
unique tangent vector w ∈ Tm M such that
d(m, q) = |w|.

q = expm (w),

Since the exponential map is expanding, by Theorem 6.5.2, we have
d(p0 , q) ≥ |w + v|,

d(p1 , q) ≥ |w − v|.

Hence
d(m, q)2 = |w|2

Lemma 6.5.9 (Serre). Let M be a Hadamard manifold and, for p ∈ M

Let Ω ⊂ M be a nonempty bounded set and define
rΩ := inf {r > 0 | there exists a p ∈ M such that Ω ⊂ B(p, r)} .
Then there exists a unique point pΩ ∈ M such that Ω ⊂ B(pΩ , rΩ ) (see

Proof. We prove existence. Choose sequences ri > rΩ and pi ∈ M such that
Ω ⊂ B(pi , ri ),

lim ri = rΩ .

i→∞

Choose q ∈ Ω. Then d(q, pi ) ≤ ri for every i. Since the sequence ri is
bounded and M is complete, it follows that pi has a convergent subsequence,
still denoted by pi . Its limit
pΩ := lim pi
i→∞

satisfies Ω ⊂ B(pΩ , rΩ ).
We prove uniqueness. Let p0 , p1 ∈ M such that
Ω ⊂ B(p0 , rΩ ) ∩ B(p1 , rΩ ).
Since the exponential map expp : Tp M → M is a diffeomorphism (by Theorem 6.5.2), there exists a unique vector v0 ∈ Tp0 M such that p1 = expp0 (v0 ).
Denote the midpoint between p0 and p1 by

that d(p0 , p1 ) = 0 and hence p0 = p1 . This proves Lemma 6.5.9.
Proof of Theorem 6.5.6. Let q ∈ M and consider the group orbit
Ω := {gq | g ∈ G} .
Since G is compact, this set is bounded. Let rΩ and pΩ be as in Lemma 6.5.9.
Then Ω ⊂ B(pΩ , rΩ ). Since G acts on M by isometries, this implies
Ω = gΩ ⊂ B(gpΩ , rΩ )
for all g ∈ G. Hence it follows from the uniqueness statement in Lemma 6.5.9
that gpΩ = pΩ for every g ∈ G. This proves Theorem 6.5.6.

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Positive Definite Symmetric Matrices

We close this section with an example of a nonpositive sectional curvature
manifold which plays a key role in Donaldson’s approach to Lie algebra
theory [17] (see §7.5.2). Let m be a positive integer and consider the space
o
n
(6.5.10)
P := P(Rm ) := P ∈ Rm×m P T = P > 0
of positive definite symmetric m × m-matrices. (Here the notation “P > 0”
means ⟨x, P x⟩ > 0 for every nonzero vector x ∈ Rm .) Thus P is an open
subset of the vector space S := {S ∈ Rm×m | S T = S} of symmetric matrices and hence the tangent space of P is TP P = S for every P ∈ P.
However, we do not use the metric inherited from the inclusion into S but
define a Riemannian metric by

(6.5.11)
⟨Pb1 , Pb2 ⟩P := trace Pb1 P −1 Pb2 P −1
for P ∈ P and Pb1 , Pb2 ∈ TP P = S .
Theorem 6.5.10. The space P with the Riemannian metric (6.5.11) is a
connected, simply connected, complete Riemannian manifold with nonpositive sectional curvature, and the distance function on P is given by
r

2 
d(P, Q) = trace log(P −1/2 QP −1/2 )
(6.5.12)
for P, Q ∈ P. Moreover, P is a symmetric space and the group GL(m, R)
of nonsingular m × m-matrices acts on P by isometries via P 7→ gP g T
for g ∈ GL(m, R).
Proof. See below.
Remark 6.5.11. Let V be an m-dimensional vector space and H ⊂ S 2 V ∗
be the set of inner products on V . Define a Riemannian metric on H by
⟨b
h1 , b
h2 ⟩h := trace(S1 S2 ),
h(·, Si ·) := b
hi ,
(6.5.13)
for h ∈ H and b
h1 , b
h2 ∈ Th H = S 2 V ∗ . Then every vector space isomorphism α : Rm → V determines a diffeomorphism ϕα : H → P via
h(αξ, αη) = ⟨ξ, P −1 η⟩Rm .
The derivative of ϕα at h in the direction b
h ∈ Th H is given by
ϕα (h) = P

dϕα (h)b
h = Pb

⇐⇒

⇐⇒

PbP −1 = −α−1 Sα,

h(·, S·) := b
h.

(6.5.14)

(6.5.15)

Thus ϕα is an isometry with respect to the Riemannian metrics (6.5.13)
on H and (6.5.11) on P. The ϕα form an atlas on H with the transition
T
−1
maps ϕβα (P ) := ϕβ ◦ ϕ−1
α (P ) = gβα P gβα , where gβα := β α ∈ GL(m, R).

Remark 6.5.12. The submanifold
P0 := P0 (Rm ) := {P ∈ P | det(P ) = 1}

(6.5.16)

of positive definite symmetric m × m-matrices with determinant one is totally geodesic (see Remark 6.5.13 below). Hence all the assertions of Theorem 6.5.10 (with GL(m, R) replaced by SL(m, R)) remain valid for P0 .
Remark 6.5.13. Let M be a Riemannian manifold and L ⊂ M be a submanifold. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) If γ : I → M is a geodesic on an open interval I such that 0 ∈ I and
γ(0) ∈ L,

γ̇(0) ∈ Tγ(0) L,

then there is a constant ε > 0 such that γ(t) ∈ L for |t| < ε.
(ii) If γ : I → L is a smooth curve on an open interval I and Φγ denotes
parallel transport along γ in M , then
Φγ (t, s)Tγ(s) L = Tγ(t) L

∀ s, t ∈ I.

(iii) If γ : I → L is a smooth curve on an open interval I and X ∈ Vect(γ)
is a vector field along γ (with values in T M ), then
X(t) ∈ Tγ(t) L ∀ t ∈ I

=⇒

∇X(t) ∈ Tγ(t) L

∀ t ∈ I.

A submanifold that satisfies these equivalent conditions is called totally
geodesic.
Exercise 6.5.14. Prove the equivalence of (i), (ii), (iii) in Remark 6.5.13.
Hint: Choose suitable coordinates and translate each of the three assertions
into conditions on the Christoffel symbols.
Exercise 6.5.15. Prove that P0 is a totally geodesic submanifold of P.
Prove that P is diffeomorphic to the quotient GL(m, R)/O(m) via polar decomposition and that P0 is diffeomorphic to thep
quotient SL(m, R)/SO(m).
Hint: Consider the map GL(m, R) → P : g 7→ gg T .
Exercise 6.5.16. In the case m = 2 prove that P0 is isometric to the
hyperbolic space H2 .
The proof of Theorem 6.5.10 is based on the calculation of the Levi-Civita
connection and the formulas for geodesics and the Riemann curvature tensor
in the following three lemmas.

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Lemma 6.5.17. Let I → P : t 7→ P (t) be a smooth path in P on an
interval I ⊂ R and let I → S : t 7→ S(t) be a vector field along P . Then
the covariant derivative of S is given by
1

∇S = Ṡ − SP −1 Ṗ − Ṗ P −1 S.

(6.5.17)

Proof. The formula (6.5.17) determines a family of linear operators on the
spaces of vector fields along paths that satisfy the torsion-free condition
∇s ∂t P = ∇t ∂s P
for every smooth map R2 → P : (s, t) 7→ P (s, t) and the Leibniz rule
∇ ⟨S1 , S2 ⟩P = ⟨∇S1 , S2 ⟩P + ⟨S1 , ∇S2 ⟩P
for any two vector fields S1 and S2 along P . These two conditions determine
the covariant derivative uniquely (see Lemma 3.6.5 and Theorem 3.7.8).
This proves Lemma 6.5.17.
Lemma 6.5.18. The geodesics in P are given by

for P ∈ P, Pb ∈ TP P = S , and t ∈ R. In particular, P is complete.
Proof. The curve γ : R → P defined by (6.5.18) satisfies

γ̇(t) = Pb exp tP −1 Pb = PbP −1 γ(t).
Hence it follows from Lemma 6.5.17 that
∇γ̇(t) = γ̈(t) − γ̇(t)γ(t)−1 γ̇(t)
= γ̈(t) − PbP −1 γ̇(t)
=0
for every t ∈ R. Hence γ is a geodesic. Since the curve γ : R → P in (6.5.18)
satisfies γ(0) = P and γ̇(0) = Pb, this proves Lemma 6.5.18.

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Proof of Theorem 6.5.10. The manifold P is obviously connected and simply connected as it is a convex open subset of a finite-dimensional vector
space. That the map GL(m, R) × P → P : (g, P ) 7→ gP g T defines a group
action of GL(m, R) on P by isometries follows directly from the definitions.
The remaining assertions will be proved in three steps.
Step 1. The manifold P has nonpositive sectional curvature.
By Lemma 6.5.19 with A = T and equation (6.5.11) we have
⟨S, RP (S, T )T ⟩P

Thus ⟨S, RP (S, T )T ⟩P ≤ 0 for all P ∈ P and S, T ∈ S . This proves Step 1.
Step 2. P is a symmetric space.
Fix an element A ∈ P and define the map ϕ : P → P by ϕ(P ) := AP −1 A
for P ∈ P. This map is a diffeomorphism, fixes the matrix A = ϕ(A), and
its derivative at P ∈ P is given by dϕ(P )Pb = −AP −1 PbP −1 A for Pb ∈ TP P.
Hence dϕ(A) = −id. Moreover, (dϕ(P )Pb)ϕ(P )−1 = −AP −1 PbA−1 and so


2 
2 
|dϕ(P )Pb|2ϕ(P ) = trace AP −1 PbA−1
= trace P −1 Pb
= |Pb|2P
for all P ∈ P and Pb ∈ TP P. Thus ϕ is an isometry and this proves Step 2.
Step 3. The distance function on P is given by (6.5.12).
Let P, Q ∈ P. Then, since P is a Hadamard manifold by Step 1 and
Lemma 6.5.18, there exists a unique matrix Pb ∈ S such that expP (Pb) = Q.
By Lemma 6.5.18 this equation reads P 1/2 exp(P −1/2 PbP −1/2 )P 1/2 = Q.
Thus S := P −1/2 PbP −1/2 = log(P −1/2 QP −1/2 ) and


d(P, Q)2 = |Pb|2P = trace PbP −1 PbP −1 = trace S 2 .
This proves Step 3 and Theorem 6.5.10.

Remark 6.5.20. Theorem 6.5.10 carries over to the complex setting as
follows. Replace P by the space

Q := Q ∈ Cm×m Q∗ = Q > 0
(6.5.20)
of positive definite Hermitian matrices. Here Q∗ denotes the conjugate transposed matrix of Q ∈ Cm×m and the notation “Q > 0” means z ∗ Qz > 0 for
every nonzero vector z ∈ Cm . Thus Q is an open subset of the vector space
of Hermitian m × m-matrices. Define the Riemannian metric on Q by

⟨H1 , H2 ⟩Q := Re trace(H1 Q−1 H2 Q−1 )
for Q ∈ Q and H1 , H2 ∈ TQ Q. Then all the assertions of Theorem 6.5.10
(with GL(m, R) replaced by GL(m, C)) carry over to Q. The proof is verbatim the same, with the transposed matric replaced by the conjugate tramsposed matrix and the trace replaced by the real part of the trace.

Remark 6.5.21. The set Q0 := Q ∈ Q det(Q) = 1 of positive definite
Hermitian matrices with determinant one is a totally geodesic submanifold
of Q. Hence all the assertions of Theorem 6.5.10 (with GL(m, R) replaced
by SL(m, C)) remain valid for Q0 .
Exercise 6.5.22. Show that Theorem 6.5.10 remains valid for Q, and Q0
is a totally geodesic submanifold of Q. Prove that Q is diffeomorphic to
the quotient GL(m, C)/U(m) and Q0 is diffeomorphic to SL(m, C)/SU(m).
√
Hint: Consider the map SL(m, C) → Q0 : g 7→ gg ∗ . Show that the pullback metric on SL(m, C)/SU(m) is given by the norm of the Hermitian part
of the matrix g −1 gb for gb ∈ Tg SL(m, C).
Exercise 6.5.23. In the case m = 2 prove that Q0 is isometric to the
hyperbolic space H3 .
The space Q0 ∼
= SL(m, C)/SU(m) (with nonpositive sectional curvature)
can be viewed as a kind of dual space of the Lie group SU(m) (with nonnegative sectional curvature). They have the same dimension and in both
cases the Riemann curvature tensor is given by the Lie bracket (see equation (5.2.23) for SU(m) and equation (6.5.19) for Q0 ). One can think of
the noncompact Lie group Gc := SL(m, C) as the complexification of the
compact Lie group G := SU(m). It can be written in the form
Gc = {exp(iη)u | u ∈ G, η ∈ g} ,

(6.5.21)

the Lie algebra of Gc is the complexification gc = g ⊕ ig of the Lie algebra
of G, and the quotient Gc /G is a Hadamard manifold. These observations
carry over to all Lie subgroups G ⊂ SU(m). For an exposition see [20].

Positive Ricci Curvature*

In this section we prove that every complete connected manifold M ⊂ Rn
whose Ricci curvature satisfies a uniform positive lower bound is necessarily
compact. If the sectional curvature is constant and positive, this follows
from Corollary 6.4.12 as was noted in Example 6.4.16.
Definition 6.6.1 (Ricci tensor). Let M ⊂ Rn be an m-dimensional submanifold and fix an element p ∈ M . The Ricci tensor of M at p is the
symmetric bilinear form
Ricp : Tp M × Tp M → R
defined by
Ricp (u, v) :=

m
X
⟨Rp (ei , u)v, ei ⟩,

where e1 , . . . , em is an orthonormal basis of Tp M . The Ricci tensor is independent of the choice of this orthonormal frame and is symmetric by equations (5.2.17) and (5.2.19) in Theorem 5.2.14.

The Ricci Tensor in Local Coordinates
Let ϕ : U → Ω be a local coordinate chart on an open set U ⊂ M with values
in an open set Ω ⊂ Rm , denote its inverse by ψ := ϕ−1 : Ω → U, and let
Ei (x) :=

∂ψ
(x) ∈ Tψ(x) M,
∂xi

x ∈ Ω,

i = 1, . . . , m,

be the local frame of the tangent bundle determined by this coordinate chart.

The Bonnet–Myers Theorem
Theorem 6.6.2 (Bonnet–Myers). Let M ⊂ Rn be a complete, connected

for every p ∈ M and every v ∈ Tp M . Then d(p, q) ≤ π/ δ for all p, q ∈ M
and hence M is compact.
The proof is based on the following lemma.
Lemma 6.6.3. Let R × [0, 1] → M : (s, t) 7→ γs (t) be a smooth map such
that γ := γ0 : [0, 1] → M is a geodesic and γs (0) = γ(0) and γs (1) = γ(1)

This proves the first equality in (6.6.4). To prove the second equality
in (6.6.4) use integration by parts and the fact that X(0) = 0 and X(1) = 0.
This proves Lemma 6.6.3.

6.6. POSITIVE RICCI CURVATURE*

Proof of Theorem 6.6.2. Let p, q ∈ M . By the Hopf–Rinow Theorem 4.6.6
there exists a geodesic γ : [0, 1] → M such that
γ(0) = p,

γ(1) = q,

L(γ) = d(p, q).

Let X ∈ Vect(γ) be a vector field along γ such that X(0) = 0 and X(1) = 0
and define γs (t) := expγ(t) (sX(t)) for s ∈ R and 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Then s = 0 is
the absolute minimum of the function R → R : s 7→ E(γs ) by Lemma 4.4.1.

Now assume p ̸= q and choose an orthonormal frame E1 , . . . , Em along γ
such that E1 = γ̇/|γ̇| and ∇t Ei ≡ 0 for i = 1, . . . m. Define
Xi (t) := sin(πt)Ei (t)
for i = 1, . . . m and 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Then |∇t Xi (t)| = π cos(πt) for all i and t and

Here the third step uses (6.6.5). Since m ≥ 2 it follows from this estimate
that d(p, q)2 ≤ π 2 /δ and this proves Theorem 6.6.2.
A direct consequence of Theorem 6.6.2 is that every compact manifold
with positive Ricci curvature has a compact universal cover and hence has
a finite fundamental group.

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Positive Sectional Curvature
Corollary 6.6.4. Let M ⊂ Rn be a complete, connected manifold of dimension m ≥ 2 and suppose that there exists a δ > 0 such that
K(p, E) ≥ δ
for every p ∈ M and every 2-dimensional linear subspace E ⊂ Tp M . Then
π
d(p, q) ≤ √
δ
for all p, q ∈ M and hence M is compact.
Proof. The condition K ≥ δ implies (6.6.3) with m := dim(M ) and hence
the assertion follows from Theorem 6.6.2. This proves Corollary 6.6.4.
The example of the m-sphere shows that the estimate in Corollary 6.6.4
is sharp. Namely, M := S m has sectional curvature K = 1 and diameter π.
The paraboloid M := (x, y, z) ∈ R3 | z = x2 + y 2 } has positive Gaußian
curvature and so positive Ricci curvature (Lemma 6.7.2) but is noncompact.
Remark 6.6.5 (Sphere Theorem). The Topological Sphere Theorem
asserts that every complete, connected, simply connected Riemannian mmanifold M whose sectional curvature satisfies the estimate
1/4 < K(p, E) ≤ 1
for every p ∈ M and every 2-dimensional linear subspace E ⊂ Tp M must be
homeomorphic to the m-sphere. The Differentiable Sphere Theorem
asserts under the same assumptions that M is diffeomorphic to S m .
The problem goes back to a question posed by Heinz Hopf [31, 32] in the
1920s. After intermediate results by Rauch [57] (with 1/4 replaced by 3/4)
and others, the Toplogical Sphere Theorem was proved in 1961 by Berger [6]
and Klingenberg [41]. The Differentiable Sphere Theorem was proved in
2007 by Brendle and Schoen [8, 9, 10]. They even weakened the assumption
to 0 < maxE K(p, E) < 4 minE K(p, E) for all p ∈ M , where the maximum
and minimum are taken over all 2-dimensional linear subspaces E ⊂ Tp M .
The Topological Sphere Theorem is sharp, as the suitably scaled Fubini–
Study metric on complex projective space satisfies 1/4 ≤ K(p, E) ≤ 1 for
all p and E. The Differentiable Sphere Theorem is a significant improvement, because in many dimensions there exist smooth m-manifolds that are
homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic, to S m . These are the so-called exotic spheres and many of those do not even admit metrics of positive scalar
curvature [30]. (For the definition of scalar curvature see §6.7.)

Scalar Curvature*

This section introduces the scalar curvature and explains how it is related to
the Ricci tensor and the Riemann curvature tensor in dimensions 2 and 3.
The section also includes a brief discussion of several problems in differential
geometry in which the scalar curvature plays a central role.

Definition and Basic Properties
Let m be a positive integer and let M ⊂ Rn be an m-manifold. For each
element p ∈ M denote by Rp : Tp M × Tp M → End(Tp M ) the Riemann curvature tensor and by Ricp : Tp M × Tp M → R the Ricci tensor of M at p.
Definition 6.7.1 (Scalar curvature). Fix an element p ∈ M . The scalar
curvature S(p) of M at p is the trace of the Ricci tensor and is given by
S(p) :=

m

Ricp (ei , ei ) =

i=1

m
X

⟨Rp (ei , ej )ej , ei ⟩,

(6.7.1)

i,j=1

where e1 , . . . , em is an orthonormal basis of Tp M . The scalar curvature is
independent of the choice of this orthonormal frame.
Lemma 6.7.2. Assume m = 2 and let K : M → R be the Gaußian curvature
of M in (6.4.2). Then
S(p) = 2K(p),

Ricp (u, v) = K(p)⟨u, v⟩,


⟨Rp (u, v)w, z⟩ = K(p) ⟨u, z⟩⟨v, w⟩ − ⟨u, w⟩⟨v, z⟩

(6.7.2)
(6.7.3)

for all p ∈ M and u, v, w, z ∈ Tp M .
Proof. By definition, the Gaußian curvature is given by
K(p) =

⟨Rp (u, v)v, u⟩
|u|2 |v|2 − ⟨u, v⟩2

(6.7.4)

for every pair of linearly independent tangent vectors u, v ∈ Tp M . Take u
to be a unit vector orthogonal to v to obtain Ricp (v, v) = K(p)|v|2 for
every v ∈ Tp M . Since Ricp : Tp M × Tp M → R is a symmetric bilinear form,
this implies the second equality in (6.7.2). With this understood the first
equality in (6.7.2) follows directly from the definition of the scalar curvature
in (6.7.1). Equation (6.7.3) follows from (6.7.4) by Theorem 6.4.8. This
proves Lemma 6.7.2.

define the endomorphism

by
Qp u :=

X

Rp (u, ei )ei

for u ∈ Tp M . The right hand side of this equation is independent of the
choice of the orthonormal basis and the endomorphism Qp satisfies
trace(Qp ) = S(p)
and
⟨Qp u, v⟩ = Ricp (u, v)
for all u, v ∈ Tp M . With this notation equation (6.7.5) takes the form

It suffices to verify equation (6.7.6) in the following three cases.
(a) u, v are linarly dependent.
(b) u, v, w are orthonormal.
(c) u, v are orthonormal and w = v.
In the case (a) both sides of equation (6.7.6) vanish. In the case (b) we have
Rp (u, v)w = ⟨Rp (u, v)w, u⟩u + ⟨Rp (u, v)w, v⟩v
= Ricp (v, w)u − Ricp (u, w)v,
and this is equivalent to (6.7.6).

In the case (c) equaton (6.7.6) takes the form
S(p)
(6.7.7)
u.
2
To verify this formula, choose a unit vector w that is orthogonal to u and v.
Then it follows from the definition of S(p) and Qp that
Rp (u, v)v = Ricp (v, v)u − Ricp (u, v)v + Qp u −

S(p)
= ⟨Rp (u, v)v, u⟩ + ⟨Rp (w, v)v, w⟩ + ⟨Rp (u, w)w, u⟩
2
= Ricp (v, v) + ⟨Rp (u, w)w, u⟩,
and
Qp u = Rp (u, v)v + Rp (u, w)w
= Rp (u, v)v + ⟨Rp (u, w)w, v⟩v + ⟨Rp (u, w)w, u⟩u
S(p)
u − Ricp (v, v)u.
= Rp (u, v)v + Ricp (u, v)v +
2
This proves (6.7.7) and Lemma 6.7.3.

Scalar Curvature in Local Coordinates
Let ϕ : U → Ω be a local coordinate chart on an open set U ⊂ M with values
in an open set Ω ⊂ Rm , denote its inverse by
ψ := ϕ−1 : Ω → U,
and denote by
Ei (x) := ∂i ψ(x) ∈ Tψ(x) M
for x ∈ Ω and i = 1, . . . , m the local frame of the tangent bundle determined
by this coordinate chart. Denote the coefficients of the first fundamental
form by gij := ⟨Ei , Ej ⟩, of the Ricci tensor by
Ricij := Ric(Ei , Ej ),

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Positive Scalar Curvature
An important question for a compact smooth manifold M is whether or not
it admits a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature. A theorem of
Lichnerowicz [46] asserts that, if M is a compact spin manifold of dimension m = 4n that admits a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature,
b
then a certain characteristic class of this manifold (the A-genus)
must vanish. The definitions of the terms that appear in this sentence (spin structure
b
and A-genus)
as well as in the proof, which involves the Dirac operator, the
Atiyah–Singer index theorem, and the Weitzenböck formula, go beyond the
scope of the present book. For an exposition see [65, Theorem 6.30].
A nonlinear variant of Lichnerowicz’ theorem asserts that a compact
+
oriented smooth 4-manifold with b+
2 − b1 odd and b2 > 1 that admits a
Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature has vanishing Seiberg-Witten
invariants (see [65, Proposition 7.32]).
In another direction Gromov and Lawson [22] proved that if M1 and M2
are two compact manifolds of dimension m ≥ 3 that admit Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature, then so does their connected sum M1 #M2
(see also [65, Theorem 2.18]).
In the late 1970’s Schoen and Yau [70] proved, using minimal surfaces,
that the torus Tm = Rm /Zm does not admit a metric of positive scalar
b
curvature for m ≤ 7. We remark that the A-genus
of the torus vanishes and
so Lichnerowicz’ theorem does not apply. In [22] Gromov and Lawson refined
the techniques of Lichnerowicz to prove that, for any m, the m-torus does not
admit a metric of positive scalar curvature. In fact, they proved that for any
compact spin manifold M of dimension m the connected sum N := M #Tm
does not admit a metric of positive scalar curvature. Moreover, they proved
that if N admits a metric of nonnegative scalar curvature, then this metric
must be flat and N must be the standard m-torus.

Constant Scalar Curvature
An interesting class of Riemannian metrics consists of those that have constant scalar curvature. In dimension m = 2 the existence of such a metric
is the content of the uniformisation theorem. The proof involves the
solution of the Kazdan-Warner equation and goes beyond the scope of this
book. For an exposition see [65, Theorem 2.20 and Theorem D.1].
In dimension two Lemma 6.7.2 shows that the constant scalar curvature condition is equivalent to constant sectional curvature. However, in
higher dimensions the constant scalar curvature condition is more general.

6.7. SCALAR CURVATURE*

317

By Corollary 6.4.12 every compact simply connected m-manifold with constant sectional curvature is diffeomorphic to the m-sphere, while constant
scalar curvature metrics exist on every compact manifold. Examples are
the Fubini-Study metric on complex projective space (Example 2.8.5 and
Example 3.7.5), locally symmetric spaces (Theorem 6.3.4), and products of
Riemannian manifolds with constant scalar curvature.
Definition 6.7.4. Let M be a Riemannian manifold with the metric g. A
Riemannian metric g ′ on M is called conformally equivalent to g iff there
exists a smooth function λ : M → (0, ∞) such that g ′ = λg. The set of all
such Riemannian metrics is called the conformal class of g.
Remark 6.7.5 (Yamabe problem). The Yamabe problem asserts that
the conformal class of every Riemannian metric on a compact m-manifold M
of dimension m ≥ 2 contains a metric of constant scalar curvature.
This problem was formulated in 1960 by Hidehiko Yamabe and was eventually settled in the affirmative in 1984 by the combined work of Hidehiko Yamabe [78], Thierry Aubin [5], Neil Trudinger [75], and Richard
Schoen [69]. The proof for a compact manifold M of dimension m > 2
relies on finding a positive function f : M → R and a real number c that
satisfy the Yamabe equation
4(m − 1)
∆g f + Sg f = cf (m+2)/(m−2) .
m−2

(6.7.9)

Here Sg : M → R denotes the scalar curvature of the Riemannian metric g
and ∆g denotes its Laplace–Beltrami operator. In local coordinates this
operator is given by the formula

If f : M → (0, ∞) is a positive solution of (6.7.9), then the Riemannian
metric f 4/(m−2) g has the constant scalar curvature c. Exercise: Prove this.
Hint: Show first that
Su2 g = u−2 Sg + 2(m − 1)u−3 ∆g u − (m − 1)(m − 4)u−4 |du|2g .

(6.7.11)

Then take f := um/2−1 and use the identities
|dun |2g = n2 u2n−2 |du|2g ,

(6.7.12)

∆g un = nun−1 ∆g u + n(n − 1)un−2 |du|2g

(6.7.13)

for a smooth function u : M → (0, ∞) and a real number n > 0.

318

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Examples of constant scalar curvature metrics arise from the Einstein
condition (see Lemma 6.7.7 below).
Definition 6.7.6 (Einstein metric). A Riemannian manifold M is called
an Einstein manifold iff its Ricci tensor is a scalar multiple of the first
fundamental form, i.e. there exists a smooth function λ : M → R
Ricp (u, v) = λ(p)⟨u, v⟩

(6.7.14)

for all p ∈ M and all u, v ∈ Tp M . It follows from the definitions that the
factor λ in (6.7.14) is related to the scalar curvature S by
S
.
(6.7.15)

Lemma 6.7.2 shows that every Riemannian metric on a 2-manifold is an
Einstein metric and the factor λ = K is the Gaußian curvature.

Lemma 6.7.7. Let M be an Einstein manifold of dimension m ≥ 3. Then
the scalar curvature of M is locally constant.
Proof. Let p ∈ M . Then there exists a local orthonormal frame of the
tangent bundle E1 , . . . , Em ∈ Vect(U ) in a neighborhood U of p such that the
covariant derivatives ∇Ei all vanish at p. (Exercise: Prove this.) Denote
the deriviative of a function f at p in the direction Ei (p) by ∂i f . Then

Here the the first equality follows from the second Bianchi identity (6.3.7),
the second holds at p because ∇Ei (p) = 0, the third follows from the definitions of Ric and S, and the last uses the identity Ric(Ei , Ej ) = δij S/m,
which holds by (6.7.14) and (6.7.15). Since m ≥ 3 it follows that the derivative of S vanishes everywhere, and this proves Lemma 6.7.7.

6.8. THE WEYL TENSOR*

319

Examples of Einstein metrics include all constant sectional curvature
metrics by Theorem 6.4.8, the Fubini-Study metric on complex projective
space, and all metrics with vanishing Ricci tensor. Examples of the latter are Calabi–Yau metrics on complex manifolds and G2 -structures on 7manifolds. These are again subjects that go far beyond the scope of this
book. In general, the construction of Einstein metrics and the question of
their existence is a highly nontrivial problem in differential geonetry. The
study of this problem has a long history and there are many deep theorems
and interesting open questions about this subject.

This section introduces the Weyl tensor and explains some of its basic properties. The section closes with brief discussions of locally conformally flat
metrics and self-dual four-manifolds.

Also let S : M → R be the scalar curvature in Definition 6.7.1.

Lemma 6.8.2. The Weyl tensor Wp : Tp M × Tp M → End(Tp M ) at an element p ∈ M is a skew-symmetric bilinear map with values in the space of
skew-adjoint endomorphisms of Tp M and, for all u, v, w, z ∈ Tp M and every
orthonormal basis e1 , . . . , em of Tp M , it satisfies
⟨Wp (u, v)w, z⟩ = ⟨Wp (w, z)u, v⟩,

The verification of the Bianchi identity (6.8.3) is a straight forward computation which we leave as an exercise. To prove (6.8.4), let u, v ∈ Tp M and

Conformal Invariance
Definition 6.8.3 (Locally conformally flat metric). Let M be a Riemannian manifold. The metric g on M is called locally conformally flat,
iff for each p ∈ M there exists a Riemannian metric on M that is conformally equivalent to g (see Definition 6.7.4) and flat in a neighborhood of p.
By the local C-A-H Theorem 6.1.17 a Riemannian m-manifold M is locally conformally flat if and only if each p ∈ M has an open neighborhood U
that is conformally diffeomorphic to an open subset Ω ⊂ Rm , i.e. there
exists a coordinate chart ϕ : U → Ω and a smooth function λ : U → (0, ∞)
such that |v| = λ(p)|dϕ(p)v|Rm for all p ∈ U and all v ∈ Tp M .
A remarkable property of the Weyl tensor is that it remains unchanged
under multiplication of the Riemannian metric by a positive function and
so is an invariant of the conformal class of the metric. This is easy to see
when the function is constant. In that case the Riemann curvature tensor
and the Ricci tensor remain unchanged, the scalar curvature gets multiplied
by the inverse, and so the Weyl tensor remains unchanged. As Remark 6.7.5
shows, the situation is more complicated when instead of multiplying the
metric by a constant, we multiply it by a nonconstant positive function. The
conformal invariance of the Weyl tensor can then be proved by a somewhat
cumbersome calculation in local coordinates.

322

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Remark 6.8.4. This discussion shows that the Weyl tensor vanishes for
every Riemannian metric that is locally conformally flat. In fact, it turns
out that in dimension m ≥ 4 the Weyl tensor of M vanishes if and only if
the Riemannian metric on M is locally conformally flat (see [43]). Moreover, a theorem of Kuiper [33, 42] asserts that every compact, connected,
simply connected Riemannian m-manifold that is locally conformally flat is
conformally diffeomorphic to the m-sphere with its constant sectional curvature metric. Thus every compact, connected, simply connected Riemannian
manifold of dimension m ≥ 4 that is not diffeomorphic to S m must have a
nonvanishing Weyl tensor.

Self-Dual Four-Manifolds
The lowest dimension in which the study of the Weyl tensor is interesting
is m = 4. To explain this, it is useful to consider the notion of an oriented
manifold.
Definition 6.8.5 (Orientation). An orientation of an m-manifold M is
a collection of orientations of the tangent spaces Tp M , one for each p ∈ M ,
that depend continuously on p, i.e. if E1 , . . . , Em are pointwise linearly independent vector fields in a connected open neighborhood U ⊂ M of p and the
vectors E1 (p), . . . , Em (p) form a positive basis of Tp M , then for every q ∈ U
the vectors E1 (q), . . . , Em (q) form a positive basis of Tq M . In the intrinsic
language an oriented manifold is one equipped with an atlas such that all the
transition maps are orientation preserving diffeomorphisms.
Definition 6.8.6 (2-Form). Let M be a smooth manifold. A 2-form on M
is a collection of skew-symmetric bilinear maps ωp : Tp M × Tp M → R, one
for each p ∈ M , which is smooth in the sense that for every pair of smooth
vector fields X, Y on M the assignment p 7→ ωp (X(p), Y (p)) defines a smooth
function on M . The space of all 2-forms on M is denoted by Ω2 (M ).
In the similar vein the Weyl tensor of a Riemannian m-manifold M can
be thought of as 2-form with values in the endomorphism bundle End(T M ).
By the symmetry properties in Lemma 6.8.2 the Weyl tensor induces a linear
map W : Ω2 (M ) → Ω2 (M ) via the formula
X
(Wω)p (u, v) :=
⟨Wp (u, v)ei , ej ⟩ωp (ei , ej )
(6.8.6)
1≤i<j≤m

for ω ∈ Ω2 (M ), p ∈ M , and u, v ∈ Tp M , where e1 , . . . , em is an orthonormal
basis of Tp M . The right hand side of equation (6.8.6) is independent of the
choice of this orthonormal basis and is a 2-form by Lemma 6.8.2.

6.8. THE WEYL TENSOR*

323

Now let M be an oriented Riemannian 4-manifold. Then a 2-form ω
on M is called self-dual iff it satisfies the condition
ωp (e0 , e1 ) = ωp (e2 , e3 )

(6.8.7)

for every p ∈ M and every positive orthonormal basis e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 of Tp M . It
is called anti-self-dual iff it satisfies (6.8.7) for every p ∈ M and every negative orthonormal basis e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 of Tp M . Thus ω is anti-self-dual if and
only if it is self-dual for the opposite orientation. Denote the space of selfdual 2-forms by Ω2,+ (M ) and the space of anti-self-dual 2-forms by Ω2,− (M ).
Then there is a direct sum decomposition
Ω2 (M ) = Ω2,+ (M ) ⊕ Ω2,− (M ).
Lemma 6.8.7. Let M be an oriented Riemannian 4-manifold. Then the
linear operator W : Ω2 (M ) → Ω2 (M ) in (6.8.6) preserves the subspace of
self-dual 2-forms and the subspace of anti-self-dual 2-forms.
Proof. Fix any orthonormal basis e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 of Tp M and abbreviate
wijkℓ := ⟨Wp (ei , ej )ek , eℓ ⟩
for i, j, k, ℓ ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}. Then by Lemma 6.8.2 we have
wijkℓ = −wjikℓ = −wijℓk = wkℓij ,

wijkℓ + wjkiℓ + wkijℓ = 0,

w0ij0 + w1ij1 + w2ij2 + w3ij3 = 0

(6.8.8)
(6.8.9)

for all i, j, k, ℓ. It follows from (6.8.8) and (6.8.9) that
w0102 = w2331 ,

w0103 = w2312 ,

w0203 = w3112 ,

w2302 = w0131 ,

w2303 = w0112 ,

w3103 = w0212 .

(6.8.10)

Namely, by P
(6.8.8) each of these six identities is equivalent to an equation
of the form 3i=0 wijki = 0 with j ̸= k and this holds by (6.8.9). Use (6.8.8)
and (6.8.9) again to obtain
w0101 − w2323 − w0202 + w3131
= w0220 + w1221 + w3223 − w0110 − w2112 − w3113
=0
and hence, by cyclic permutation of 1, 2, 3,
ε := w0101 − w2323 = w0202 − w3131 = w0303 − w1212 .

324

CHAPTER 6. GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY

Since w0101 + w0202 + w0303 = 0 by (6.8.9), this implies
3ε = w1221 + w2332 + w1331 = w1221 − w0330 = w0303 − w1212 = ε.
Thus ε = 0 and so
w0101 = w2323 ,

w0202 = w3131 ,

w0303 = w1212 .

(6.8.11)

Now assume that τ is a nonzero self-dual 2-form and fix an element p ∈ M .
Then there exists a positive orthonormal basis e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 of Tp M and a
real number λ ̸= 0 such that τ (e0 , e1 ) = τ (e2 , e3 ) = λ and τ (ei , ej ) = 0
for all other pairs i, j. Hence (Wτ )(ei , ej ) = λw01ij + λw23ij for all i and j.
Take λ = 1 and use the equations (6.8.8), (6.8.10), and (6.8.11) to obtain
(Wτ )(e0 , e1 ) = w0101 + w2301 = w0123 + w2323 = (Wτ )(e2 , e3 ),
(Wτ )(e0 , e2 ) = w0102 + w2302 = w0131 + w2331 = (Wτ )(e3 , e1 ),
(Wτ )(e0 , e3 ) = w0103 + w2303 = w0112 + w2312 = (Wτ )(e1 , e2 ).
Thus Wτ is self-dual. The anti-self-dual case follows by reversing the orientation. This proves Lemma 6.8.7.
Lemma 6.8.8. Let M be an oriented Riemannian 4-manifold and denote
by W : Ω2 (M ) → Ω2 (M ) the linear operator determined by the Weyl tensor
via (6.8.6). Then the following are equivalent.
(i) If τ ∈ Ω2 (M ) is anti-self-dual, then Wτ = 0.
(ii) The Weyl tensor W satisfies satisfies the equation
Wp (e0 , e1 ) = Wp (e2 , e3 )

(6.8.12)

for every p ∈ M and every positive orthonormal basis e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 of Tp M .
Proof. We prove that (i) implies (ii). Thus assume (i) and choose a positive
orthonormal basis e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 of Tp M . Let τ be the 2-form defined by
τ (e0 , e1 ) := 1,

τ (e2 , e3 ) := −1

and τ (ei , ej ) := 0 for all other pairs i, j. Then τ is anti-self-dual and
hence Wτ = 0 by (i). Thus it follows from (6.8.2) and (6.8.6) that
⟨W (e0 , e1 )u − W (e2 , e3 )u, v⟩ = (Wτ )(u, v) = 0
for all u, v ∈ Tp M and this proves (ii).

6.8. THE WEYL TENSOR*

325

Conversely, suppose that (ii) holds, choose a positive orthonormal basis e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 of Tp M , and let τ be an anti-self-dual 2-form. Then
λ1 := τ (e0 , e1 ) = −τ (e2 , e3 ),
λ2 := τ (e0 , e2 ) = −τ (e3 , e1 ),
λ3 := τ (e0 , e3 ) = −τ (e1 , e2 )
and hence
Wτ = λ1 ⟨(W (e0 , e1 ) − W (e2 , e3 ))·, ·⟩
+ λ2 ⟨(W (e0 , e2 ) − W (e3 , e1 ))·, ·⟩
+ λ3 ⟨(W (e0 , e3 ) − W (e1 , e2 ))·, ·⟩ = 0
by (ii). This proves Lemma 6.8.8.
Definition 6.8.9. An oriented Riemannian 4-manifold is called self-dual
iff its Weyl tensor satisfies the equivalent conditions of Lemma 6.8.8. It is
called anti-self-dual iff it is self-dual for the opposite orientation.
Examples of self-dual 4-manifolds are all 4-manifolds with constant sectional curvature by Theorem 6.4.8, or more generally all locally conformally
flat 4-manifolds such as S 1 × S 3 . Other examples are the complex projective plane with its Fubini–Study metric (Examples 2.8.5 and 3.7.5), and
Ricci flat Kähler surfaces with the opposite of the complex orientation (the
K3-surface and the Enriques surface). Compact simply connected smooth
4-manifolds with signature zero that are not diffeomorphic to the 4-sphere,
such as S 2 × S 2 or the one-point blowup of the projective plane, do not
admit any self-dual metrics by Kuiper’s theorem (Remark 6.8.4), because
every self-dual metric on such a manifold is locally conformally flat. For a
survey of these basic examples see Kalafat [34].
The study of self-dual 4-manifolds was initiated by Penrose [56] and
Atiyah–Hitchin–Singer [4] and was later taken up by many authors including
Taubes [73], LeBrun [45], and Donaldson [18].
In [18] Donaldson proposes to study the moduli space of self-dual metrics
on a compact oriented smooth 4-manifold (without boundary) modulo the
action of the group of diffeomorphisms. This is a very difficult problem. The
self-duality equation is a system of nonlinear partial differential equations
and they do give rise to a “finite-dimensional moduli space”. However, this
space may be highly singular and it is noncompact unless it is empty. It
would need to be “compactified” in a suitable way, one would need to find
a way to understand the singularities, and one would have to assign to it
some kind of “virtual fundamental class” to obtain numerical invariants by
pairing this class with suitable cohomology classes in the ambient space.

Topics in Geometry
This chapter explores various topics in differential geometry that are central to the subject and accessible with the material covered in this book,
but go beyond the scope of a one semester lecture course. The first section builds on the material in Chapter 4 about geodesics and can be read
directly after that chapter. It introduces conjugate points on geodesics and
proves the Morse Index Theorem. This result is then used to show that every
geodesic without conjugate points minimizes the length locally (and strictly)
in the space of all curves joining the same endpoints and, conversely, that
locally minimizing geodesics have no interior conjugate points (§7.1). This
result in turn plays an essential role in the proof of the Continuity Theorem
for the injectivity radius (§7.2). The next section examines the group of
isometries of a connected Riemannian manifold and contains a proof of the
Myers–Steenrod Theorem, which asserts that the isometry group admits the
natural structure of a finite–dimensional Lie group (§7.3). The proof given
here has several parallels to the proof of the Closed Subgroup Theorem.
This section is based on the study of isometries and the Riemann curvature tensor in Chapter 5 and can be read directly after that chapter. The
present chapter then deals with the specific example of the isometry group
of a compact connected Lie group equipped with a bi-invariant Riemannian
metric (§7.4). The last two sections are devoted to Donaldson’s differential
geometric approach to Lie algebra theory [17]. They build on the material in
Chapter 6 and include Donaldson’s existence theorems for critical points of
convex functions on Hadamard manifolds (§7.5) and his existence proof for
symmetric inner products on simple Lie algebras (§7.6). Corollaries include
the uniqueness of maximal compact subgroups, and Cartan’s theorem about
the compact real form of a semisimple complex Lie algebra.

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Conjugate Points and the Morse Index*

This section introduces conjugate points on geodesics and contains a proof
of the Morse Index Theorem. As an application we prove that every geodesic
without conjugate points minimizes the length and the energy locally (and
strictly) among all nearby curves joining the same endpoints. Conversely,
locally minimizing geodesics have no interior conjugate points. The results
of this section will be used in §7.2 to prove the Continuity Theorem for the
injectivity radius. Assume throughout that M ⊂ Rn is a smooth m-manifold
and recall the notation Ωp,q for the space of all smooth paths γ : [0, 1] → M
with the endpoints γ(0) = p and γ(1) = q (§4.1.2).

Conjugate Points
We have seen in Theorem 4.4.4 and Corollary 4.4.6 that geodesics minimize
the length on short time intervals. A natural question arising from this
observation is how long the time interval can be chosen on which a geodesic
minimizes the length at least locally in some neighborhood in the space of
paths. An answer to this question is closely related to the Hessian of the
energy functional E : Ωp,q → R in (4.1.2). It was established in Lemma 6.6.3
that the Hessian of the energy functional E at a geodesic γ : [0, 1] → M is
the linear operator Hγ : Vect0 (γ) → Vect(γ) defined by
Hγ X := −∇∇X − R(X, γ̇)γ̇.

(7.1.1)

The domain of this operator is the space Vect0 (γ) of all vector fields X
along γ that vanish at the endoints, i.e. X(0) = 0 and X(1) = 0. Recall
that a Jacobi field along a geodesic is a solution of the equation
∇∇X + R(X, γ̇)γ̇ = 0,

(7.1.2)

and so the kernel of Hγ is the space of Jacobi fields along γ that vanish at
the endpoints (Lemma 6.1.18).
Definition 7.1.1. Let γ : [a, b] → M be a geodesic. A conjugate point
is a real number τ in the interval a < τ ≤ b such that there exists a nonvanishing Jacobi field X along the restriction γ|[a,τ ] that satisfies X(a) = 0
and X(τ ) = 0. The dimension of the space of solutions of this equation is
called the multiplicity of the conjugate point τ and will be denoted by


∇∇X + R(X, γ̇)γ̇ = 0,
mγ (τ ) := dim X ∈ Vect(γ|[a,τ ] )
.
(7.1.3)
X(a) = 0, X(τ ) = 0
Thus mγ (τ ) = 0 whenever τ is not a conjugate point of γ.

7.1. CONJUGATE POINTS AND THE MORSE INDEX*

329

In §4.4 we have addressed the question when a geodesic γ : [0, 1] → M
with the endpoints γ(0) = p and γ(1) = q minimizes the lengths of curves
with the same endpoints globally, i.e. when it satisfies L(γ) = d(p, q). A
weaker variant of this question is whether it minimizes the length locally,
i.e. only among nearby curves in Ωp,q . Here the word “nearby” can have
several meanings, depending on which topology on the space Ωp,q is used.
The relevant topologies in the present setting are the C 1 topology and the
C ∞ topology. Since our manifold M is embedded in Rn these topologies are
induced by the distance functions defined by
dC 1 (γ, γ ′ ) := sup |γ(t) − γ ′ (t)| + sup |γ̇(t) − γ̇ ′ (t)|,
dC ∞ (γ, γ ′ ) :=

for γ, γ ′ ∈ Ωp,q . Note that, if γ ∈ Ωp,q satisfies mint |γ̇(t)| > 0, then so does
every curve γ ′ in a sufficiently small C 1 -neighborhood of γ in Ωp,q .
Theorem 7.1.2. Let γ : [0, 1] → M be a nonconstant geodesic with the endpoints γ(0) = p and γ(1) = q. Then the following holds.
(i) If there exists a C ∞ -open neigborhood U ⊂ Ωp,q of γ such that every
curve γ ′ ∈ U satisfies L(γ ′ ) ≥ L(γ), then γ has no conjugate points τ in the
open interval 0 < τ < 1.
(ii) If γ has no conjugate points τ in the interval 0 < τ ≤ 1, then there exists a C 1 -open neighborhood U ⊂ Ωp,q of γ such that every curve γ ′ ∈ U
satisfies L(γ ′ ) ≥ L(γ) with equality if and only if there exists a diffeomorphism ρ : [0.1] → [0, 1] such that ρ(0) = 0, ρ(1) = 1, and γ ′ = γ ◦ ρ.
The proof will be based on the Morse Index Theorem explained below.
Example 7.1.3. The archetypal example of a conjugate point is the endpoint of a geodesic γ : [0, 1] → S 2 on the unit sphere S 2 ⊂ R3 of length π.
This is the endpoint of an arc around half of a great circle, and at this point
the geodesic seizes to be locally unique as there is a continuous family of
geodesics joining north and south pole (the meridians).
Example 7.1.4. The absence of conjugate points does not signify that a
geodesic γ ∈ Ωp,q minimizes the length globally. The sinplest example is
a geodesic around the unit circle M = S 1 of length L(γ) > π. Similar
examples exist on the torus M = Tm , on the cylinder M = R × S 1 , and
also on simply connected manifolds such as the sphere S 2 with a suitably
chosen Riemannian metric (so that an open subset U ⊂ S 2 is isometric to a
cylinder (0, 1) × S 1 , for example).

This is also the number of negative eigenvalues, counted with multiplicities,
of the operator Hγ in (7.1.1).
Theorem 7.1.6 (Morse Index Theorem). Let γ : [0, 1] → M be a

Remark 7.1.9 (Properties of Hγ ). We begin with the properties that
can be easily verified directly, without an appeal to Hilbert space theory.
(a) Each eigenvalue of Hγ is a real number.
This assertion is a consequence of the fact that the operator Hγ is symmetric,
i.e. ⟨Hγ X, Y ⟩L2 = ⟨X, Hγ Y ⟩L2 for all X, Y ∈ Vect0 (γ). (Exercise: Verify
assertion (a) by complexifying the space of vector fields along γ.)
(b) Each eigenvalue of Hγ has multiplicity at most m.
The eigenspace of Hγ for an eigenvalue λ consists of solutions of the equation −∇∇X − R(X, γ̇) = λX with X(0) = 0. Every solution is uniquely
determined by ∇X(0) and is an eigenfunction for λ if and only if X(1) = 0.
(c) Every X ∈ Vect0 (γ) satisfies the Poincaré inequality

This follows directly from the Poincaré inequality in (c).
(e) Let λ be an eigenvalue of Hγ . Then λ ≥ π 2 − cγ .
There exists a nonzero element X ∈ Vect0 (γ) such that Hγ X = λX. By (d)
this implies λ ∥X∥2L2 = ⟨X, Hγ X⟩L2 ≥ (π 2 − cγ ) ∥X∥2L2 and so λ ≥ π 2 − cγ .
(f ) The set σ(Hγ ) of eigenvalues of Hγ is a discrete subset of R.
Let λ ∈ σ(Hγ ) and let Πλ be the orthogonal projection onto the eigenspace
of λ. Then the operator Hγ − λid + Πλ : Vect0 (γ) → Vect(γ) is bijective,
and hence so is the operator Hγ −λ′ id+Πλ for λ′ sufficently close to λ. Such
a number λ′ cannot be an eigenvalue of Hγ . This argument uses the fact
that Hγ is a Fredholm operator between appropriate Sobolev completions.

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

To prove this, define a ∈ R to be the infimum of the integrals on the left
in (7.1.9) over all X ∈ Vect0 (γ) with ∥X∥L2 = 1. This infimum is finite
by (d). Now choose a minimizing sequence Xi ∈ Vect0 (γ) with ∥Xi ∥L2 = 1.
This sequence satisfies a uniform upper bound on ∥∇Xi ∥L2 . Hence, by the
theorems of Banach–Alaoglu and Arzelà-Ascoli, there exists a subsequence
that converges weakly in the Sobolev space W 1,2 and strongly in the supremum norm to a weak solution of the equation −∇∇X − R(X, γ̇)γ̇ = aX
with zero boundary condition. Now one can verify by a bootstrapping argument that every weak solution is smooth. Hence (7.1.9) holds, a is an
eigenvalue of Hγ , and every eigenvalue λ of Hγ satisfies λ ≥ a.
(h) The Morse index of γ is finite.
The operator Hγ has only finitely many negative eigenvalues by (e) and (f),
and the direct sum Xγ of their eigenspaces is finite-dimensional by (b). Moreover, every nonzero element X ∈ Xγ satisfies the inequality ⟨X, Hγ X⟩L2 < 0.
One can then repeat the argument sketched in (g) for the L2 orthogonal
complement of Xγ to show that ⟨X, Hγ X⟩L2 ≥ 0 for all X ∈ Xγ⊥ . Hence the
dimension of Xγ is the Morse index of γ (Definition 7.1.5).
Proof of Theorem 7.1.6. Choose a parallel orthonormal frame
E1 (t), . . . , Em (t) ∈ Tγ(t) M
and, for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, define the symmetric matrix S(t) = S(t)T ∈ Rm×m by
S(t) := (Sij (t))m
i,j=1 ,

Sij (t) := ⟨R(Ei (t), γ̇(t))γ̇(t), Ej (t)⟩,

Let I := [0, 1] and define the operator A : C0∞ (I, Rm ) → C ∞ (I.Rm ) with
the domain C0∞ (I, Rm ) := {ξ ∈ C ∞ (I, Rm ) | ξ(0) = ξ(1) = 0} , by
Aξ := −ξ¨ − Sξ.
This operator is isomorphic to the
P operator (7.1.1) via the isomorphism that
∞
m
sends ξ ∈ C0 (I, R ) to X := i ξi Ei ∈ Vect0 (γ). Now define a family of
operators Aτ : C0∞ (I, Rm ) → C ∞ (I.Rm ) by
1 ¨
(Aτ ξ)(t) := − 2 ξ(t)
− S(τ t)ξ(t)
τ
for 0 < τ ≤ 1. Then Aτ is isomorphic to the operator (7.1.1) on the interval [0, τ ] via
that sends ξ ∈ C0∞ (I, Rm ) to the vector
Pthe isomorphism
−1
field X(t) := i ξ(τ t)Ei (t) ∈ Tγ(t) M , 0 ≤ t ≤ τ , along the curve γ|[0,τ ] .
Thus τ is a conjugate point of γ if and only if Aτ has a nontrivial kernel,
and the dimension of the kernel is the multiplicity mγ (τ ).

This proves (7.1.10). Note also that Γτ (ξ) < 0 unless ξ(t) = 0 for all t.
With this understood, we appeal to the Kato Selection Theorem [35,
Theorem II.5.4 and Theorem II.6.8]. It asserts in the case at hand that,
near each point τ0 with k := dim(ker(Aτ0 )) > 0, there exist k continuously
differentiable functions λi : (τ0 − ε, τ0 + ε) → R such that λi (τ0 ) = 0, the
numbers λ1 (τ ), . . . , λk (τ ) are the eigenvalues of Aτ near zero, with multiplicities accounted for by repetitions, and the derivatives λ̇i (τ0 ) are the
eigenvalues of the crossing form Γτ0 : ker Aτ0 → R in (7.1.10), again with
multiplicities accounted for by repetitions. The derivatives are all negative
by (7.1.10). Hence there exists a δ > 0 such that λi (τ ) > 0 for τ0 −δ < τ < τ0
and λi (τ ) < 0 for τ0 < τ < τ0 + δ. Hence conjugate points are isolated, and
for τ0 < τ < τ0 + δ the operator Aτ has precisely k more negative eigenvalues
than for τ0 − δ < τ <P
τ0 . Hence the number of the negative eigenvalues of A1
with multiplicities is 0<τ <1 dim(ker(Aτ )). This proves Theorem 7.1.6.
For more detailed explanations and other closely related applications of
the Kato Selection Theorem the reader is referred to [61, 76].

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Locally Minimal Geodesics
Proof of Theorem 7.1.2. We prove part (i). Let X ∈ Vect0 (M ) and define
γs (t) := expγ(t) (sX(t))
for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 and −δ < s < δ. Here δ > 0 is chosen so small that sX(t)
is contained in the domain Vγ(t) ⊂ Tγ(t) M of the exponential map for all t
and all s with |s| < δ. Then lims→0 dC ∞ (γ, γs ) = 0 and so γs ∈ U for s
sufficiently small. Hence the function (−δ, δ) → R : s 7→ L(γs ) has a local
minimum at s = 0, and since E(γ) = L(γ)2 /2 and L(γs )2 /2 ≤ E(γs ), so
does the function s 7→ E(γs ). By Lemma 6.6.3 this implies

This inequality shows that the operator Hγ has no negative eigenvalues.
Hence, by Theorem 7.1.6 the geodesic γ has no conjugate points τ in the
interval 0 < τ < 1. This proves (i).
We prove part (ii) in six steps. Let γ ∈ Ωp,q be a nonconstant geodesic
without conjugate points.
Step 1. There exist constants δ1 > 0 and ε > 0 such that

By Theorem 7.1.6 the Hessian Hγ has no negative eigenvalues and, since 1
is not a conjugate point of γ, also zero is not an eigenvalue of Hγ . Hence
the smallest eigenvalue of Hγ is positive and so, by part (e) of Remark 7.1.9,
the estimate (7.1.9) holds for all X ∈ Vect0 (γ) with a positive constant a. If
the constant b > 0 is chosen such that ⟨R(v, γ̇(t))γ̇(t), v⟩ ≤ b|v|2 for all t and
all v ∈ Tγ(t) M , we obtain the estimate (7.1.11) for γ ′ = γ and X ∈ Vect0 (γ)
with ε := a/(a + b + 1). (Exercise: Verify this.) In a local coordinat chart
on M the integrand on the left in (7.1.11) has the form

where c(t) := ϕ(γ ′ (t)) and ξ(t) = dϕ(γ ′ (t))X(t) (and the coefficients gij , Γkij ,
and Rijkℓ are functions of c(t)). This expression depends continuously on the
curve c and its derivative ċ. Hence there exists a constant δ1 > 0 such that
every curve γ ′ ∈ Ωp,q with dC 1 (γ, γ ′ ) < δ1 and every X ∈ Vect0 (γ ′ ) satisfies
the estimate (7.1.11) with ε = a/2(a + b + 1). This proves Step 1.

Step 2. Let δ1 > 0 be as in Step 1. Then there exists a constant δ2 > 0 with
the following significance. If Y ∈ Vect0 (γ) satisfies


sup |Y (t)| + |∇Y (t)| < δ2 ,
(7.1.12)
0≤t≤1

then the curve γ ′ := expγ (Y ) ∈ Ωp,q satisfies dC 1 (γ, γ ′ ) < δ1 .
For 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 define the map ft : Vγ(t) × Tγ(t) M → T M by


ft (v, vb) := exp(γ(t), v), d exp(γ(t), v) γ̇(t), vb + hγ(t) (γ̇(t), v)

(7.1.13)

for v ∈ Vγ(t)
 and vb ∈ Tγ(t) M . By Lemma 4.3.6 the map (t, v, vb) 7→ ft (v, vb)
from U := (t, v, vb) | 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, v ∈ Vγ(t) , vb ∈ Tγ(t) M to T M is smooth and
satisfies ft (0, 0) = (γ(t), γ̇(t)). Thus there exist constants r1 > 0 and C1 ≥ 1
such that all t and all v, vb ∈ Tγ(t) M with |v| + |b

(7.1.14)
Choose Y ∈ Vect0 (γ) such that |Y (t)| + |∇Y (t)| ≤ r1 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 and
define γ ′ (t) := expγ(t) (Y (t)). Then it follows from the Gauß–Weingarten
formula in Lemma 3.2.3 that (γ ′ (t), γ̇ ′ (t)) = ft (Y (t), ∇Y (t)) for all t. Hence
the estimate (7.1.14) shows that Step 2 holds with δ2 := min{r1 , δ1 /C1 }.
Step 3 Let δ2 > 0 be as in Step 2. Then there exists a constant δ3 > 0 with
the following significance. If γ ′ ∈ Ωp,q satisfies the inequality dC 1 (γ, γ ′ ) < δ3 ,
then there exists a unique vector field Y ∈ Vect0 (γ) satisfying (7.1.12) and
|Y (t)| < inj(γ(t); M ),

γ ′ (t) = expγ(t) (Y (t))

(7.1.15)

for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
Define ρ := inf 0≤t≤1 inj(γ(t); M ) > 0 and let ft be the map in (7.1.13).
Its derivative at the origin is given by dft (0, 0)(η, ηb) = (η, ηb + hγ(t) (γ̇(t), η))
and so is invertible. Hence, by the implicit function theorem, there exist
constants r2 > 0 and C2 ≥ 1 such that, for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, the set

Qt := (p, pb) ∈ T M |p − γ(t)| + |b
p − γ̇(t)| ≤ r2
is compact, ft restricts to a diffeomorphism from a compact neighborhood
of the origin in Bρ (γ(t)) × Tγ(t) M to Qt , and every pair (p, pb) ∈ Qt satisfies

|v| + |b
v | ≤ C2 |p − γ(t)| + |b

(v, vb) := ft−1 (p, pb). (7.1.16)
Choose γ ′ ∈ Ωp,q such that dC 1 (γ, γ ′ ) ≤ r2 . Then (γ ′ (t), γ̇ ′ (t)) ∈ Qt for all t
and hence there exists a unique vector field Y ∈ Vect0 (γ) satisfying (7.1.15).
By (7.1.13) it also satisfies (Y (t), ∇Y (t)) = ft−1 (γ ′ (t), γ̇ ′ (t)) for all t. Hence
the estimate (7.1.16) shows that Step 3 holds with δ3 := min{r2 , δ2 /C2 }.

Step 4. Let δ3 be as in Step 3. Then there exists a constant δ4 > 0 with
the following significance. If γ ′ ∈ Ωp,q satisfies dC 1 (γ, γ ′ ) < δ4 , then the
Rt
map ρ : [0, 1] → [0, 1] defined by ρ(t) := L(γ ′ )−1 0 |γ̇ ′ (s)| ds for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 is
a diffeomorphism and dC 1 (γ, γ ′ ◦ ρ−1 ) < δ3 .
Define c := L(γ) and C := supt |γ̈(t)|. Then c > 0 because γ is nonconstant.
We claim that Step 4 holds for every constant δ4 > 0 that satisfies

it satisfies |γ̇(t)| = L(γ) = c. Hence ||γ̇ ′ (t)| − c| < δ4 for all t. Since δ4 < c
by (7.1.17), this implies that ρ is a diffeomorphism. It also implies the length

Step 5. Let δ3 > 0 be as in Step 3 and let γ ′ ∈ Ωp,q such that dC 1 (γ, γ ′ ) < δ3 .
Then E(γ ′ ) ≥ E(γ) with equality if and only if γ ′ = γ.
Assume γ ′ ̸= γ. By Step 3 there exists a nonzero vector field Y ∈ Vect0 (γ)
satisfying (7.1.12), (7.1.15), and γ ′ = expγ (Y ). For 0 ≤ s, t ≤ 1 define
γs (t) := expγ(t) (sY (t)).
Then γ0 = γ, γ1 = γ ′ , and Step 2 asserts that
dC 1 (γ, γs ) < δ1

for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1.

follows from Step 1 and the fact that ∂s γs = d expγ (sY )Y is a nonzero vector
field along γs . Thus the curve [0, 1] → R : s 7→ E(γs ) is strictly convex. Since
its derivative vanishes at s = 0, it follows that E(γs ) > E(γ) for 0 < s ≤ 1.
Since γ1 = γ ′ , this proves Step 5.
Step 6. Let δ4 be as in Step 4. Then the C 1 -open set

U := γ ′ ∈ Ωp,q dC 1 (γ, γ ′ ) < δ4
satisfies the requirements of part (ii) in Theorem 7.1.2.
Let γ ′ ∈ U and define the diffeomorphism ρ : [0, 1] → [0, 1] as in Step 4.
Then, by Step 4 we have dC 1 (γ, γ ′ ◦ ρ−1 ) < δ3 and hence, by Step 5 this
implies E(γ ′ ◦ ρ−1 ) ≥ E(γ) with equality if and only if γ ′ ◦ ρ−1 = γ. Since γ
and γ ′ ◦ ρ−1 are parametrized by the arclength, we find that
p
p
L(γ ′ ) = L(γ ′ ◦ ρ−1 ) = 2E(γ ′ ◦ ρ−1 ) ≥ 2E(γ) = L(γ),
and that equality holds if and only if γ ′ ◦ ρ−1 = γ. Thus every curve γ ′ ∈ U
that arises from γ by reparametrization has the same length as γ and every
other curve in U is strictly longer. This proves Step 6 and Theorem 7.1.2.
We remark that there is a precise analogy between Theorem 7.1.2 about
geodesics (extrema of the energy functional E) and extrema of a function
f : Rn → R
on a finite-dimensional vector space. If the function f has a local minimum
at a point x0 ∈ Rn , then the Hessian of f at x0 has no negative eigenvalues
and, conversely, if x0 is a critical point of f and all the eigenvalues of the
Hessian at x0 are positive, then x0 is a strict local minimum of f .

The Injectivity Radius*

Assume throughout that M ⊂ Rn is a smooth m-manifold. In this section
we prove that the function which assigns to each point p ∈ M its injectivity
radius inj(p; M ) ∈ (0, ∞] is continuous. Recall the concept of a local diffeomorphism as a smooth map between manifolds of the same dimension whose
derivative at each point is a vector space isomorphism (Definition 2.2.20).
Recall also the notation Vp ⊂ Tp M for the domain of the exponential map
at p and the notation Br (p) = {v ∈ Tp M | |v| < r} for p ∈ M and r > 0.
Theorem 7.2.1. The function M → (0, ∞] : p 7→ inj(p; M ) is continuous.
The proof of Theorem 7.2.1 is based on two lemmas.
Lemma 7.2.2. The set Ur := {p ∈ M | r < inj(p; M )} is open for each real
number r > 0.
Proof. Let r > 0 and p0 ∈ Ur . We prove in three steps that there exists
a δ > 0 such that r + δ ≤ inj(p; M ) for every p ∈ M with d(p, p0 ) < δ.
Step 1. There exists a δ > 0 such that Br+δ (p) ⊂ Vp for every p ∈ M
with d(p, p0 ) < δ.
Suppose, by contradiction, that such a constant δ does not exist. Then
there exist sequences pi ∈ M and vi ∈ Tpi M \ Vi such that d(pi , p0 ) < 1/i
and |vi | < r + 1/i. Passing to a subsequence, if necessary, we may assume
that vi converges to a vector v0 ∈ Tp0 M . Then |v0 | ≤ r and so (p0 , v0 ) ∈ V .
Since (pi , vi ) ∈ T M \ V converges to (p0 , v0 ), this contradicts the fact that V
is open. This proves Step 1.
Step 2. There exists a δ > 0 such that the map expp : Br+δ (p) → M is a
local diffeomorphism for every p ∈ M with d(p, p0 ) < δ.
Suppose, by contradiction, that such a constant δ does not exist. Then
there exist sequences pi ∈ M and vi ∈ Tpi M such that d(pi , p0 ) < 1/i and
|vi | < r + 1/i, and the derivative d exppi (vi ) : Tpi M → Texpp (vi ) M is not
i
injective. Passing to a subsequence, if necessary, we may assume that vi
converges to a vector v0 ∈ Tp0 M . Then, by smoothness of the exponential
map, the derivative
d expp0 (v0 ) : Tp0 M → Texpp (v0 ) M
0

is not injective. Since |v0 | ≤ r, this contradicts the fact that r < inj(p0 ; M ).
This proves Step 2.

7.2. THE INJECTIVITY RADIUS*

339

Step 3. There exists a δ > 0 such that the map expp : Br+δ (p) → M is
injective for every p ∈ M with d(p, p0 ) < δ.
Suppose, by contradiction, that such a constant δ does not exist. Then there
exist sequences pi ∈ M and ui , vi ∈ Tpi M such that
|ui | < r + 1/i,

d(pi , p0 ) < 1/i,

|vi | < r + 1/i

and
ui ̸= vi ,

exppi (ui ) = exppi (vi ) =: qi .

Passing to a subsequence, if necessary, we may assume that the limits
u0 = lim ui ∈ Tp0 M,

v0 := lim vi ∈ Tp0 M

i→∞

i→∞

exist. These limits satisfy
|u0 | ≤ r,

|v0 | ≤ r,

expp0 (u0 ) = expp0 (v0 ).

Since r < inj(p0 ; M ), this implies u0 = v0 and hence
lim ui = lim vi = v0 .

i→∞

i→∞

Now define
wi :=

vi − ui
∈ Tpi M,
τi

τi := |vi − ui | > 0.

Passing to a further subsequence, we may assume that the limit
w0 := lim wi ∈ Tp0 M
i→∞

exists. Then |w0 | = 1 and hence

̸= 0.
This contradiction proves Step 3. Now choose a constant δ > 0 that satisfies
the requirements of Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3. Then, for every p ∈ M
with d(p, p0 ) < δ we have Br+δ (p) ⊂ Vp and the map expp : Br+δ (p) → M
is a diffeomorphism onto its image. Hence inj(p; M ) ≥ r + δ > r for every
element p ∈ M with d(p, p0 ) < δ, and this proves Lemma 7.2.2.

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Lemma 7.2.3. The set Ar := {p ∈ M | r ≤ inj(p; M )} is closed for each real
number r > 0 and hence also for r = ∞.
Proof. Let pi ∈ Ar be a sequence that converges to an element p ∈ M . We
prove in five steps that r ≤ inj(p; M ).
Step 1. Br (p) ⊂ Vp .
Choose a tangent vector v ∈ Tp M with |v| < r, choose a constant ε > 0 such
that |v| + ε < r, and choose an integer i such that d(p, pi ) ≤ ε. Define

K := exppi (B̄|v|+ε (pi )) = q ∈ M d(q, pi ) ≤ |v| + ε .
Here the second equality follows from Theorem 4.4.4 and the fact that
|v| + ε < r ≤ inj(pi ; M ). By definition, K is the image of a compact set
under a continuous map, and so is a compact subset of M . Hence

e := (q, w) ∈ T M d(q, pi ) ≤ |v| + ε, |w| = |v|
K
is a compact subset of T M . We claim that v ∈ Vp . Suppose, by contradiction, that this is not the case. Then Ip,v ∩ [0, ∞) = [0, T ) with 0 < T ≤ 1.
Denote by γ : [0, T ) → M the geodesic γ(t) := expp (tv). Then
d(γ(t), pi ) ≤ d(expp (tv), p) + d(p, pi ) ≤ |tv| + ε ≤ |v| + ε
e for 0 ≤ t < T . By Lemma 4.3.3
and |γ̇(t)| = |v|, and hence (γ(t), γ̇(t)) ∈ K
and Corollary 2.4.15, this implies that there exists a constant δ > 0 such
that [0, T + δ) ⊂ Ip,v , in contradiction to the definition of T . This contradiction shows that our assumption that v is not an element of Vp must have
been wrong. Thus v ∈ Vp and this proves Step 1.
Step 2. Let q ∈ M such that d(p, q) < r. Then there exists a vector v ∈ Tp M
such that |v| = d(p, q) and expp (v) = q.
Since pi converges to p, we have limi→∞ d(pi , q) = d(p, q) < r and so
there exists an integer i0 ∈ N such that d(pi , q) < r for all i ≥ i0 . Then,
for each i ≥ i0 , there exists a tangent vector vi ∈ Tpi M that satisfies the
conditions exppi (vi ) = q and |vi | = d(pi , q) < r (Theorem 4.4.4). Passing to
a subsequence, if necessary, we may assume that the limit v := limi→∞ vi
exists in Rn . Then v ∈ Tp M , |v| = limi→∞ |vi | = limi→∞ d(pi , q) = d(p, q),
so v ∈ Br (p) ⊂ Vp and expp (v) = limi→∞ exppi (vi ) = q. This proves Step 2.
Step 3. Let v ∈ Tp M such that |v| < r. Then d(p, expp (v)) = |v|.
Define q := expp (v), so d(p, q) ≤ |v| < r. Choose a sequence vi ∈ Tpi M such
that |vi | = |v| for all i and limi→∞ vi = v. Then the sequence qi := exppi (vi )
converges to q = expp (v) and satisfies d(pi , qi ) = |vi | by Theorem 4.4.4.
Hence d(p, q) = limi→∞ d(pi , qi ) = limi→∞ |vi | = |v| and this proves Step 3.

7.2. THE INJECTIVITY RADIUS*

Step 4. The map expp : Br (p) → M is a local diffeomorphism.
Let v ∈ Br (p) and let vb ∈ Tp M be a nonzero vector. Choose any real number 1 < λ < r/|v| so that |λv| < r and define the geodesic γ : [0, λ] → M and
the vector field X ∈ Vect(γ) by
γ(t) := expp (tv),

X(t) :=


∂
expp t(v + sb
v ) = d expp (tv)tb
v
∂s s=0

for 0 ≤ t ≤ λ. By Lemma 6.1.18, X is a Jacobi field along γ and
X(0) = 0,

∇X(0) = vb ̸= 0,

X(1) = d expp (v)b
v.

Since L(γ) = d(p, expp (λv)) = d(γ(0), γ(λ)) by Step 3, it follows from
part (i) of Theorem 7.1.2 that the geodesic γ : [0, λ] → M has no conjugate points τ in the open interval 0 < τ < λ. In particular, τ = 1 is not
a conjugate point, and so X(1) ̸= 0. Hence the derivative d expp (v) of the
exponential map is bijective at every point v ∈ Br (p) and this proves Step 4.
Step 5. The map expp : Br (p) → M is injective.
This is a covering argument. Let v0 , v1 ∈ Br (p) with expp (v0 ) = expp (v1 ),
choose a smooth path v : [0, 1] → Br (p) such that v(0) = v0 and v(1) = v1 ,
and define γ(t) := expp (v(t)) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, so γ(0) = γ(1) = q := expp (v0 ).
Choose ρ < r and i ∈ N such that |v(t)| < ρ for all t and d(pi , p) < r − ρ.
Then d(pi , γ(t)) ≤ d(pi , p) + d(p, γ(t)) < d(pi , p) + ρ < r for all t. Define


−1
0 ≤ s, t ≤ 1.
β(s, t) := exppi s exp−1
pi (q) + (1 − s) exppi (γ(t)) ,
This map takes values in the set Ur (p) = {p′ ∈ M | d(p, p′ ) < r} and satisfies
β(0, t) = γ(t) = expp (v(t)),

β(1, t) = q

for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1,

and β(s, 0) = β(s, 1) = q for all s. Since the map expp : Br (p) → Ur (p)
is surjective by Step 2 and a local diffeomorphism by Step 4, a path lifting
argument shows that there exists a smooth map u : [0, 1]2 → Br (p) such that
u(0, t) = v(t),

expp (u(s, t)) = β(s, t)

for 0 ≤ s, t ≤ 1. This map satisfies u(s, 0) = v0 and u(s, 1) = v1 for all s
and, moreover, the curve t 7→ u(1, t) must be constant. Hence v0 = v1 . This
proves Step 5 and Lemma 7.2.3.
Proof of Theorem 7.2.1. The set {p ∈ M | a < inj(p; M ) < b} = Ua \ Ab
is open for all nunbers 0 < a < b ≤ ∞ by Lemma 7.2.2 and Lemma 7.2.3.
Hence the function M → (0, ∞] : p 7→ inj(p; M ) is continuous.

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

The Group of Isometries*

This section is devoted to the Myers–Steenrod Theorem which asserts that
the group I(M ) of isometries of a connected smooth Riemannian manifold M admits the natural structure of a finite-dimensional Lie group [52].

7.3.1

The Myers–Steenrod Theorem

Assume throughout that M ⊂ Rn is a nonempty connected smooth mmanifold. To state the main result, it is convenient to introduce the space


p, q ∈ M and Φ : Tp M → Tq M
G := (q, Φ, p)
.
(7.3.1)
is an orthogonal isomorphism
This space is a groupoid, i.e. a category in which every morphism is an
isomorphism. The space of objects is the manifold M , the morphisms
from p ∈ M to q ∈ M are the triples of the form (q, Φ, p) ∈ G, the identity
morphism from p to itself is the triple (p, 1l, p), the inverse of (q, Φ, p) ∈ G is
the triple (p, Φ−1 , q), and the composition of a morphism (q, Φ, p) ∈ G from p
to q with a morphism (r, Ψ, q) ∈ G from q to r is the triple (r, ΨΦ, p).
The space G is a smooth manifold (in the intrinsic sense). To see this,
consider the diagonal action of the orthogonal group O(m) on the product of the orthonormal frame bundle O(M ) with itself (Definition 3.4.3).
This action is free and the map π : O(M ) × O(M ) → G which sends the
pair ((q, e′ ), (p, e)) to the triple (q, e′ ◦ e−1 , p) ∈ G descends to a bijection
from the quotient (O(M ) × O(M ))/O(m) to G. By Theorem 2.9.14 there is
a unique smooth structure on G such that the map π : O(M ) × O(M ) → G
is a submersion. With this structure the maps s, t : G → M defined by
s(q, Φ, p) := p,

t(q, Φ, p) := q

are smooth, the map e : M → G defined by
e(p) := (p, 1l, p)
is an embedding, the inverse map i : G → G defined by
i(q, Φ, p) := (p, Φ−1 , q)
is a smooth involution, the map s × t : G × G → M × M is a submersion,
and the composition map m : (s × t)−1 (∆) → G defined by
m((r, Ψ, q), (q, Φ, p)) := (r, ΨΦ, p)
is smooth. (Here ∆ := {(q, q) | q ∈ M } is the diagonal in M × M .) These
properties assert that the tuple (G, s, t, e, i, m) is a smooth groupoid.

(7.3.2)

This space is a submanifold of G because s : G → M is a submersion. The
space Gp is also a smooth submanifold of Rn × L(Tp M, Rn ) and is diffeomorphic to the orthonormal frame bundle O(M ) ⊂ Rn × Rn×m via the
map Gp → O(M ) : (q, Φ) 7→ (q, Φ ◦ e) for any orthonormal frame e of Tp M .
Since M is connected, Lemma 5.1.10 asserts that the map
ιp : I(M ) → Gp ,

ιp (ϕ) := (ϕ(p), dϕ(p)),

is injective for every p ∈ M . Denote the image of this map by

Ip := ιp (I(M )) = (ϕ(p), dϕ(p)) ϕ ∈ I(M ) ⊂ Gp .

(7.3.3)

(7.3.4)

In the following theorem we do not assume that M is complete. For a space
of smooth functions or maps on M we use the term C ∞ topology to mean
the topology of uniform convergence with all derivatives on each compact
subset of M . Likewise we use the term C 0 topology to mean the topology of
uniform convergence on each compact subset of M . The latter is also called
the compact-open topology (because a basis of the topology consists of
sets of maps, one for each compact subset of the source and each open subset
of the target, that send the given compact subset of the source into the given
open subset of the target).
Theorem 7.3.1 (Myers–Steenrod). Let M ⊂ Rn be a nonempty connected smooth m-manifold. Then the following holds.
(i) There exists a unique smooth structure on the isometry group I(M ) such
that the map ιp : I(M ) → Gp in (7.3.3) is an embedding for every p ∈ M .
The topology induced by this smooth structure agrees with the C 0 topology
and with the C ∞ topology on I(M ) and dim(I(M )) ≤ m(m + 1)/2.
(ii) With the smooth structure in part (i) the maps
I(M ) × I(M ) → I(M ) : (ψ, ϕ) 7→ ψ ◦ ϕ
and
I(M ) → I(M ) : ϕ 7→ ϕ−1
are smooth. Thus I(M ) is a finite-dimensional Lie group.
(iii) The Lie algebra of I(M ) is the space VectK,c (M ) of complete Killing
vector fields (defined below).
Proof. See §7.3.4.

7.3.2

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

The Topology on the Space of Isometries

The next lemma shows that for each p ∈ M the set Ip in (7.3.4) is a closed
subset of Gp and that the map ιp : I(M ) → Ip in (7.3.3) is a homeomorphism
with respect to the C ∞ topology on I(M ).
Lemma 7.3.2. Fix two elements p0 , q0 ∈ M , let Φ0 : Tp0 M → Tq0 M be an
orthogonal isomorphism, and let ϕi : M → M be a sequence of isometries.
Then the following are equivalent.
(i) The sequence ιp0 (ϕi ) ∈ Ip0 converges to the pair (q0 , Φ0 ) ∈ Gp0 , i.e.
lim ϕi (p0 ) = q0 ,

i→∞

lim dϕi (p0 ) = Φ0 .

i→∞

(7.3.5)

(ii) There exists an isometry ϕ : M → M such that ϕ(p0 ) = q0 , dϕ(p0 ) = Φ0 ,
and ϕi converges to ϕ in the C ∞ topology.
Proof. That (ii) implies (i) follows directly from the definitions. We prove in
three steps that (i) implies (ii). For p ∈ M and r > 0 denote by Vp ⊂ Tp M
the domain of the exponential map of M at p (Definition 4.3.5), and define Ur (p) := {q ∈ M | d(p, q) < r} and Br (p) := {v ∈ Tp M | |v| < r}.
Step 1. Assume (7.3.5) holds and choose a real number 0 < r ≤ inj(p0 ; M ).
Then r ≤ inj(q0 ; M ) and ϕi converges on the open set Ur (p0 ) in the C ∞
topology to the isometry ϕ0 := expq0 ◦ Φ0 ◦ exp−1
p0 : Ur (p0 ) → Ur (q0 ).
Since r ≤ inj(p0 ; M ), Corollary 5.3.3 asserts that
Br (ϕi (p0 )) = dϕi (p0 )Br (p0 ) ⊂ dϕi (p0 )Vp0 ⊂ Vϕi (p0 )
and ϕi ◦ expp0 = expϕi (p0 ) ◦ Φi : Br (p0 ) → Ur (ϕi (p0 )). Thus the map
expϕi (p0 ) = ϕi ◦ expp0 ◦ Φ−1
i : Br (ϕi (p0 )) → Ur (ϕi (p0 ))
is a diffeomorphism and so r ≤ inj(ϕi (p0 ); M ) for each i ∈ N. Since ϕi (p0 )
converges to q0 , this implies r ≤ inj(q0 ; M ) (Lemma 7.2.3). Hence the sequence of maps expϕi (p0 ) ◦ Φi converges to the map expq0 ◦ Φ0 in the C ∞
topology on Br (p0 ). Hence the sequence of isometries
ϕi = expϕi (p0 ) ◦ Φi ◦ exp−1
p0 : Ur (p0 ) → M
converges in the C ∞ topology to the diffeomorphism
ϕ0 := expq0 ◦ Φ0 ◦ exp−1
p0 : Ur (p0 ) → Ur (q0 ).

7.3. THE GROUP OF ISOMETRIES*

345

The map ϕ0 satisfies
d(ϕ0 (p), ϕ0 (q)) = lim d(ϕi (p), ϕi (q)) = d(p, q)
i→∞

for all p, q ∈ Ur (p0 ) and hence is an isometry (Theorem 5.1.1). This proves
Step 1.
Step 2. The sequence ϕi converges in the C ∞ topology on all of M to a
smooth map ϕ : M → M .
Define the set M0 := {p ∈ M | the sequence (ϕi (p), dϕi (p)) converges} . This
set is nonempty because p0 ∈ M0 . We prove that M0 is open. Fix any
element p ∈ M0 and define q := limi→∞ ϕi (p) and Φ := limi→∞ dϕi (p).
Choose a real number r such that 0 < r < inj(p; M ). Then Step 1 asserts that r ≤ inj(q; M ) and the sequence ϕi |Ur (p) converges to the diffeo∞ topology on U (p),
morphism expq ◦ Φ ◦ exp−1
r
p : Ur (p) → Ur (q) in the C
and hence Ur (p) ⊂ M0 . This shows that M0 is open, that ϕi |M0 converges
in the C ∞ -topology to a smooth map ϕ : M0 → M , and that ϕ(M0 ) is an
open subset of M .
We prove that M0 is closed. Let pν ∈ M0 be a sequence that converges to an element p ∈ M . Then there exists a real number r > 0 such
that r < inj(pν ; M ) for all ν. Hence Br (pν ) ⊂ M0 for all ν by Step 1.
Choose ν so large that d(pν , p) < r to obtain p ∈ M0 . This shows that M0 is
closed. Since M is connected, we deduce that M0 = M . This proves Step 2.
Step 3. The map ϕ : M → M in Step 2 is an isometry.
We claim that the triple p0 , q0 , Φ0 in (7.3.5) satisfies
lim ϕ−1
i (q0 ) = p0 ,

i→∞

−1
lim dϕ−1
i (q0 ) = Φ0 .

i→∞

(7.3.6)

Namely, the sequence d(ϕ−1
i (q0 ), p0 ) = d(q0 , ϕi (p0 )) converges to zero by assumption, and by Step 1 the derivatives dϕi converge to dϕ uniformly in
some neighborhood U0 ⊂ M of p0 . Since ϕ−1
i (q0 ) ∈ U0 for i sufficiently
large, this implies that the sequence dϕi (ϕ−1
(q
0 )) converges to dϕ(p0 ) = Φ0
i
−1 = dϕ−1 (q ) converges to Φ−1 . This
and hence the sequence dϕi (ϕ−1
(q
))

0
i
i
proves (7.3.6). By (7.3.6) and Step 2 the sequence ϕ−1
converges
in
the C ∞
i
topology to a smooth map ψ : M → M . By uniform convergence on compact subsets of M we have ψ ◦ ϕ = id and ϕ ◦ ψ = id, so ϕ : M → M is a
diffeomorphism. Moreover, since ϕi is an isometry for each i and converges
pointwise to ϕ, we have d(ϕ(p), ϕ(q)) = limi→∞ d(ϕi (p), ϕi (q)) = d(p, q) for
all p, q ∈ M , so ϕ is an isometry. This proves Step 3 and Lemma 7.3.2.

346

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

The next goal is to verify that the spaces Ip in (7.3.4) are diffeomorphic
to each other. For p0 , p1 ∈ M define the map Fp1 ,p0 : Ip0 → Ip1 by
ϕ ∈ I(M ).

Fp1 ,p0 (ϕ(p0 ), dϕ(p0 )) := (ϕ(p1 ), dϕ(p1 )),

(7.3.7)

This map is well-defined by Lemma 5.1.10, because M is connected. Collectively, these maps give rise to a map F : M × I → I defined by

I := (ϕ(p), dϕ(p), p) p ∈ M, ϕ ∈ I(M ) ⊂ G,
(7.3.8)
F(p1 , (ϕ(p0 ), dϕ(p0 ), p0 )) := (ϕ(p1 ), dϕ(p1 ), p1 )
for p0 , p1 ∈ M and ϕ ∈ I(M ). The next lemma uses the concept of a smooth
map on an arbitrary subset of Euclidean space as in the beginning of §2.1.
Lemma 7.3.3. The map F : M × I → I is smooth. In particular, for each
pair of points p0 , p1 ∈ M , the map Fp1 ,p0 : Ip0 → Ip1 is a diffeomorphism.
Proof. Let p0 , p1 ∈ M and choose a smooth path γ : I = [0, 1] → M with
the endpoints γ(0) = p0 and γ(1) = p1 . Let Uγ ⊂ Gp0 be the set of all
pairs (q0 , Φ0 ) ∈ Gp0 such that there exists a development (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) on the
interval I that satisfies
γ ′ (0) = q0 ,

Φ(t) = Φ0 .

(7.3.9)

By Remark 3.5.22, the set Uγ is open in Gp0 and the map Uγ → Gp1 that
sends the pair (q0 , Φ0 ) ∈ Uγ to the pair (γ ′ (1), Φ(1)) ∈ Gp1 is smooth. This
shows that there is a unique diffeomorphism
Fγ : Uγ → Uγ −1 ,

γ −1 (t) := γ(1 − t),

Uγ ⊂ Gp0 ,

Uγ −1 ⊂ Gp1

that satisfies the condition
Fγ (γ ′ (0), Φ(0)) = (γ ′ (1), Φ(1))

(7.3.10)

for every development (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) of M along M on the interval I.

The inverse of Fγ is the smooth map Fγ −1 : Uγ −1 → Uγ . If ϕ ∈ I(M ), then by
Lemma 6.1.12 there exists a development (Φ, γ, γ ′ ) on I satisfying the initial conditions γ ′ (0) = ϕ(p0 ) and Φ(0) = dϕ(p0 ), and it is given by
γ ′ (t) = ϕ(γ(t)),

Φ(t) = dϕ(γ(t))

(7.3.11)

for t ∈ I. Hence (ϕ(p0 ), dϕ(p0 )) ∈ Uγ and by (7.3.10) and (7.3.11) we have
Fγ (ϕ(p0 ), dϕ(p0 )) = (ϕ(p1 ), dϕ(p1 )) = Fp1 ,p0 (ϕ(p0 ), dϕ(p0 ))
for every ϕ ∈ I(M ). Thus Ip0 ⊂ Uγ and Ip1 ⊂ Uγ −1 and Fγ |Ip0 = Fp1 ,p0 .
Hence Fp1 ,p0 is smooth. The smoothness of F follows from the smooth
dependence of the map Fγ on the curve γ, the verification of which we leave
to the reader. This proves Lemma 7.3.3.

Killing Vector Fields

Killing vector fields are defined as those vector fields on M whose flows
are one-parameter families of isometries. Assume throughout that M is a
nonempty connected smooth m-dimensional submanifold of Rn . Let X be
a vector field on M and denote by
R × M ⊃ D → M : (t, p) 7→ ϕ(t, p) = ϕt (p)
the flow of X (Definition 2.4.8). Then Theorem 2.4.9 asserts that D is
an open subset of R × M and ϕ is smooth. Thus, for every t ∈ R, the
set Dt := {p ∈ M | (t, p) ∈ D} is open in M and the map ϕt : Dt → D−t is a
diffeomorphism with the inverse ϕ−t : D−t → Dt .
Lemma 7.3.4. In this situation the following are equivalent.
(i) For every t ∈ R the diffeomorphism ϕt : Dt → D−t is an isometry.
(ii) For every p ∈ M and every pair of tangent vectors u, v ∈ Tp M , we have
⟨∇u X(p), v⟩ + ⟨u, ∇v X(p)⟩ = 0.

(7.3.12)

Proof. Let p ∈ M and v ∈ Tp M . Choose a smooth curve α : R → M such
that α(0) = p and α̇(0) = v, let Ω := {(s, t) ∈ R2 | (s, α(t)) ∈ D}, and define
the map γ : Ω → M by γ(s, t) := ϕt (α(s)) for (s, t) ∈ Ω. Then
∂s γ(0, t) = dϕt (p)v,

∂t γ = X ◦ γ,

∇s ∂t γ = ∇∂s γ X(γ).

Thus the formula ∇t ∂s γ = ∇s ∂t γ in Lemma 3.2.4 shows that
∇t dϕt (p)v = ∇dϕt (p)v X(ϕt (p))

(7.3.13)

for all t ∈ R and this implies
d
2
dϕt (p)v = 2 ∇dϕt (p)v X(ϕt (p)), dϕt (p)v .
dt

(7.3.14)

The right hand side vanishes for all p, v, t if and only if X satisfies (ii),
and the left hand side vanishes for all p, v, t if and only if the flow of X
satisfies (i). This proves Lemma 7.3.4.
Definition 7.3.5. A vector field X ∈ Vect(M ) is called a Killing vector
field (named after Wilhelm Karl Joseph Killing [39]) iff it satisfies equation (7.3.12) for all p ∈ M and all u, v ∈ Tp M . The space of Killing vector
fields will be denoted by VectK (M ).

348

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

The space of Killing vector fields is a vector subspace of the Lie algebra of
all vector fields on M . The next lemma shows that it is a finite-dimensional
Lie subalgebra. Part (ii) is the linear counterpart of Lemma 5.1.10.
Lemma 7.3.6. Let M ⊂ Rn be a nonempty connected smooth m-manifold.
Then the following holds.
(i) If X is a Killing vector field on M and ψ : M → M is an isometry, then
the pullback ψ ∗ X is a Killing vector field. If X and Y are Killing vector
fields on M , then so is their Lie bracket [X, Y ].
(ii) If X is a Killing vector field on M and there exists a p0 ∈ M such that
X(p0 ) = 0,

∇X(p0 ) = 0,

(7.3.15)

then X(p) = 0 for all p ∈ M .
(iii) If M is complete and X is a Killing vector field, then X is complete.
Proof. We prove part (i). Let X be a Killing vector field, let ϕt : Dt → D−t
be the flow of X, and let ψ : M → M be an isometry. Then
ψ −1 ◦ ϕt ◦ ψ : ψ −1 (Dt ) → ψ −1 (D−t )
is the flow of ψ ∗ X. Hence, by Lemma 7.3.4, the flow of ψ ∗ X is a oneparameter family of isometries and so ψ ∗ X is a Killing vector field. Now
assume that Y is another Killing vector field and denote its flow by ψ t .
Then each ψ t is an isometry and so the pullback (ψ t )∗ X is a Killing vector field for each t. Hence, by Lemma 2.4.18 and Exercise 5.2.9, the Lie
d
bracket [X, Y ] = dt
(ψ t )∗ X is also a Killing vector field. This proves (i).
t=0
We prove part (ii). Let ϕt : Dt → D−t be the flow of a Killing vector
field X and assume that there exists a p0 ∈ M such that (7.3.15) holds. Then
it follows from (7.3.13) that ϕt (p0 ) = p0 and dϕt (p0 ) = id for all t. Hence,
by Lemma 5.1.10 the isometry ϕt : Dt → D−t is the identity for each t ∈ R.
Thus Dt = D−t = M for all t and X(p) = 0 for all p ∈ M . This proves (ii).
We prove part (iii). Thus assume that M is complete and X is a
Killing vector field. Let γ : I → M be an integral curve of X on its
maximal existence interval I ⊂ R and denote p := γ(0). Differentiate the
d
|γ̇(t)|2 = 2⟨∇γ̇(t) X(γ(t)), γ̇(t)⟩ = 0 for
equation γ̇(t) = X(γ(t)) to obtain dt
all t ∈ I. Hence the functionR I → R : t 7→ |γ̇(t)| is constant and this implies
t
the inequality d(p, γ(t)) ≤ 0 |γ̇(s)| ds = t|X(p)| for all t ∈ I. Since M is
complete, the closed ball of radius R about p is compact for every R > 0
(Theorem 4.6.5). Hence the restriction of γ to any bounded subinterval
of I is contained in a compact subset of M amd by Corollary 2.4.15 this
implies I = R. This proves (iii) and Lemma 7.3.6.

7.3. THE GROUP OF ISOMETRIES*

The proof of Theorem 7.3.1 is somewhat analogous to the proof of the
Closed Subgroup Theorem 2.5.27. The first parallel is in part (i) of the next
lemma, which asserts that the space of complete Killing vector fields is a Lie
subalgebra of Vect(M ) and can be viewed as an anlogue of Lemma 2.5.29.
Part (ii) is the analogue of Lemma 2.5.28.
Lemma 7.3.7. (i) The set VectK,c (M ) of complete Killing vector fields
on M is a Lie subalgebra of VectK (M ).
(ii) Let R × M → M : (t, p) 7→ ψt (p) be a smooth map such that ψt is an
d
isometry for every t ∈ R and define X(p) := dt
ψ (p) for p ∈ M . Then X

is a complete Killing vector field.
Proof. The proof has three steps.
Step 1. Let U, V ⊂ M be nonempty open sets, let ϕ : U → V be an isometry,
and let ϕk : M → M be a sequence of isometries that converges uniformly
on every compact subset of U to ϕ. Then ϕ extends uniquely to an isometry
from M to M and ϕk converges in the C ∞ topology to this extension.
Fix an element p0 ∈ U . Then by part (i) of Exercise 5.1.11 we have
lim ϕk (p0 ) = ϕ(p0 ),

k→∞

lim dϕk (p0 ) = dϕ(p0 ).

k→∞

Hence the assertion of Step 1 follows from Lemma 7.3.2.
Step 2. We prove part (ii).
That X is a Killing vector field follows from the same argument as in
Lemma 7.3.4 with time dependent vector fields. Denote by ϕt : Dt → D−t
k : M → M converges
the flow of X. Then the sequence of isometries ψt/k
to ϕt uniformly on every compact subset of Dt (see Exercise 7.3.10 below).
Hence Step 1 asserts that ϕt extends to an isometry on all of M whenever Dt is nonempty, in particular for small t. The extended isometries still
satisfy ϕs+t = ϕs ◦ ϕt and ∂t ϕt = X ◦ ϕt . Thus Dt = M for small t and so for
all t, because ϕ−s (D−s ∩ Dt ) ⊂ Ds+t (Theorem 2.4.9). This proves Step 2.
Step 3. We prove part (i).
Let X, Y ∈ VectK,c (M ), let ϕt be the flow of X, and let ψ t be the flow of Y .
d
Then dt
ϕt ◦ ψ t (p) = X(p) + Y (p) for all p ∈ M , and so X + Y is a comt=0
plete Killing vector field by Step 2. Hence VectK,c (M ) is a vector space. It is
finite-dimensional by Lemma 7.3.6. Moreover, (ψ −t ◦ϕs ◦ψ t )s∈R is the flow of
the pullback vector field (ψ t )∗ X, hence (ψ t )∗ X is a complete Killing vector
d
field for each t ∈ R, and hence so is the Lie bracket [X, Y ] = dt
|t=0 (ψ t )∗ X
by finite-dimensionality. This proves Step 3 and Lemma 7.3.7.

Exercise 7.3.8. Let M ⊂ Rn be a smooth manifold and let X be a vector
field on M . Consider the following condition.
(K) If γ : I → M is a geodesic, then X ◦γ ∈ Vect(γ) is a Jacobi field along γ,
i.e. it satisfies the differential equation ∇∇(X ◦ γ) + R(X ◦ γ, γ̇)γ̇ = 0.
Prove that every Killing vector field satisfies (K) and use this to give an
alternative proof of part (ii) of Lemma 7.3.6. If M is compact, prove that
a vector field satisfies (K) if and only if it is a Killing vector field. Find a

Proof of the Myers–Steenrod Theorem

With these preparations we are ready to prove Theorem 7.3.1. The following
lemma is the heart of the proof. It is the analogue of Lemma 2.5.30 in the
proof of the Closed Subgroup Theorem 2.5.27.
Lemma 7.3.11. Fix an element p0 ∈ M , a tangent vector v0 ∈ Tp0 M , and a
linear map A0 : Tp0 M → Tp0 M . Let ϕi ∈ I(M ) be a sequence of isometries
and let τi be a sequence of positive real numbers such that
lim τi = 0,

lim ϕi (p0 ) = p0 ,

i→∞

i→∞

lim dϕi (p0 ) = 1l,

and, for all v ∈ Tp0 M ,

Then there exists a unique complete Killing vector field X on M such that
lim

i→∞

X(p0 ) = v0 ,

dX(p0 ) = A0 .

(7.3.21)

For every p ∈ M and every v ∈ Tp M this vector field satisfies

= X(p),
lim

i→∞

and the convergence is uniform on compact subsets of T M .
lim

i→∞

(7.3.22)

Proof. By (7.3.19), (7.3.20), and Exercise 2.2.4 we have
(p0 , A0 ) ∈ T(p0 ,1l) Gp0 .
Let p ∈ M and recall the definition of the map Fp,p0 : Ip0 → Ip in (7.3.7).
By Lemma 7.3.3 this map extends to a diffeomorphism Fγ from an open subset Uγ ⊂ Gp0 containing the set Ip0 to an open subset Uγ −1 ⊂ Gp containing
the set Ip and it satisfies Fγ (p0 , 1l) = (p, 1l). Define
(X(p), A(p)) := dFγ (p0 , 1l)(v0 , A0 ) ∈ T(p,1l) Gp .
Since Fγ (ϕi (p0 ), dϕi (p0 )) = (ϕi (p), dϕi (p)) for all i, it follows from (7.3.20)
and Exercise 2.2.16 that, for all v ∈ Tp M , we have
lim

ϕi (p) − p

τi

lim

i→∞

dϕi (p)v − v

τi

(7.3.23)

This formula shows that the pair (X(p), A(p)) ∈ T(p,1l) Gp is independent of
the choice of the extension Fγ used to define it. Moreover, it follows from the
smoothness of the map F in Lemma 7.3.3 that the map p 7→ (X(p), A(p))
is smooth and that the convergence in (7.3.23) is uniform as the pair (p, v)
varies over any compact subset of T M .

Now let v ∈ Tp M and define γ(t) := expp (tv) for t ∈ Ip,v . Then

Here the last step uses uniform convergence on compact sets in (7.3.23).
Divide by t and use the continuity of the curve t 7→ A(γ(t))γ̇(t) to obtain

A(p)v = lim
A(γ(s))γ̇(s) ds = lim

Hence, by Exercise 2.2.16, we deduce that, for all p ∈ M and all v ∈ Tp M ,
A(p)v = dX(p)v.
By (7.3.20) and (7.3.23) this shows that X satisfies (7.3.21) and (7.3.22).
By (7.3.22) and Exercise 2.2.4 we have (X(p), dX(p)) ∈ T(p,1l) Gp and this
implies ⟨v, dX(p)v⟩ = 0 for all v ∈ Tp M . Here is a more direct proof of this
crucial fact. Namely, by (7.3.22) we have
|dϕi (p)v − v|2
= |dX(p)v|2 .

Hence
⟨v, dϕi (p)v − v⟩

for all p ∈ M and all v ∈ Tp M . This shows that X is a Killing vector field
and so it remains to prove that X is complete.

7.3. THE GROUP OF ISOMETRIES*

Let ϕt : Dt → D−t be the flow of X and, for p ∈ M , denote by

Ip := t ∈ R p ∈ Dt
the maximal existence interval for the solution γ of the initial value problem γ̇(t) = X(γ(t)), γ(0) = p. We prove in three steps that X is complete.
Step 1. Let p ∈ M and let T > 0 such that T |X(p)| < inj(p; M ). Then
[−T, T ] ⊂ Ip .
Define γ(t) := ϕt (p) for t ∈ Ip . Since X is a Killing vector field, the diffeomorphism ϕt : Dt → D−t is an isometry by Lemma 7.3.4, and hence
|γ̇(t)| = |X(ϕt (p))| = |dϕt (p)X(p)| = |X(p)|,
for all t ∈ Ip . This implies d(p, γ(t)) ≤ t|X(p)| for all t ∈ Ip , and hence γ
cannot leave the compact set UT |X(p)| (p) = {q ∈ M | d(p, q) ≤ T |X(p)|} on
any subinterval I ⊂ [−T, T ]. Hence [−T, T ] ⊂ Ip by Corollary 2.4.15 and
this proves Step 1.
Step 2. Let p ∈ M . If t ∈ R satisfies |tX(p)| < inj(p; M ) and the sequence
of integers mi ∈ Z is chosen such that
mi τi ≤ t < (mi + 1)τi ,

(7.3.24)

i
then ϕt (p) = limi→∞ ϕm
i (p).

Let T > 0 such that T |X(p)| < inj(p; M ). Then [0, T ] ⊂ Ip by Step 1 and
the set

K := ϕt (p) 0 ≤ t ≤ T
is compact and |X(q)| = |X(p)| for all q ∈ K. By Lemma 4.2.7 there exists
a constant δ > 0 such that, for all q, q0 , q1 ∈ M ,
q ∈ K,

d(q, q0 ) ≤ δ,

d(q, q1 ) ≤ δ

d(q0 , q1 )

Fix a real number 0 < ε ≤ 1 and choose i0 ∈ N such that, for all i ≥ i0 ,

Then, for all i ≥ i0 and all q ∈ K, we have d(q, ϕτi (q)) ≤ τi |X(p)| < δ
and d(q, ϕi (q)) < δ by (7.3.26), and hence by (7.3.25) and (7.3.27),
sup d(ϕi (q), ϕτi (q)) ≤ 2 sup |ϕi (q) − ϕτi (q)| ≤ 4τi ε.

Now choose a real number 0 ≤ t ≤ T and choose mi ∈ N0 as in (7.3.24).

and this proves Step 2 for t ≥ 0. For t ≤ 0 the argument is similar.
Step 3. Ip = R for every p ∈ M .
Fix an element p ∈ M and real number T > 0 such that T |X(p)| < inj(p; M ).
Choose the sequence mi ∈ N0 such that τi mi ≤ T < (mi + 1)τi . Then Step 2
mi
i
asserts that ϕT (p) = limi→∞ ϕm
i (p). Since ϕi : M → M is an isometry, it
mi
follows that T |X(p)| < inj(ϕi (p); M ) for all i ∈ N and hence

T |X(p)| < inj ϕT (p); M .
By Step 1 this implies [0, T ] ⊂ IϕT (p) . Hence [0, 2T ] ⊂ Ip and, by Step 2,

i
ϕ2T (p) = lim ϕm
ϕT (p) .
i
i→∞

Continue by induction to obtain for all k ∈ N that

T |X(p)| < inj ϕkT (p); M
and hence [0, (k + 1)T ] ⊂ Ip and

i
ϕ(k+1)T (p) = lim ϕm
ϕkT (p) .

i→∞

Thus [0, ∞) ⊂ Ip and the same argument shows that (−∞, 0] ⊂ Ip . Hence X
is complete. This proves Step 3 and Lemma 7.3.11.

The next lemma establishes the smooth structure on I(M ), in analogy
to the proof of the Closed Subgroup Theorem 2.5.27.
Lemma 7.3.12. For every p ∈ M the set Ip is a smooth submanifold of Gp
and its tangent space at (q, Φ) ∈ Ip is given by

T(q,Φ) Ip = (X(q), dX(q)Φ) X ∈ VectK,c (M ) .
(7.3.29)
Proof. By Lemma 3.4.5 with Rm replaced by Tp M the tangent space of Gp
at an element (q, Φ) ∈ Gp is given by

If (q, Φ) ∈ Gp and X ∈ Vect(M ), then (1l − Π(q))dX(q)Φ = hq (X(q))Φ by
the Gauß–Weingarten formula in Remark 5.2.5. Moreover, if X is a Killing
vector field, then ⟨Φu, dX(q)Φv⟩ + ⟨dX(q)Φu, Φv⟩ = 0 for all u, v ∈ Tp M , so
b with qb = X(q) and Φ
b = dX(q)Φ
it follows from (7.3.30) that the pair (b
q , Φ)
is a tangent vector of Gp at (q, Φ).
Now abbreviate

Fix an isometry ϕ0 : M → M and define
(q0 , Φ0 ) := (ϕ0 (p), dϕ0 (p)) = ιp (ϕ0 ) ∈ Ip .
We must construct a coordinate chart on Gp in a neighborhood of the
point (q0 , Φ0 ) ∈ Ip with values in an open set Ω ⊂ Rℓ that sends Ip to the
intersection of Ω with Rk × {0}. For this we first choose a basis Y1 , . . . , Yk

and

dΘ(0) t̂1 , . . . , t̂ℓ = t̂1 η1 + · · · + t̂ℓ ηℓ

for t̂1 , . . . , t̂ℓ ∈ Rℓ . Thus the derivative dΘ(0) : Rℓ → T(q0 ,Φ0 ) Gp is a bijective linear map and so the Inverse Function Theorem asserts that the
map Θ restricts to a diffeomorphism from a sufficiently small open neighborhood Ω ⊂ Rℓ of the origin onto its image ι(Ω) ⊂ Gp , which is an open
neighborhood in Gp of the point Θ(0) = ιp (ϕ0 ) ∈ Ip . With this understood,
the assertion that Ip is a smooth submanifold of Gp is a direct consequence
of the following Claim.
Claim. There exists an open set Ω0 ⊂ Rℓ such that

0 ∈ Ω0 ⊂ Ω,
Θ Ω0 ∩ (Rk × {0}) = U0 ∩ Ip ,
U0 := Θ(Ω0 ). (7.3.32)
Suppose, by contradiction, that such
 an open set Ω0 does not exist. Then
there exist sequences ti = t1i , . . . , tℓi ∈ Rℓ and ϕi ∈ I(M ) such that

lim ti = 0,
ti ∈ Ω \ Rk × {0} ,
Θ(ti ) = ιp (ϕi ) ∈ Ip .

Define

Then ψXi (qi ), dψXi (qi )Φi = Θ(ti ) = ιp (ϕi ) = ϕi (p), dϕi (p) and hence

It follows from (7.3.35) and Lemma 7.3.11 that there exists a complete
Killing vector field X ∈ VectK,c (M ) such that
X(p) = v0 ,

dX(p) = A0 .

This vector field is nonzero because (v0 , A0 ) ̸= 0 by (7.3.34). Moreover, by
equation (7.3.22) in Lemma 7.3.11, with ϕi replaced by ϕi ◦ ϕ−1
0 and the
pair (p, v) replaced by the pair (ϕ0 (p), dϕ0 (p)v), we obtain
ϕi (p) − ϕ0 (p)

dX(ϕ0 (p))dϕ0 (p)v = lim

(ϕi (p), dϕi (p)) = ιp (ϕi ) = ι(ti )
converges to (ϕ0 (p), dϕ0 (p)) = ι(0), the pair (X(ϕ0 (p)), dX(ϕ0 (p))dϕ0 (p))
belongs to the image of the derivative dι(0) by Exercise 2.2.4, and hence
is a nonzero linear combination of the vectors ηk+1 , . . . , ηℓ . It is also a
linear combination of the vectors η1 , . . . , ηk , because X is a complete Killing
vector field and so is a linear combination of the vector fields Y1 , . . . , Yk .
This is a contradiction, and this contradiction proves the Claim. Thus there
does, after all, exist an open set Ω0 ⊂ Rℓ that satisfies (7.3.32), and the
map Θ−1 : U0 → Ω0 is then a coordinate chart on Gp which satisfies
Θ−1 (U0 ∩ Ip ) = Ω0 ∩ (Rk × {0}).
Hence Ip is a submanifold of Gp and this proves Lemma 7.3.12.

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Proof of Theorem 7.3.1. By Lemma 7.3.3 and Lemma 7.3.12 there exists
a unique smooth structure on I(M ) such that the map ιp : I(M ) → Gp
in (7.3.3) is an embedding for every p ∈ M . That the topology induced
by this smooth structure agrees with the C ∞ topology was established in
Lemma 7.3.2. That it also agrees with the compact open topology (i.e. with
the C 0 topology of uniform convergence on conpact sets) is the content of
Exercise 5.1.11. This proves part (i).
We prove part (ii). Recall the definition of the map
F :M ×I →I
in (7.3.8) and the target map t : G → M , the inverse map i : G → G, and the
composition map m : (s × t)−1 (∆) → G in the beginning of §7.3.1. These
maps are all smooth and turn I into a smooth subgroupoid of G. For
each p ∈ M they endow the submanifold Ip ⊂ Gp with the structure of a Lie
group as follows. The unit is the element
ep := (p, 1l) ∈ Ip

(7.3.36)

The product is the map mp : Ip × Ip → Ip defined by



(mp (η, ξ), p) := m F t(ξ, p), (η, p) , ξ, p

(7.3.37)

for ξ, η ∈ Ip , and the inverse map is the involution ip : Ip → Ip defined by

(ip (ξ), p) := F p, i(ξ, p)
(7.3.38)
for ξ ∈ Ip . The maps mp in (7.3.37) and ip in (7.3.38) are smooth by
definition. To show that they define a group structure and that the map

for all ϕ, ψ ∈ I(p). The first equation in (7.3.39) follows directly from the

and define ξ, η, ζ ∈ Ip by
ξ := ιp (ϕ),

η := ιp (ψ),

ζ := ιp (ψ ◦ ϕ).

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Examples and Exercises

Throughout we denote by I0 (M ) ⊂ I(M ) the connected component of the
identity in the group of isometries of a Riemannian manifold M .
Example 7.3.14. The isometry group of Rm is the group of all affine transformations of Rm with orthogonal linear part (Exercise 5.1.4).
Example 7.3.15. We have seen in Example 6.4.16 that the isometry group
of the m-sphere S m ⊂ Rm+1 is the group I(S m ) = O(m + 1) of orthogonal transformations of the ambient space. In the case m = 2 a theorem
of Smale [72] asserts that the inclusion O(3) = I(S 2 ) ,→ Diff(S 2 ) of the
isometry group of the 2-sphere into the infinite-dimensional group of all
diffeomorphisms of the 2-sphere is a homotopy equivalence.
Example 7.3.16. In §6.4.3 we have introduced the hyperbolic space Hm . Its
isometry group is the group I(Hm ) = O(m, 1) of all linear transformations
of Rm+1 that preserve the quadratic form Q in (6.4.9) (Exercise 6.4.25). In
the case m = 2 the identity component of this group is isomorphic to the Lie
group PSL(2, R) = SL(2, R)/{±1l}. Geometrically this can be understood by
examining the upper half space model of H2 (Exercise 6.4.27).
The preceding three examples are the constant sectional curvature manifolds discussed in §6.2 and §6.4. In all three cases the isometry group has
the maximal dimension dim(I(M )) = m(m + 1)/2 and is diffeomorphic to
the orthonormal frame bundle O(M ), so these examples satisfy the condition Ip = Gp in the notation of §7.3.1. By Corollary 6.4.13 a complete,
connected, simply connected manifold M satisfies Ip = Gp if and only if it
has constant sectional curvature.
Exercise 7.3.17. Consider the incomplete 2-manifolds
M0 := R2 \ {(0, 0)},

M1 := R2 \ Z2 .

Prove that for i = 0, 1 every isometry of Mi extends to an isometry of R2 and
so I(Mi ) is a subgroup of the Lie group I(R2 ) of affine maps with orthogonal
linear part (Example 7.3.14). The isometry group of M0 is isomorphic to
the Lie group O(2). The isometry group of M1 is discrete and is an example
of a so-called wallpaper group (of which there are 17). The Lie algebra
of Killing vector fields in both cases has dimension 3. Which Killing vector
fields are not complete? Hint: A Killing vector field on a connected open
set M ⊂ R2 is a smooth map M → R2 : (x, y) 7→ (u(x, y), v(x, y)) that
satisfies the equations ∂x u = ∂y v = 0 and ∂y u + ∂x v = 0. Deduce that the
map (u, v) is affine and has a skew-symmetric linear part.

7.3. THE GROUP OF ISOMETRIES*

361

Example 7.3.18. The identity component of the isometry group of the
complex projective space CPn (Example 2.8.5) with the Fubini–Study metric
(Example 3.7.5) is the group
I0 (CPn ) = PSU(n + 1) = SU(n + 1)/Z(SU(n + 1)) ∼
= U(n + 1)/U(1).

Here Z(SU(n + 1)) = λ1l | λ ∈ S 1 , λn+1 = 1 ∼
= Z/(n + 1)Z is the center
of the group SU(n + 1). We emphasize that the dimension n(n + 2) of
the isometry group I(CPn ) is smaller than the dimension n(2n + 1) of the
orthonormal frame bundle O(CPn ) unless n = 0 or n = 1.
In the case n = 1 the projective line CP1 is isometric to the 2-sphere
by stereographic projection (Exercise 2.8.13 and Example 3.7.5). Hence the
identity component PSU(2) of the isometry group of CP1 is isomorphic to
the identity component SO(3) of the isometry group of S 2 . An explicit
isomorphism is discussed in Exercise 2.5.22.
The full isometry group I(CPn ) has two connected components. In the
case n = 2 it is an open question whether the inclusion I(CP2 ) ,→ Diff(CP2 )
of the isometry group of CP2 into the group of all diffeomorphisms of CP2 is
a homotopy equivalence. By deep results of Gromov [21] and Taubes [74] a
positive answer to this question is equivalent to the assertion that the space
of symplectic forms on CP2 in a fixed cohomology class is contractible (the
symplectic uniqueness conjecture for CP2 ). It is not even known whether this
space is connected or, equivalently, whether every diffeomorphism of CP2
that induces the identity on cohomology is isotopic to the identity. For a
more detailed discussion see [67, Example 3.4] and [49, Example 13.4.1].
Example 7.3.19. The identity component I0 (S 2 ×S 2 ) of the isometry group
of the product manifold M = S 2 × S 2 is the product group SO(3) × SO(3).
In contrast to Smales’ Theorem the inclusion I0 (S 2 × S 2 ) ,→ Diff 0 (S 2 × S 2 )
into the group of diffeomorphisms of S 2 ×S 2 that are isotopic to the identity
is not a homotopy equivalence. For example, if ϕx,θ : S 2 → S 2 denotes the
rotation about the axis through x ∈ S 2 by the angle θ ∈ R/2πZ and the
diffeomorphism ψθ : S 2 × S 2 → S 2 × S 2 is defined by
ψθ (x, y) := (x, ϕx,θ (y)),

x, y ∈ S 2 ,

then the loop R/2πZ → Diff 0 (S 2 × S 2 ) : θ 7→ ψθ is not contractible and
neither is any of its iterates. Thus Diff 0 (S 2 ×S 2 ) has an infinite fundamental
group while the fundamental group of SO(3) × SO(3) is finite. For S 2 ×S 2 it
is an open question whether every diffeomorphism that induces the identity
on cohomology is isotopic to the identity. For a more detailed discussion
see [67, Example 3.5] and [49, Example 13.4.2].

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Isometries of Compact Lie Groups*

In the following theorem we denote by I0 (M ) the connected component of
the identity in the group of all isometries of a manifold M .
Theorem 7.4.1. Let G ⊂ GL(n, R) be a compact connected Lie group
equipped with a bi-invariant Riemannian metric. If ϕ ∈ I0 (G), then there
exist elements a, b ∈ G such that
ϕ(g) = ϕa,b (g) := agb−1

for all g ∈ G.

(7.4.1)

The proof of Theorem 7.4.1 makes use of the Killing form introduced in
Example 5.2.25. Recall the definition of the center Z(g) in Exercise 2.5.34
and of the commutant [g, g] ⊂ g in Exercise 5.2.24. The heart of the proof
is Lemma 7.4.3. The case where the Lie algebra has a nontrivial center is
then dealt with in Lemma 7.4.5.
Lemma 7.4.2. Let g be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra that admits an
invariant inner product and has a trivial center. Then the Killing form on g
is nondegenerate.
Proof. Exercise 5.2.27.
Lemma 7.4.3. Let g be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra and assume that
the Killing form on g is nondegenerate. Then the following holds.
(i) Z(g) = {0} and [g, g] = g.
(ii) The Lie algebra homomorphism ad : g → Der(g) is bijective.
(iii) Every derivation δ : g → g has trace zero.
(iv) Let δ : g → g be a linear map such that, for all ξ, η, ζ ∈ g,
δ[[ξ, η], ζ] = [[δξ, η], ζ] + [[ξ, δη], ζ] + [[ξ, η], δζ].

(7.4.2)

Then there exists a unique element ξδ ∈ g such that δξ = [ξδ , ξ] for all ξ ∈ g.
Proof. We prove part (i). If ξ ∈ Z(g), then ad(ξ) = 0, hence κ(ξ, η) = 0 for
all η ∈ g, and hence ξ = 0 by nondegeneracy of the Killing form. To prove
that [g, g] = g, assume that Λ : g → R is any linear functional that vanishes
on the commutant [g, g]. Since the Killing form is nondegenerate, there exists
an element ζ ∈ g such that Λ = κ(ζ, ·). Hence 0 = κ(ζ, [ξ, η]) = κ([ζ, ξ], η)
for all ξ, η ∈ g. Since the Killing form is nondegenerate, this implies [ζ, ξ] = 0
for all ξ ∈ g, hence ζ ∈ Z(g), hence ζ = 0, and hence Λ = 0. This proves (i).

7.4. ISOMETRIES OF COMPACT LIE GROUPS*

363

We prove part (ii). The map ad : g → Der(g) is injective by part (i).
Choose a basis ξ1 , . . . , ξk of g. Since the Killing form is nondegenerate,
there exists a dual basis P
η1 , . . . , ηk of g such that κ(ξi , ηj ) = δij for all i, j.
These basesPsatisfy ζ = i κ(η

define ξ := i trace δ ad(ξi ) ηi ∈ g. Then, for all ζ ∈ g, we have
 X


trace δ ad(ζ) =
κ(ηi , ζ)trace δ ad(ξi ) = κ(ξ, ζ) = trace ad(ξ)ad(ζ) .
i

Thus the derivation ε := δ − ad(ξ) satisfies trace(ε ad(ζ)) = 0 for all ζ ∈ g.
Since [ε, ad(η)] = ad(εη), this implies



κ εη, ζ = trace ad(εη)ad(ζ) = trace [ε, ad(η)]ad(ζ)


= trace ε[ad(η), ad(ζ)] = trace ε ad([η, ζ]) = 0
for all η, ζ ∈ g. Hence ε = 0 by nondegeneracy of the Killing form and
hence δ = ad(ξ). This proves (ii).
We prove part (iii). Since trace(ad([ξ, η])) = trace([ad(ξ), ad(η)]) = 0 for
all ξ, η ∈ g and [g, g] = g by part (i), we have trace(ad(ξ)) = 0 for all ξ ∈ g.
Hence (iii) follows from part (ii).
We prove part (iv). Define the bilinear map Bδ : g × g → g by
Bδ (ξ, η) := δ[ξ, η] − [δξ, η] − [ξ, δη]

(7.4.3)

for ξ, η ∈ g. Then equation (7.4.2) can be expressed in the form
Bδ ([ξ, η], ζ) + [Bδ (ξ, η), ζ] = 0

(7.4.4)

for ξ, η, ζ ∈ g. By part (i) there exists a basis of g consisting of vectors of the
form ei = [ξi , ηi ]. Define the linear map Aδ : g → g by Aδ ei := −Bδ (ξi , ηi ).
Then Bδ (ei , ζ) = [Aδ ei , ζ] for all i and ζ by (7.4.4). Hence
Bδ (ξ, η) = [Aδ ξ, η] = [ξ, Aδ η]

(7.4.5)

for all ξ, η ∈ g. Here the second equality holds by the skew-symmetry of Bδ .
By the Jacobi identity and equations (7.4.4) and (7.4.5) we have
2[Bδ (ξ, η), ζ] = [[ξ, Aδ η], ζ] + [[Aδ ξ, η], ζ]
= −[[ζ, ξ], Aδ η] − [[Aδ η, ζ], ξ] + [[Aδ ξ, η], ζ]
= −Bδ ([ζ, ξ], η) − [Bδ (η, ζ), ξ] + [[Aδ ξ, η], ζ]
= [Bδ (ζ, ξ), η] + Bδ ([η, ζ], ξ) + [[Aδ ξ, η], ζ]
= [[ζ, Aδ ξ], η] + [[η, ζ], Aδ ξ] + [[Aδ ξ, η], ζ] = 0
for all ξ, η, ζ ∈ g. Since Z(g) = {0} by part (i), we find that Bδ (ξ, η) = 0
for all ξ, η ∈ g, hence δ is a derivation, and hence δ is in the image of the
map ad : g → Der(g) by part (ii). This proves (iv) and Lemma 7.4.3.

364

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Lemma 7.4.4. The assertion of Theorem 7.4.1 holds under the additional
assumption that the center of the Lie algebra g = Lie(G) is trivial.
Proof. Let ϕ ∈ I0 (G) and choose a smooth isotopy [0, 1] → I0 (G) : t 7→ ϕt
joining the identity ϕ0 = id to ϕ1 = ϕ. For 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 define the diffeomorphism ψt : G → G by ψt (g) := ϕt (1l)−1 ϕt (g). Then each ψt is an isometry
and the path [0, 1] → I0 (G) : t 7→ ψt satisfies
ψ0 = id,

ψt (1l) = 1l

for all t. By Theorem 5.3.1 the derivatives Ψt := dψt (1l) : g → g preserve
the Riemann curvature tensor of G at 1l and by Example 5.2.18 (for the
standard metric on Lie subgroups of O(n)) and Exercise 5.2.22 (for general
bi-invariant Riemannian metrics) this translates into the condition
Ψt [[ξ, η], ζ] = [[Ψt ξ, Ψt η], Ψt ζ]

(7.4.6)

d
for all t and all ξ, η, ζ ∈ g. Hence the endomorphism δt := Ψ−1
t dt Ψt : g → g
satisfies (7.4.2) for each t. Moreover, by Lemma 7.4.2 the Killing form on g
is nondegenerate. Hence it follows from Lemma 7.4.3 that there exists a
d
smooth path [0, 1] → g : t 7→ ξt such that Ψ−1
t dt Ψt = ad(ξt ) for all t. Thus

d
Ψt = Ψt ad(ξt ),
dt

Ψ0 = 1l.

(7.4.7)

Now let [0, 1] → G : t 7→ bt be the solution of the differential equation
d
bt = bt ξt ,
dt

b0 = 1l,

(7.4.8)

d
and define Φt := Ad(bt ) (Example 2.5.23). Then dt
Φt = Φt ad(ξt ) for all t
and Φ0 = 1l. Thus Φt = Ψt and so

Ψt η = bt ηb−1
t

(7.4.9)

for all t and η. Take t = 1, define b := b1 , and use Lemma 5.1.10 (uniqueness
of local isometries) to obtain ψ1 (g) = bgb−1 for all g ∈ G. Hence
ϕ(g) = ϕ(1l)ψ1 (g) = ϕ(1l)bgb−1 = agb−1
for all g ∈ G with a := ϕ(1l)b. This proves Lemma 7.4.4.
We will denote by Z0 (G) ⊂ Z(G) the connected component of 1l in the
center of G. Then Z0 (G) ⊂ G is a compact connected abelian Lie subgroup
of G (Exercise 2.5.34). Since G is connected, its Lie algebra is the center
of g, i.e. Lie(Z0 (G)) = Z(g).

7.4. ISOMETRIES OF COMPACT LIE GROUPS*

365

Lemma 7.4.5. Let G ⊂ GL(n, R) be a compact connected Lie group with a
bi-invariant Riemannian metric and let ϕ ∈ I0 (G). Then
ϕ(hg) = ϕ(gh) = ϕ(g)h = hϕ(g)

(7.4.10)

for all g ∈ G and all h ∈ Z0 (G).
Proof. The proof relies on the following basic observations.
(a) Z0 (G) is a compact connected Lie subgroup of G and Lie(Z0 (G)) = Z(g).
(b) exp(ξ + η) = exp(ξ) exp(η) for all ξ, η ∈ Z(g).
(c) The exponential map exp : Z(g) → Z0 (G) is surjective.
(d) Λ := {ξ ∈ Z(g) | exp(ξ) = 1l} is a discrete additive subgroup of Z(g)
which spans Z(g).
Part (a) was noted above, part (b) follows from Exercise 2.5.39 because the
Lie algebra Z(g) is commutative, and part (c) follows from the Hopf–Rinow
Theorem 4.6.6. That the set Λ is an additive subgroup of Z(g) follows
directly from (b). Moreover, by (a) and (b) the exponential map restricts to
a local diffeomorphism exp : Z(g) → Z0 (G). Hence Λ is discrete and by (c)
the exponential map descends to a proper map from Z(g)/Λ onto Z0 (G).
Since Z0 (G) is compact, the lattice Λ spans the vector space Z(g).
Now assume ϕ(1l) = 1l and define Φ := dϕ(1l) : g → g. Then
ϕ(exp(ξ)) = exp(Φξ)

(7.4.11)

for all ξ ∈ g by Corollary 5.3.3 and Example 5.2.18. Moreover, Φ is an
orthogonal transformation of g that preserves the Riemann curvature tensor
(Theorem 5.3.1). Thus |[Φξ, Φη]| = |[ξ, η]| for all ξ, η ∈ g by Example 5.2.18.
So, if ξ ∈ Z(g), then [ξ, η] = 0 for all η, hence [Φξ, Φη] = 0 for all η, and
hence Φξ ∈ Z(g). This shows that
ΦZ(g) = Z(g).

(7.4.12)

By (7.4.11) and (7.4.12) we have ξ ∈ Λ if and only if ϕ(exp(ξ)) = 1l if and
only if exp(Φξ) = 1l if and only if Φξ ∈ Λ, so that ΦΛ = Λ. Since ϕ is isotopic
to the identity through isometries, by assumption, there exists a smooth
path of orthogonal transformations Φt of g from Φ0 = 1l to Φ1 = Φ that
satisfy Φt Λ = Λ for all t. Thus Φξ = ξ for all ξ ∈ Λ and so for all ξ ∈ Z(g)
because the lattice spans the subspace Z(g) by (d). Hence, by (7.4.11)
and (c), we obtain ϕ(h) = h for all h ∈ Z0 (G) whenever ϕ(1l) = 1l.
To prove equation (7.4.10) in general, fix an element g ∈ G and define the
diffeomorphism ϕg : G → G by ϕg (h) := ϕ(g)−1 ϕ(gh) for h ∈ G. Then ϕg is
an isometry and ϕg (1l) = 1l. Moreover, ϕg ∈ I0 (G), because G is connected.
Hence ϕg (h) = h for all h ∈ Z0 (G) and this proves Lemma 7.4.5.

366

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Proof of Theorem 7.4.1. Let ϕ ∈ I0 (G). By Lemma 7.4.5, ϕ descends to a
diffeomorphism ϕ̄ : Ḡ → Ḡ of the quotient group
Ḡ := G/Z0 (G).
The Lie algebra of Ḡ is the quotient space
ḡ := g/Z(g) ∼
= Z(g)⊥
and the invariant inner product on g restricts to an invariant inner product
on the orthogonal complement of Z(g). This defines a bi-invariant Riemannian metric on Ḡ. The diffeomorphism ϕ̄ is an isometry with respect
to this metric, because the derivative dϕ(g) : Tg G → Tϕ(g) G is an orthogonal transformation, which by (7.4.10) sends a tangent vector gη ∈ Tg G
with η ∈ Z(g) to dϕ(g)gη = ϕ(g)η ∈ Tϕ(g) G, and hence it sends the subspace gZ(g)⊥ ⊂ Tg G to ϕ(g)Z(g)⊥ ⊂ Tϕ(g) G. Apply Lemma 7.4.4 to the
isometry ϕ̄ to obtain elements a, b ∈ G whose equivalence classes ā, b̄ ∈ Ḡ
satisfy ϕ̄(ḡ) = āḡ b̄−1 for all ḡ ∈ Ḡ. This implies
α(g) := a−1 ϕ(g)bg −1 ∈ Z0 (G)

(7.4.13)

for all g ∈ G. Moreover, it follows from Lemma 7.4.5 that
α(gh) = α(g)

(7.4.14)

for all g ∈ G and all h ∈ Z0 (g). Now define the isometry ψ : G → G by
ψ(g) := a−1 ϕ(g)b = α(g)g

(7.4.15)

for g ∈ G. Fix an element g ∈ G and define the linear maps A, Ψ : g → g by
Aξ := α(g)−1 dα(g)gξ,

Ψξ := ψ(g)−1 dψ(g)gξ

(7.4.16)

for ξ ∈ g. Then Ψ = id + A by (7.4.15) and the map A vanishes on Z(g)
by (7.4.14) and takes values in Z(g) by (7.4.13). Since Ψ is an orthogonal
transformation, this implies
Ψ = id,

A = 0.

Hence it follows from the definition of the linear map A in (7.4.16) that the
map α : G → Z0 (G) in (7.4.13) is constant. Thus
ϕ(g) = α(1l)agb−1
for all g ∈ G, and this proves Theorem 7.4.1.

7.4. ISOMETRIES OF COMPACT LIE GROUPS*

367

Corollary 7.4.6. Let G be a compact connected Lie group equipped with
a bi-invariant Riemannian metric. Then the map (a, b) 7→ ϕa,b in Theorem 7.4.1 descends to a Lie Group isomorphism
ρG : (G × G)/Z(G) → I0 (G).

(7.4.17)

Proof. The map G × G → I0 (G) : (a, b) 7→ ϕa,b is a group homomorphism by
definition, is smooth by Theorem 7.3.1, and is surjective by Theorem 7.4.1.
Moreover, ϕa,b is the identity if and only if a = b ∈ Z(G). Hence the map ρG
in (7.4.17) is a Lie group isomorphism, with the smooth structure on the
quotient group (G × G)/Z(G) determined by Theorem 2.9.14. This proves
Corollary 7.4.6.
Example 7.4.7. Theorem 7.4.1 establishes a one-to-one correspondence
between isometries ϕ ∈ I0 (G) that satisfy ϕ(1l) = 1l (the case a = b) and Lie
group automorphisms of G in the identity component. This correspondence
does not extend to other connected components.
For example, in the case G = Tn = Rn /Zn the group of automorphisms
of Tn is the infinite group Aut(Tn ) = GL(n, Z) of integer matrices with
determinant ±1, while the group of isometries that fix the origin is the
finite subgroup O(n, Z) ⊂ GL(n, Z) of orthogonal integer matrices. Also,
if G is not abelian, then the isometry G → G : g 7→ g −1 is not a Lie group
automorphism, but a Lie group anti-automorphism.
Exercise 7.4.8. Examine the case G = SU(2) (Example 2.5.21) and deduce
that there exists a Lie group isomorphism

SO(4) ∼

Convex Functions on Hadamard Manifolds*

The last two sections of this book are devoted to Donaldson’s beautiful
paper [17] in which he develops a differential geometric approach to Lie
algebra theory. The results of [17] will be explained in reverse order. The
first subsection examines the sphere at infinity of a Hadamard manifold M
and contains a proof of [17, Theorem 4], which asserts that every convex
function f : M → R that is invariant under the action of a Lie group G
by isometries must attain its minimum whenever the G-action has no fixed
point at infinity (§7.5.1). The next subsection deals with the special case
of [17, Theorem 3], where M is the manifold of inner products on a vector
space V on which a Lie group G ⊂ SL(V ) acts irreducibly (§7.5.2). If G is
the identity component of the isotropy subgroup of a nonzero vector w ∈ W
under a representation of the special linear group ρ : SL(V ) → SL(W ), then
by [17, Theorem 2] there exists an inner product on V for which the Lie
algebra g of G is symmetric (§7.5.3). This is used in [17, Theorem 1] in
the case where V = g is a simple Lie algebra, w is the Lie bracket, and G
is the identity component of the group of automorphisms of g, to establish
the existence of symmetric inner products on g and deduce various standard
results in Lie algebra theory. These applications to Lie algebra theory are
deferred to the next section.

7.5.1

Convex Functions and The Sphere at Infinity

Assume throughout that M is a Hadamard manifold, i.e. a nonempty, connected, simply connected, complete Riemannian manifold with nonpositive
sectional curvature (Definition 6.5.1). For p ∈ M denote the unit sphere in
the tangent space Tp M by
Sp := {v ∈ Tp M | |v| = 1} .
Their union determines a submanifold SM := {(p, v) | p ∈ M, v ∈ Sp } of the
tangent bundle, called the unit sphere bundle.
Definition 7.5.1. Define an equivalence relation ∼ on SM by
(p, v) ∼ (q, w)

def

⇐⇒

sup d(expp (tv), expq (tw)) < ∞

(7.5.1)

t≥0

for (p, v), (q, w) ∈ SM . The equivalence class of a pair (p, v) ∈ SM will be
denoted by [p, v] := {(q, w) ∈ SM | (q, w) ∼ (p, v)} and the quotient space

S∞ (M ) := SM/∼ = [p, v] (p, v) ∈ SM
is called the sphere at infinity of M .

The following lemma shows that the map Sp → S∞ (M ) : v 7→ [p, v] is
a homeomorphism with respect to the quotient topology on S∞ (M ) for
every p ∈ M (see [17, Lemma 3]).

To see this, fix an element v ∈ Sp and define the geodesic γ : R → M
by γ(t) := expp (tv). Define the curve w : R → Tq M by w(t) := exp−1
q (γ(t))
for t ∈ R. Then FR,q,p (v) = w(R)/|w(R)| and hence

(7.5.7)

Next we use the expanding property of the exponential map in Theorem 6.5.2
twice, namely first the inequality for the derivative in part (ii) at the point q
and then the inequality in part (iii) at the point γ(R) (see Figure 7.1).
Define the tangent vectors vp , vq ∈ Tγ(R) M by
vp := −γ̇(R) = − d expq (w(R))ẇ(R),
vq := −

d
expq (tw(R)/R) = −d expq (w(R))w(R)/R.
dt t=R

Then Theorem 6.5.2 yields the estimate
|ẇ(R) − w(R)/R| ≤ |d expq (w(R))(ẇ(R) − w(R)/R)| = |vp − vq |. (7.5.8)
Also, expγ(R) (svp ) = expp ((R − s)v), expγ(R) (svq ) = expq ((R − s)w(R)/R).
Take s = R − t and use Lemma 6.5.5 to obtain, for 0 ≤ t < R,

Since d(p, γ(R)) = R and d(q, γ(R)) = |w(R)|, the triangle inequality yields
R − d(p, q) ≤ |w(R)| ≤ R + d(p, q).

Combinig the inequalities (7.5.7), (7.5.8), (7.5.9), and (7.5.10) we find that

It follows from (7.5.6) by integrating from a fixed number R > d(p, q)
to infinity that the maps FR,q,p : Sp → Sq converge to a map Fq,p : Sp → Sq
as R tends to infinity and that


sup |Fq,p (v) − FR,q,p (v)| ≤

R − d(p, q)
v∈Sp

for all R > d(p, q). Thus the convergence is uniform and hence the limit
map Fq,p is continuous.
Next we prove (7.5.3). Let p, q ∈ M and v ∈ Sp . Then
w(R)
w(R)
= lim
.
R→∞ |w(R)|
R→∞ R

w := Fq,p (v) = lim FR,q,p (v) = lim
R→∞

Here the third equality follows from (7.5.5) and the definition of the vector w(R) = exp−1
q (expp (Rv)), and the last equality follows from (7.5.10).
Hence expq (tw) = limR→∞ expq (tw(R)/R), and so it follows from (7.5.9) by
taking the limit R → ∞ that d(expp (tv), expq (tw)) ≤ d(p, q) for all t ≥ 0.
This proves “ =⇒ ” in (7.5.3). The converse implication follows from the
fact that, by Theorem 6.5.2, there can be at most one tangent vector w ∈ Sq
satisfying supt>0 d(expp (tv), expp (tw)) < ∞. Thus we have proved that the
maps Fq,p : Sp → Sq in (7.5.2) satisfy (7.5.3). That they also satisfy (7.5.4)
follows directly from (7.5.3) and the fact that (7.5.1) defines an equivalence
relation on SM . Hence each map Fq,p : Sp → Sq is a homeomorphism with
the inverse Fp,q : Sq → Sp and this proves Lemma 7.5.2.
Lemma 7.5.3. If ϕ ∈ I(M ), p, q ∈ M , and v ∈ Sp , then
Fϕ(q),ϕ(p) ◦ dϕ(p) = dϕ(q) ◦ Fq,p : Sp → Sϕ(q) .

(7.5.11)

Thus the group of isometries of M acts continuously on the sphere at infinity
via I(M ) × S∞ (M ) → S∞ (M ) : (ϕ, [p, v]) 7→ ϕ∗ [p, v] := [ϕ(p), dϕ(p)v].
Proof. Since ϕ is an isometry it satisfies ϕ ◦ expq = expϕ(q) ◦dϕ(q) for
all q ∈ M by Corollary 5.3.3. Hence

Divide by the norm and take the limit R → ∞ to obtain (7.5.11). This
proves Lemma 7.5.3.

372

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Definition 7.5.4. Let G ⊂ GL(n, R) be a Lie group. A G-action on M
by isometries is a Lie group homomorphism
G → I(M ) : g 7→ ϕg ,
i.e. the map G × M → M : (g, p) 7→ ϕg (p) is a smooth group action (Definition 2.5.40) and the map ϕg : M → M is an isometry for each g ∈ G. In
this situation we say that the G action has a fixed point iff there exists an
element p ∈ M such that
ϕg (p) = p
for all g ∈ G. We say that the G-action has a fixed point at infinity iff
the induced G-action on the sphere at infinity has a fixed point, i.e. there
exist elements p ∈ M and v ∈ Sp such that
dϕg (p)v = Fϕg (p),p (v)
for all g ∈ G. If such a pair (p, v) ∈ S(M ) does not exist, we say that the Gaction has no fixed point at infinity.
Definition 7.5.5. A smooth function f : M → R is called convex iff the
function f ◦ γ : R → R is convex for every geodesic γ : R → M .
With these preparations in place we are ready to state the following existence theorem for critical points of a convex function (see [17, Theorem 4]).
Theorem 7.5.6 (Donaldson). Let M be a Hadamard manifold equipped
with a smooth action G → I(M ) : g 7→ ϕg of a Lie group G by isometries,
let K be a compact subgroup of G, and let f : M → R be a convex function
such that
f ◦ ϕg = f
for all g ∈ G. Assume that the G-action has no fixed point at infinity. Then
there exists an element p0 ∈ M such that
f (p0 ) = inf f (p),
p∈M

ϕu (p0 ) = p0

for all u ∈ K.

(7.5.12)

As pointed out in [17], similar results can be found in the works of
Bishop–O’Neill [7] and Bridson–Haefliger [11, Lemma 8.26]. We remark
that the compactness of the subgroup K ⊂ G is only needed for an appeal to
Cartan’s Fixed Point Theorem 6.5.6. If we assume instead that the action
of K on M has a fixed point, compactness is not required. The proof of
Theorem 7.5.6 is based in the following lemma (see [17, Lemma 5]).

7.5. CONVEX FUNCTIONS ON HADAMARD MANIFOLDS*

373

Lemma 7.5.7. Let pi be a sequence in M such that limi→∞ d(p, pi ) = ∞
for some (and hence every) p ∈ M . Let I ⊂ I(M ) be a collection of
isometries of M such that supi d(pi , ϕ(pi )) < ∞ for all ϕ ∈ I. Then the
isometries in I have a common fixed point at infinity, i.e. there exists an
element [p, v] ∈ S∞ (M ) such that ϕ∗ [p, v] = [p, v] for all ϕ ∈ I.
Proof. Fix an element p ∈ M and define
vi :=

exp−1
p (pi )
,
Ri

Ri := |exp−1
p (pi )| = d(p, pi ),

(7.5.13)

for each i ∈ N such that pi ̸= p. Passing to a subsequence, if necessary, we
may assume that pi ̸= p for all i ∈ N and that the limit v := limi→∞ vi ∈ Sp
exists. We will prove that dϕ(p)v = Fϕ(p),p (v) for all ϕ ∈ I. To see this,
let ϕ ∈ I, choose c > 0 such that d(pi , ϕ(pi )) ≤ c for all i, and define
vi′ :=

exp−1
p (ϕ(pi ))
,
Ri′

Ri′ := |exp−1
p (ϕ(pi ))| = d(p, ϕ(pi )).

Since expp (Ri′ vi′ ) = ϕ(pi ) and expp (Ri vi ) = pi , Theorem 6.5.2 asserts that
|Ri vi − Ri′ vi′ | ≤ d(pi , ϕ(pi )) ≤ c
for all i. Since |Ri − Ri′ | ≤ c by the triangle inequality, it follows that
|vi − vi′ | ≤

2c
Ri

and hence
lim Ri′ = ∞,

i→∞

lim vi′ = lim vi = v.

i→∞

i→∞

Since expp (Ri′ vi′ ) = ϕ(pi ), this implies

dϕ(p) exp−1
p (pi )

Hence ϕ∗ [p, v] = [p, v] for all ϕ ∈ I and this proves Lemma 7.5.7.

374

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

The next step in the proof of Theorem 7.5.6 is to examine the gradient
flow of the convex function f : M → R. The flow equation has the form
γ̇(t) = −∇f (γ(t)),

(7.5.14)

where the gradient vector field is defined by ⟨∇f (p), v⟩ := df (p)v for p ∈ M
and v ∈ Tp M . An important consequence of convexity is that the distance
between any two solutions of the gradient flow equation is nonincreasing.
This is the content of the next lemma (see [17, Lemma 6]).
Lemma 7.5.8. Let f : M → R be a smooth function. Then f is convex if
and only if it satisfies the condition
⟨∇v ∇f (p), v⟩ ≥ 0

(7.5.15)

for all p ∈ M and all v ∈ Tp M . If f is convex, then the following holds.
(i) Equation (7.5.14) has a solution γ : [0, ∞) → M on the entire positive
real axis for every initial condition γ(0) = p0 .
(ii) Let γ0 : [0, ∞) → M and γ1 : [0, ∞) → M be two solutions of (7.5.14).
Then the function [0, ∞) → R : t 7→ d(t) := d(γ0 (t), γ1 (t)) is nonincreasing.
Proof. Let γ : R → M be a geodesic. Then f ◦ γ : R → R is convex if and
only if

f (γ(t)) =

for all t. This holds for all geodesics if and only if f satisfies (7.5.15). In the
remainder of the proof we assume that f is convex.
Let p0 ∈ M and for T > 0 define
KT := {p ∈ M | d(p0 , p) ≤ T |∇f (p0 )|} .
This set is compact because M is complete. Now let γ : [0, T ) → M be the
solution of (7.5.14) with γ(0) = p0 on some time interval [0, T ). Then
d
|∇f (γ)|2 = 2 ⟨∇γ̇ ∇f (γ), ∇f (γ)⟩ = −2 ⟨∇γ̇ ∇f (γ), γ̇⟩ ≤ 0
dt
by (7.5.15). Thus the function t 7→ |∇f (γ(t))| = |γ̇(t)| is nonincreasing and
so γ(t) ∈ KT for 0 ≤ t < T . Since KT is a compact subset of M , the
solution γ extends to a longer time interval [0, T + δ) for some δ > 0 by
Corollary 2.4.15. Since T > 0 was chosen arbitrary, this proves (i).

7.5. CONVEX FUNCTIONS ON HADAMARD MANIFOLDS*

We prove part (ii). Assume without loss of generality that γ0 (0) ̸= γ1 (0)
and so γ0 (t) ̸= γ1 (t) for all t. For t ≥ 0 let [0, 1] → M : s 7→ γ(s, t)
be the unique geodesic that satisfies γ(0, t) = γ0 (t) and γ(1, t) = γ1 (t).
Then d(t) = d(γ0 (t), γ1 (t)) = L(γ(·, t)) = |∂s γ(s, t)| for all s, t and hence

by (7.5.15). This proves (ii) and Lemma 7.5.8.
Lemma 7.5.9. Let f : M → R be a convex function that has a critical
point p∞ . Then f (p) ≥ f (p∞ ) =: c for all p ∈ M , and the set Cf := f −1 (c)
of minima of f is geodesically convex.
Proof. Let p ∈ M and let γ : [0, 1] → M be the unique geodesic with the
endpoints γ(0) = p∞ and γ(1) = p. Then β := f ◦ γ : [0, 1] → R is a convex
function satisfying β(0) = f (p∞ ) = c and β̇(0) = 0, hence β(t) ≥ c for all t,
and so f (p) = β(1) ≥ c. Thus f attains its minimum at p∞ .
Now let p0 , p1 ∈ Cf and let γ : [0, 1] → M be the unique geodesic with the
endpoints γ(0) = p0 and γ(1) = p1 . Then the function β := f ◦ γ : [0, 1] → R
is convex, satisfies β(0) = β(1) = c, and takes values in the interval [c, ∞).
Hence β ≡ c and so γ(t) ∈ Cf for all t. This proves Lemma 7.5.9.
Proof of Theorem 7.5.6. Choose an element p0 ∈ M and let γ : [0, ∞) → M
be the unique solution of equation (7.5.14) that satisfies the initial condition γ(0) = p0 . Assume first that
sup d(p0 , γ(t)) = ∞

(7.5.16)

t≥0

and choose a sequence ti → ∞ such that limi→∞ d(p0 , γ(ti )) = ∞. Now
let g ∈ G. Since ϕg : M → M is an isometry and f ◦ ϕg = f , it follows
that dϕg (p)∇f (p) = ∇f (ϕg (p)) for all p ∈ M (Exercise: Prove this.) Hence
the curve [0, ∞) → M : t 7→ ϕg (γ(t)) is another solution of equation (7.5.14)
and hence d(γ(ti ), ϕg (γ(ti ))) ≤ d(p0 , ϕg (p0 )) for all i and all g ∈ G by part (ii)
of Lemma 7.5.8. Hence Lemma 7.5.7 asserts that there exists a (p, v) ∈ SM
such that dϕg (p)v = Fϕg (p),p (v) for all g ∈ G, in contracdiction to our assumption that the G-action has no fixed point at infinity.

376

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY
This shows that our assumption (7.5.16) must have been wrong. Thus
sup d(p0 , γ(t)) =: R < ∞,
t≥0

and so our solution γ : [0, ∞) → M of (7.5.14) takes values in the compact
set B := {p ∈ M | d(p0 , p) ≤ R}. Since the function t 7→ f (γ(t)) is nonincreasing, this implies that the limit
c := lim f (γ(t)) ≥ min f (p)
t→∞

p∈B

(7.5.17)

d
f (γ(t)) = −|∇f (γ(t))|2
exists and is a real number (and not −∞). Since dt
and the function t 7→ f (γ(t)) is bounded below by c, there must exist a
sequence ti → ∞ such that

lim ∇f (γ(ti )) = 0.

i→∞

(7.5.18)

Since γ(ti ) ∈ B for all i, we may also assume that the limit
p∞ := lim γ(ti )
i→∞

(7.5.19)

exists (after passing to a subsequence, if necessary). This limit is a critical
point of f by (7.5.18), and f (p∞ ) = c by (7.5.17). Hence, by Lemma 7.5.9, f
attains its minimum at p∞ and the set Cf := {p ∈ M | f (p) = c} of minima
of f is geodesically convex. We must find an element of Cf that is fixed
under the action of K. By Cartan’s Fixed Point Theorem 6.5.6 there exists
a q ∈ M such that ϕu (q) = q for all u ∈ K. Since M is complete and Cf is
a nonempty closed subset of M , there exists an element p0 ∈ Cf such that
d(q, p0 ) = inf d(q, p) =: δ.
p∈Cf

(7.5.20)

We claim that ϕu (p0 ) = p0 for all u ∈ K. To see this, fix an element u ∈ K,
let γ : [0, 1] → M be the geodesic joining γ(0) = p0 to γ(1) = ϕu (p0 ), and
denote by m := γ(1/2) the midpoint of this geodesic. Then Lemma 6.5.7
asserts that
2d(q, m)2 +

d(p0 , ϕu (p0 ))2
≤ d(q, p0 )2 + d(q, ϕu (p0 ))2 .
2

(7.5.21)

Since ϕu (q) = q and ϕu is an isometry, we have d(q, ϕu (p0 )) = d(q, p0 ) = δ,
and since Cf is geodesically convex, we have m ∈ Cf and so d(q, m) ≥ δ.
Hence it follows from (7.5.21) that p0 = ϕu (p0 ). This shows that p0 ∈ Cf is
a fixed point for the action of K on M and proves Theoren 7.5.6.

7.5. CONVEX FUNCTIONS ON HADAMARD MANIFOLDS*

377

Example 7.5.10. To illustrate the argument in the proof of Theorem 7.5.6,
take M = C with the standard flat metric. Then the equivalence relation
on the sphere bundle SM = C × S 1 is given by translation in C and so the
sphere at infinity is S∞ (M ) = S 1 . The orthogonal group G = O(2) acts by
isometries on M and has no fixed point at infinity. The subgroup K = Z/2Z
acts by complex conjugation and its fixed point set is the real axis. Choose
a smooth convex function h : R → R that vanishes on the interval [−1, 1]
and is positive elsewhere. Then the function f (z) := h(|z|) is convex and Ginvariant and the set Cf of minima of f is the closed unit disc in C. If q = 2
is the fixed point of the K-action chosen in the proof, then p0 = 1 ∈ Cf .
If G = K = Z/2Z, then ±1 are the fixed points at infinity and f (z) := eRe(z)
is convex and G-invariant, but does not take on its infimum.
Example 7.5.11 ([17]). Consider the case where M = Dm is the Poincaré
model of hyperbolic space (Exercise 6.4.22). Then the sphere at infinity
is the boundary ∂Dm = S m−1 (Exercise 6.4.24). If the convex function f
extends continuously to the closed ball and does not take on its minimum
in M , then it attains its minimum at a unique point on the boundary,
because any two boundary points are the asymptotic limits of a geodesic
in M . Hence the minimum on the boundary is fixed under the action of any
Lie group on M by isometries, that leave f invariant. This is reminiscent of
the Kempf Uniqueness Theorem in GIT (see [37] and [20, Theorem 10.2]),
where M = G/K is associated to the complexification G of a compact Lie
group K and f is the Kempf–Ness function (see [38, 53] and [20, §4]).

7.5.2

Inner Products and Weighted Flags

We will now turn to a specific example, where the Hadamard manifold is the
space of positive definite symmetric matrices with determinant one (§6.5.3).
Following [17], we choose a finite-dimensional real vector space V equipped
with a fixed inner product ⟨·, ·⟩. Then every inner product on V has the
form ⟨v, v ′ ⟩P := ⟨v, P −1 v ′ ⟩ for some self-adjoint positive definite automorphism P . Denote the set of such automorphisms with determinant one by

P0 (V ) := P ∈ End(V ) P ∗ = P > 0, det(P ) = 1 .
(7.5.22)
Here P ∗ ∈ End(V ) is defined by ⟨v, P ∗ v ′ ⟩ := ⟨P v, v ′ ⟩ for v, v ′ ∈ V , and the
notation “P > 0” means ⟨v, P v⟩ > 0 for all v ∈ V \ {0}. Thus P0 (V ) is a
codimension-1 submanifold of the space of self-adjoint endomorphisms of V .
Its tangent space at P ∈ P0 (V ) is given by


TP P0 (V ) := Pb ∈ End(V ) Pb = Pb∗ , trace PbP −1 = 0 .

(7.5.24)

for P ∈ P0 (V ) and Pb ∈ TP P0 (V ) as in §6.5.3, and so P0 (V ) is a Hadamard
manifold by Theorem 6.5.10. For Pb ∈ TP P0 (V ) the endomorphism PbP −1
is self-adjoint with respect to the inner product ⟨·, P −1 ·⟩ on V .
The group SL(V ) ⊂ GL(V ) of automorphisms of V with determinant
one acts on P0 (V ) by the isometries ϕg (P ) := gP g ∗ for g ∈ SL(V ). The
isotropy subgroup of 1l ∈ P0 (V ) is the special orthogonal group SO(V ).
The action of a subgroup G ⊂ SL(V ) on V is called irreducible iff there
does not exist a linear subspace E ⊂ V , other than E = {0} and E = V ,
such that gE = E for all g ∈ G. This notion can be used to carry over the
general existence theorem in §7.5.1 for critical points of a convex function
to the present setting (see [17, Theorem 3]).
Theorem 7.5.12 (Donaldson). Let G ⊂ SL(V ) be a Lie subgroup such
that the action of G on V is irreducible. Let K ⊂ G be a compact subgroup
and let f : P0 (V ) → R be a convex function such that f (gP g ∗ ) = f (P ) for
all g ∈ G and all P ∈ P0 (V ). Then there exists a P0 ∈ P0 (V ) such that
f (P0 ) =

The goal will be to deduce Theorem 7.5.12 from Theorem 7.5.6. Thus
we must understand the sphere at infinity of the space P0 (V ). This will be
accomplished with the help of the following definition.
Definition 7.5.13. A weighted flag in V is a pair (F, µ), where F is a
finite sequence of linear suspaces
{0} = F0 ⊂ F1 ⊂ F2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fr = V
such that ni := dim(Fi )/ dim(Fi−1 ) > 0 for i = 1, . . . , r, and µ is a finite
sequence of real numbers µ1 > µ2 > · · · > µr satisfying the conditions

Let F = F (V ) be the set of weighted flags. The group SL(V ) acts on F (V )
by g · (F, µ) := (gFi , µi )i for (F, µ) = (Fi , µi )i ∈ F (V ) and g ∈ SL(V ).

For P ∈ P0 (V ) the unit sphere in the tangent space TP P0 (V ) is the set



SP := Pb = Pb∗ ∈ End(V ) trace PbP −1 = 0, trace PbP −1 PbP −1 = 1 .
Let P ∈ P0 (V ) and Pb ∈ SP . Then the endomorphism PbP −1 is self-adjoint
with respect to the inner product ⟨·, P −1 ·⟩ and hence has only real eigenvalues µ1 > µ2 > · · · > µr . For each i let Ei⊂ V be the eigenspace for µi and
define ni := dim(Ei ). Since trace PbP −1 = 0 and trace PbP −1 PbP −1 = 1,
the µi , ni satisfy (7.5.26). The weighted flag of (P, Pb) is defined by

ιP (Pb) := (F, µ) = (F1 , µ1 ), . . . , (Fr , µr ) ∈ F (V ),
(7.5.27)
where Fi := E1 ⊕ E2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ei for i = 1, . . . , r. For each P ∈ P0 (V ) the
map ιP : SP → F (V ) defined by (7.5.27) is bijective, and thus induces
a (compact, metrizable) topology on F (V ). This topology is independent
of P as the next lemma shows. The lemma also shows that the space of
weighted flags is the sphere at infinity (see [17, Lemma 4]).
Lemma 7.5.14. The equivalence relation in Definition 7.5.1 on the unit
sphere bundle SP0 (V ) is given by
b
(P, Pb) ∼ (Q, Q)

⇐⇒

b
ιP (Pb) = ιQ (Q)

(7.5.28)

b ∈ SQ . Thus the map FQ,P : SP → SQ
for P, Q ∈ P0 (V ), Pb ∈ SP , and Q
as defined in Lemma 7.5.2 is given by FQ,P = ιQ ◦ ι−1
P . Moreover, the
b
b
map SP0 (V ) → F (V ) : (P, P ) 7→ ιp (P ) is SL(V )-equivariant, i.e.
ιgP g∗ (g Pbg ∗ ) = g · ιP (Pb)

(7.5.29)

for all P ∈ P0 (V ), all Pb ∈ SP , and all g ∈ SL(V ).
Proof. Since (g Pbg ∗ )(gP g ∗ )−1 = g(PbP −1 )g −1 for all Pb ∈ SP and g ∈ SL(V ),
equation (7.5.29) follows directly from the definitions. The proof that the
equivalence relation satisfies (7.5.28) rests on the following claims.
Claim 1. Let S ∈ S1l , let (Fi , µi )ri=1 = ι1l (S) be the flag associated to S,
and let h ∈ SL(V ) be an automorphism of V with determinant one such that
hFi = Fi

for i = 1, . . . , r.

(7.5.30)

Then (1l, S) ∼ (hh∗ , hSh∗ ).
Claim 2. Let g ∈ SL(V ) and fix any flag {0} = F0 ⊊ F1 ⊊ · · · ⊊ Fr = V .
Then there exist elements h ∈ SL(V ) and u ∈ SO(V ) such that h satisfies (7.5.30) and g = hu.

380

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

We prove, that these two claims imply (7.5.28). Fix any element S ∈ S1l ,
let (Fi , µi )ri=1 = ι1l (S) be the weighted flag of S, and let P ∈ P0 (V ). Choose
an element g ∈ SL(V ) such that gg ∗ = P , and choose u and h as in Claim 2.
Then hh∗ = P , and the pairs (P, Pb) := (hh∗ , hSh∗ ) and (1l, S) have the
same flag by (7.5.30) and are equivalent by Claim 1. Hence any pair (P, Pb)
is equivalent to (1l, S) if and only if it has the same flag. By transitivity of
the equivalence relation we deduce that (7.5.28) holds for all P, Q ∈ P0 (V ).
We prove Claim 2. Let Fi′ := g −1 Fi and mi := dim(Fi ) for i = 1, . . . , r.
Then choose orthonormal bases e1 , . . . , em and e′1 , . . . , e′m of V such that for,
each i, the vectors e1 , . . . , emi form a basis of Fi and the vectors e′1 , . . . , e′mi
form a basis of Fi′ . Define the orthogonal transformation u by ue′i := ei
for i = 1, . . . , m. It satisfies Fi′ = u−1 Fi and hence gu−1 Fi = Fi for all i.
Thus h := gu−1 satisfies the requirements of Claim 2.
We prove Claim 1, following [17, Lemma 4]. Define the geodesics γ0 , γ1
in P0 (V ) by γ0 (t) = exp(tS) and γ1 (t) = h exp(tS)h∗ (see Lemma 6.5.18).
By equation (6.5.12) the square of their distance is given by

M (t) := exp −tS/2 h exp tS/2 .
In the eigenspace decomposition V = E1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Er of the self-adjoint endomorphism S the automorphisms h and exp(tS/2) have the form

follows that the limit M∞ := limt→∞ M (t) = diag(h11 , . . . , hrr ) exists and
is an invertible endomorphism of V . Hence the function ρ : [0, ∞) → R
in (7.5.31) is bounded. This proves Claim 1 and Lemma 7.5.14.

Proof of Theorem 7.5.12. Let G ⊂ SL(V ) be a Lie subgroup which acts irreducibly on V . Then G acts on P0 (V ) by isometries. By Lemma 7.5.14
the induced action on the sphere at infinity S∞ (P0 (V )) ∼
= F (V ) is given
by G × F (V ) → F (V ) : (g, (Fi , µi )i=1,...,r ) 7→ (gFi , µi )i=1,...,r . This action
has no fixed points because the action of G on V is irreducible and r ≥ 2
for each weighted flag (Fi , µi )i=1,...,r ∈ F (V ). Hence all the assertions of
Theorem 7.5.12 follow directly from Theorem 7.5.6 with M = P0 (V ).

7.5.3

Lengths of Vectors

The material in this section goes back to ideas in geometric invariant theory
developed by Kempf–Ness [38], Ness [53], and Kirwan [40] in the complex
setting and by Richardson–Slodowy [59] and Marian [48] in the real setting.
We assume throughout that V, W are finite-dimensional real vector spaces
and ρ : SL(V ) → SL(W ) is a Lie group homomorphism. Note that every
Lie group homomorphism from GL(V ) to GL(W ) restricts to a Lie group
homomorphism from SL(V ) to SL(W ), because every Lie group homomorphism from GL(V ) to the multiplicative group of nonzero real numbers is
some power of the determinant.
Fix a nonzero vector w ∈ W and denote by Gw ⊂ SL(V ) the connected
component of the identity in the isotropy subgroup of w, i.e.


∃ a smooth path γ : [0, 1] → SL(V ) 

Gw := g ∈ SL(V ) such that γ(0) = 1l, γ(1) = g, and
. (7.5.34)


ρ(γ(t))w = w for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1
By Theorem 2.5.27 this is a Lie subgroup of SL(V ) with the Lie algebra

gw := ξ ∈ sl(V ) ρ̇(ξ)w = 0 .
There are many examples of this setup that are related to interesting questions in geometry. The vector space W can be the space of all symmetric
bilinear forms on V and w can be an inner product, in which case Gw is
the special orthogonal group associated to the inner product, or w can be
the quadratic form (6.4.9), in which case Gw is the identity component of
the isometry group of hyperbolic space. Or W can be the space of skewsymmetric bilinear forms on V and w a symplectic form, in which case Gw
is the symplectic linear group. Or W can be the space of skew-symmetric
bilinear maps on V with values in V . Then w can be a cross product in
dimension three or seven, or w can be the Lie bracket of a Lie algebra g = V
and then Gw is the identity component in the group of automorphisms of g.
The latter example will be examined in detail in §7.6.2. Of particular interest are the cases where the group Gw is noncompact.

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Definition 7.5.15. An inner product ⟨·, ·⟩ on V is called (ρ, w)-symmetric
iff the Lie subalgebra gw ⊂ sl(V ) is invariant under the involution A 7→ A∗ ,
defined by ⟨v, A∗ v ′ ⟩ := ⟨Av, v ′ ⟩ for v, v ′ ∈ V .
Exercise 7.5.16. Let ⟨·, ·⟩ be a (ρ, w)-symmetric inner product on V . Prove
that g ∈ Gw implies g ∗ ∈ Gw . Hint: Choose a smooth path g : [0, 1] → Gw
with the endpoints g(0) = 1l and g(1) = g, and define ξ(t) := g(t)−1 ġ(t).
Show that the initial value problem ḣ(t) = ξ(t)∗ h(t), h(0) = 1, has a unique
solution h : [0, 1] → Gw (Exercise 2.5.36) and that h(t) = g(t)∗ for all t.
The following theorem asserts the existence of a (ρ, w)-symmetric inner
product on V under an irreducibility assumption (see [17, Theorem 2]).
Theorem 7.5.17. Assume that the group Gw in (7.5.34) acts irreducibly
on V . Then there exists a (ρ, w)-symmetric inner product on V with the
following properties. The subgroup
Kw := Gw ∩ SO(V )
is connected and is a maximal compact subgroup of Gw . Moreover, every
compact subgroup of Gw is conjugate in Gw to a Lie subgroup of Kw . Thus,
if K is any maximal compact subgroup of Gw , there exists an element h ∈ Gw
such that K = hKw h−1 .
Proof. See Lemma 7.5.23.
Example 7.5.18. The hypothesis that the group Gw acts irreducibly on V
cannot be removed in Theorem 7.5.17. Consider the case where W = V
has dimension at least two, the homomorphism ρ : SL(V ) → SL(V ) is the
identity, and w ∈ V is any nonzero vector. Then the one-dimensional linear
subspace Rw ⊂ V is evidently invariant under the action of Gw , and there
does not exist any (ρ, w)-symmetric inner product on V .
To begin with, we will fix any inner product ⟨·, ·⟩V on V and define
the space P0 (V ) of self-adjoint positive definite automorphisms of V with
determinant one in terms of this fixed inner product. We will then use
Theorem 7.5.12 to find an element P ∈ P0 (V ) such that the inner product
v, v ′ V,P := v, P −1 v ′ V

(7.5.35)

on V satisfies the requirements of Theorem 7.5.17. The proof is based on
three lemmas. The fourth lemma restates the theorem in a modified form.

7.5. CONVEX FUNCTIONS ON HADAMARD MANIFOLDS*

Lemma 7.5.19. There exists an inner product ⟨·, ·⟩W on W such that
ρ(SO(V )) ⊂ SO(W ) and ρ̇(A∗ ) = ρ̇(A)∗ for all A ∈ sl(V ).
Proof. The proof follows the argument in [17, §3]. Assume without loss
of generality that V = Rm is equipped with the standard inner product,
and that W = Rn and that ρ : SL(m, R) → SL(n, R) is a Lie group homomorphism. We prove first that there exists a unique Lie group homomorphism ρc : SL(m, C) → SL(n, C) (the complexification of ρ) such that
ρc |SL(m,R) = ρ,

ρ̇c (A + iB) = ρ̇(A) + iρ̇(B)

(7.5.36)

for all A, B ∈ sl(m, R). Since SL(m, C) is connected, we can define ρc (g)
for g ∈ GL(m, C) by choosing a smoth path α : [0, 1] → SL(m, C) with the
endpoints α(0) = 1lm and α(1) = g, and taking

ρc (g) := β(1),
β(s)−1 β̇(s) = ρ̇c α(s)−1 α̇(s) ,
β(0) = 1ln . (7.5.37)
To verify that β(1) is independent of the choice of α, one can choose a smooth
map [0, 1]2 → SL(m, C) : (s, t) 7→ α(s, t) satisfying α(0, t) = 1lm , α(1, t) = g,
define S := α−1 ∂s α and T := α−1 ∂t α, and define β : [0, 1]2 → SL(n, C)
as the solution of the initial value problem β −1 ∂s β = ρ̇c (S), β(0, t) = 1ln .
Since ρ̇c is a Lie algebra homomorphism and ∂t S − ∂s T = [S, T ], it follows
that β −1 ∂t β = ρ̇c (T ) and so β(1, t) is independent of t. Moreover, SL(m, C)
retracts onto SU(m) by polar decomposition and so is simply connected by a
standard homotopy argument. That the map ρc : SL(m, C) → SL(n, C) thus
defined is smooth follows from the smooth dependence of solutions on the
parameter in a smooth family of differential equations. That it is a group
homomorphism follows by catenation of paths, and that it satisfies (7.5.36)
follows directly from the definition.
Now consider the action of the compact subgroup SU(m) ⊂ SL(m, C) on
the Hadamard manifold Q0 of positive definite Hermitian n × n-matrices Q
of determinant one (Remark 6.5.21) by (g, Q) 7→ ρc (g)Qρc (g)∗ . This action
is by isometries and hence, by Cartan’s Fixed Point Theorem 6.5.6, there
exists an element Q0 ∈ Q0 such that ρc (g)Q0 ρc (g)∗ = Q0 for all g ∈ SU(m).
Differentiate this equation at g = 1lm to obtain ρ̇c (B)Q0 + Q0 ρ̇c (B)∗ = 0 for
every skew-Hermitian matrix B = −B ∗ ∈ sl(m, C) with trace zero. Now
let A ∈ sl(m, R), define R := 21 (A − AT ), S := 12 (A + AT ), and take B = R
and B = iS. Then ρ̇(R)Q0 + Q0 ρ̇(R)T = 0 and ρ̇(S)Q0 = Q0 ρ̇(S)T . Hence
the positive definite symmetric n × n-matrix Q := Re(Q0 ) satisfies


ρ̇ AT = ρ̇ −R + S = Qρ̇(R + S)T Q−1 = Qρ̇(A)T Q−1
for all A ∈ sl(m, R). This shows that the inner product ⟨w, w′ ⟩ := wT Q−1 w′
on Rn satisfies the requirements of Lemma 7.5.19.

384

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

In the remainder of this subsection we will fix an inner product on W
as in Lemma 7.5.19. Recall also that we have already chosen a nonzero
vector w ∈ W . The norm squared of this vector determines a function on
the space of inner products on V (see [17, Lemma 1]).
Lemma 7.5.20. Define the function fw : P0 (V ) → R by
fw (P ) = w, ρ(P −1 )w W

(7.5.38)

for P ∈ P0 (V ). Then an element P ∈ P0 (V ) is a critical point of fw if
and only if ⟨ρ̇(A)w, ρ(P −1 )w⟩W = 0 for all A ∈ sl(V ). Moreover, if P is a
critical point of fw , then the inner product (7.5.35) on V is (ρ, w)-symmetric.
Proof. Fix an element P ∈ P0 (V ) and a tangent vector Pb ∈ Tp P0 (V ).
Then it follows from Lemma 7.5.19 that

dfw (P )Pb = − w, ρ̇(P −1 Pb)ρ(P −1 )w
D

W

Now let A ∈ sl(V ) and take Pb := AP + P A∗ to obtain
dfw (P )(AP + P A∗ ) = − ρ̇(A + P A∗ P −1 )w, ρ(P −1 )w W
= −2 ρ̇(A)w, ρ(P −1 )w W .

(7.5.39)

Thus P is a critical point of fw if and only if the right hand side of (7.5.39)
vanishes for all A ∈ sl(V ). To prove the last assertion, define the norm
p
|w′ |W,P := ⟨w′ , ρ(P −1 )w′ ⟩W
for w′ ∈ W . Now let P ∈ P0 (g) be a critical point of fw , let ξ ∈ sl(V ), and
take A := [ξ, P ξ ∗ P −1 ] ∈ sl(V ) in (7.5.39). Then
0 = ρ̇([ξ, P ξ ∗ P −1 ])w, ρ(P −1 )w W = |ρ̇(P ξ ∗ P −1 )w|2W,P − |ρ̇(ξ)w|2W,P .
If ξ ∈ gw , then ρ̇(ξ)w = 0, hence ρ̇(P ξ ∗ P −1 )w = 0, and hence P ξ ∗ P −1 ∈ gw .
But the endomorphism P ξ ∗ P −1 is the adjoint of ξ with respect to the inner
product (7.5.35) on V and this proves Lemma 7.5.20.
Example 7.5.21. This example shows that the (ρ, w)-symmetry of the
inner product (7.5.35) does not imply that P is a critical point of fw .
Take W = V × V and let ρ : SL(V ) → SL(W ) be the diagonal action. Assume dim(V ) = 2 and choose w = (u, v) ∈ W such that u, v ∈ V are linearly
independent. Then Gw = {1l} and so every inner product on V is (ρ, w)symmetric (and the assertions of Theorem 7.5.17 are satisfied), however, the
function fw (P ) = ⟨u, P −1 u⟩V + ⟨v, P −1 v⟩V does not have any critical point.

7.5. CONVEX FUNCTIONS ON HADAMARD MANIFOLDS*

Let Mw ⊂ P0 (V ) be the set of minima of the function fw : P0 (V ) → R
in Lemma 7.5.20 and let Crit(fw ) ⊂ P0 (V ) be its set of critical points. The
next result shows that fw is convex and that Gw acts transitively on Mw
whenever this set is nonempty (see [17, Lemma 2]).
Lemma 7.5.22. The function fw has the following properties.
(i) fw is convex and Gw -invariant, and thus Mw = Crit(fw ).
(ii) Fix two elements P0 ∈ Mw and P ∈ P0 (V ). Then P ∈ Mw if and only if
there exists an element η ∈ gw such that η = P0 η ∗ P0−1 and exp(η) = P P0−1 ,
or equivalently ρ(P P0−1 )w = w.
(iii) The group Gw acts transitively on Mw .
Proof. We prove part (i). Let γ : R → P0 (V ) be a geodesic and define
P := γ(0),

Pb := γ̇(0),

S := P −1/2 PbP −1/2 .

Then, by Lemma 6.5.18, γ(t) = P 1/2 exp(tS)P 1/2 and hence
fw (γ(t)) = ⟨ρ(P −1/2 )w, exp(−tρ̇(S))ρ(P −1/2 )w⟩W .
This implies
d2
fw (γ(t)) = ⟨ρ̇(S)ρ(P −1/2 )w, exp(−tρ̇(S))ρ̇(S)ρ(P −1/2 )w⟩W ≥ 0
dt2
for all t and hence fw is convex. Hence Mw = Crit(fw ) by Lemma 7.5.9.
That fw is Gw -invariant follows directly from the definition. This proves (i).
We prove part (ii). If η ∈ gw satisfies η = P0 η ∗ P0−1 , exp(η) = P P0−1 ,
then ρ(P P0−1 )w = w. If ρ(P P0−1 )w = w, then ρ(P −1 )w = ρ(P0−1 )w, hence
⟨ρ̇(A)w, ρ(P −1 )w⟩W = ⟨ρ̇(A)w, ρ(P0−1 )w⟩W = 0
for all A ∈ sl(V ), and hence P ∈ Mw by Lemma 7.5.20 and part (i). Now
assume P ∈ Mw and let γ : [0, 1] → P0 (V ) be the unique geodesic with the
endpoints γ(0) = P0 and γ(1) = P ∈ Mw . Then γ(t) ∈ Mw for all t by
Lemma 7.5.9. Hence ⟨ρ̇(η)w, ρ(γ(t)−1 )w⟩W = 0 for all t and all η ∈ sl(V ),
by Lemma 7.5.20. Differentiate this equation at t = 0 to obtain
⟨ρ̇(η)w, ρ(P0−1 )ρ̇(PbP0−1 )w⟩W = 0,

Pb := γ̇(0) ∈ TP0 P0 (V ).

Take η := PbP0−1 to obtain ρ̇(η)w = 0, and thus η ∈ gw and η = P0 η ∗ P0−1 .
By Lemma 6.5.18 we also have P = γ(1) = exp(PbP0−1 )P0 = exp(η)P0 and
this proves (ii).
We prove part (iii). Let P0 , P ∈ Mw , choose an element η ∈ gw as in (ii)
so that ηP0 = P0 η ∗ and P = exp(η)P0 , and define h := exp(η/2) ∈ Gw to
obtain P = hP0 h∗ . This proves (iii) and Lemma 7.5.22.

386

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY
With these preparations we are ready to prove Theorem 7.5.17.

Lemma 7.5.23. (i) If Gw acts irreducibly on V , then Mw ̸= ∅.
(ii) If P ∈ Mw , then the inner product ⟨·, P −1 ·⟩V on V satisfies all the
requirements of Theorem 7.5.17.
Proof. The function fw is convex and Gw -invariant by Lemma 7.5.22. Hence
part (i) follows from Theorem 7.5.12. To prove part (ii), assume that P is
a critical point of fw . Then, by Lemma 7.5.20, the inner product ⟨·, P −1 ·⟩V
is (ρ, w)-symmetric. We prove the remaining assertions in four steps. Define

KP := Gw ∩ SO(V, ⟨·, P −1 ·⟩V ) = u ∈ Gw | uP u∗ P −1 = 1l .
Step 1. Let K ⊂ Gw be any compact subgroup. Then there exists an element h ∈ Gw such that h−1 Kh ⊂ KP .
By Theorem 7.5.12, there exists a P0 ∈ P0 (V ) such that fw (P0 ) = inf fw
and uP0 u∗ = P0 for all u ∈ K. By Lemma 7.5.22, there exists an element h ∈ Gw such that P0 = hP h∗ . Hence uhP h∗ u∗ = hP h∗ for all u ∈ K,
and hence the automorphism h−1 uh is orthogonal with respect to the inner
product ⟨·, P −1 ·⟩V for every u ∈ K.
Step 2. KP is a compact connected subgroup of Gw .
By the Closed Subgroup Theorem 2.5.27 KP is a closed, and hence compact,
subgroup of SO(V, ⟨·, P −1 ·⟩V ) and so is a compact Lie subgroup of Gw . We
prove that KP is connected. Let u ∈ KP ⊂ Gw . Since Gw is connected,
there exists a smooth path g : [0, 1] → Gw such that g(0) = 1l and g(1) = u.
Thus, by Exercise 7.5.16, we have g(t)P g(t)∗ P −1 ∈ Gw for all t. Hence, by
part (ii) of Lemma 7.5.22, there exists a smooth path η : [0, 1] → gw such
that η(t) = P η(t)∗ P −1 , exp(η(t)) = g(t)P g(t)∗ P −1 , and η(0) = η(1) = 0.
Hence u(t) := exp(−η(t)/2)g(t) is a path in KP joining u(0) = 1l to u(1) = u.
Step 3. KP is a maximal compact subgroup of Gw .
Let K ⊂ Gw be a compact subgroup containing KP . Then by Step 1 there
exists an h ∈ Gw such that h−1 Kh ⊂ KP . Hence KP ⊂ K ⊂ hKP h−1 and
so Lie(KP ) ⊂ Lie(K) ⊂ hLie(KP )h−1 . Since Lie(KP ) and hLie(KP )h−1
have the same dimension, this implies Lie(KP ) = hLie(KP )h−1 . Since KP
and hKP h−1 are connected, this implies KP = hKP h−1 and so KP = K.
Step 4. Let K be a maximal compact subgroup of Gw . Then there exists an
element h ∈ Gw such that K = hKP h−1 .
By Step 1 there exists an h ∈ Gw such that h−1 Kh ⊂ KP , thus K ⊂ hKP h−1
and so K = hKP h−1 , because K is a maximal compact subgroup of Gw . This
proves Step 4, Lemma 7.5.23, and Theorem 7.5.17.

Lemma 7.5.23 shows that all minima of the function fw in Lemma 7.5.20
give rise to inner products that satisfy the requirements of Theorem 7.5.17.
The next lemma shows that the set of minima of fw is a Hadamard manifold.
Lemma 7.5.24. The set Mw is a geodesically convex and totally geodesic
submanifold of P0 (V ). Hence, if it is nonempty, it is a Hadamard manifold
and a symmetric space.
Proof. By Lemma 7.5.22 the function fw is convex, and so Mw is geodesically convex by Lemma 7.5.9. Now assume Mw is nonempty and fix any
element P0 ∈ Mw . Then the exponential map
TP0 P0 (V ) → P0 (V ) : Pb 7→ exp(PbP0−1 )P0
is a diffeomorphism (Theorem 6.5.10 and Lemma 6.5.18) and Mw is the
image of the linear subspace {Pb ∈ TP0 P0 (g) | PbP0−1 ∈ gw } under this diffeomorphism (Lemma 7.5.22). Since P0 can be chosen to be any element of Mw ,
this shows that Mw is a totally geodesic submanifold of P0 (V ). Moreover,
the isometry P0 (V ) → P0 (V ) : P 7→ ϕ0 (P ) = P0 P −1 P0 in Step 2 of the
proof of Theorem 6.5.10 satisfies


 
ϕ0 exp PbP0−1 P0 = exp −PbP0−1 P0
for all Pb ∈ TP P0 (V ) and so restricts to an isometry of Mw . Hence Mw is a
symmetric space and this proves Lemma 7.5.24.
We emphasize that Lemma 7.5.24 does not require the hypothesis that
the group Gw acts irreducibly on V . This hypothesis was only used to prove
that the space Mw is nonempty. The next example shows that fw can have
critical points in cases where Gw acts reducibly on V .
Example 7.5.25. Let V = R2 , let W = S ⊂ R2×2 be the space of symmetric matrices, equipped with the standard inner product and the standard
action S 7→ gSg T of SL(2, R), and let w = S := diag(1, −1) ∈ S so that

The action of GS on R2 is reducible, because the diagonal in R2 is GS invariant, however, the function fS (P ) = trace(SP −1 SP −1 ) attains its minimum on the set MS = GS ⊂ P0 (R2 ), corresponding to the symmetric inner products on R2 . If one modifies this example by taking W = S × S
and w = (1l, S), then fw (P ) = trace(P −2 + SP −1 SP −1 ) has a unique critical
point at P = 1l, the group Gw = {1l} acts reducibly on V , and the assertions
of Theorem 7.5.17 are trivially satisfied for every inner product on V .

388

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Example 7.5.21 and Example 7.5.25 show that, in general, one cannot
expect there to be a one-to-one correspondence between the minima of fw
and the (ρ, w)-symmetric inner products on V . However, we shall see below
that such a one-to-one correspondence does exist in many cases.
Remark 7.5.26. Once it is known, that the function fw : P0 (V ) → R has
a critical point P0 ∈ P0 (V ), we can modify the entire setup as follows.
Replace the inner product on V by ⟨·, ·⟩V,0 := ⟨·, P0−1 ·⟩V and the inner
product on W by ⟨·, ·⟩W,0 := ⟨·, ρ(P0−1 )·⟩W . This pair of inner products satisfies the requirements of Lemma 7.5.19. Let P00 (V ) be the space of selfadjoint positive definite endomorphisms with respect to the new inner product and define the function fw,0 : P00 (V ) → R by the analogous formula.
Then P ∈ P0 (V ) if and only if P P0−1 ∈ P00 (V ) and fw,0 (P P0−1 ) = fw (P )
for all P ∈ P0 (V ). Thus fw,0 attains its minimum at P = 1l.
In the next corollary we do not assume that Gw acts irreducibly on V .
Corollary 7.5.27 (Cartan Decomposition). Assume the function fw in
Lemma 7.5.20 has a critical point at P0 = 1l and define
Kw := Gw ∩ SO(V ),

pw := {η ∈ gw | η = η ∗ } .

(7.5.40)

Then the map
Kw × pw → Gw : (u, η) 7→ exp(η)u =: ϕw (u, η)

(7.5.41)

√
is a diffeomorphism. Hence the map Gw → P0 (V ) : g 7→ gg ∗ descends to
a diffeomorphism from the quotient space Gw /Kw to Mw = Gw ∩ P0 (V ).
Proof. By part (ii) of Lemma 7.5.22 with P0 = 1l the function fw attains its
minimum on the set Mw = Gw ∩ P0 (g). Now define the map
ψw : Gw → Kw × pw
by ψw (g) := (u, η), where
η := 21 exp−1 (gg ∗ ) ∈ pw ,

u := exp(−η)g ∈ Kw

for g ∈ Gw . This map is well defined and smooth because, for every g ∈ Gw ,
we have gg ∗ ∈ Gw ∩ P0 (V ) = Mw (see Exercise 7.5.16), and the exponential
map descends to a diffeomorphism exp : pw → Mw (see Lemma 7.5.22).
Since ϕw ◦ ψw = id and ψw ◦ ϕw = id, it follows that ϕw is a diffeomorphism.
This proves Corollary 7.5.27.

As a warmup for the main application of Theorem 7.5.17 in §7.6 it may
be useful to consider the following two examples.
Exercise 7.5.28. (i) Let V be an m-dimensional real vector space and
W := S 2 V ∗

that this inner product is independent of the choice of the orthonormal basis
and satisfies the requirements of Lemma 7.5.19.
(ii) The inner product on V is an element Q0 ∈ W whose isotropy subgroup is the special orthogonal group SO(V ). Show that the function fQ0
in (7.5.38) is given by fQ0 (P ) = trace(P 2 ) for P ∈ P0 (V ) and that it has a
unique critical point at P = 1l.
(iii) Examine the case where V = Rm+1 is equipped with the standard inner
product and Q ∈ W is the quadratic form in (6.4.9). Relate this example to
the isometry group of hyperbolic space (§6.4.3). Find a maximal compact
subgroup of the identity component of O(m, 1).
Exercise 7.5.29. (i) Let V be a 2n-dimensional real vector space and
W = Λ2 V ∗

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

(ii) Let ω : V × V → R be a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form.
Then the pair (V, ω) is called a symplectic vector space and ω is called
a symplectic form on V . The isotropy subgroup of ω in GL(V ) is called
the symplectic linear group. Denote this group and its Lie algebra by

Sp(V, ω) := g ∈ GL(V ) ω(g·, g·) = ω ,

sp(V, ω) := Lie(Sp(V, ω)) = A ∈ End(V ) ω(A·, ·) + ω(·, A·) = 0 .
The group Sp(V, ω) is connected and contained in SL(V ) (see [49]). An automorphism J : V → V is called a linear complex structure iff J 2 = −1l.
A linear complex structure J is called compatible with ω iff the bilinear form ω(·, J·) is an inner product on V . An inner product ⟨·, ·⟩ on V is
called compatible with ω iff there exists a linear complex structure J such
that ω(·, J·) = ⟨·, ·⟩. Prove that an inner product on V is compatible with ω
if and only if it satisfies the conditions (for any basis e1 , . . . , e2n of V )

(7.5.43)

If an inner product on V is compatible with ω, prove that g ∈ Sp(V, ω)
implies g ∗ ∈ Sp(V, ω) (without using the fact that Sp(V, ω) is connected).
Hint: Define J ∈ End(V ) by ω(·, J·) := ⟨·, ·⟩ and show that J + J ∗ = 0.
Show that A ∈ sp(V, ω) if and only if AJ + JA∗ = 0. Use (7.5.43) to prove
that J 2 commutes with every self-adjoint endomorphism of V and hence
satisfies J 2 = λ1l for some λ ∈ R. Use (7.5.42) to conclude that λ = −1.
(iii) Fix an inner product on V and a symplectic form ω : V × V → R that
satisfies (7.5.42). Then the function fω in (7.5.38) is given by
X
fω (P ) =
ω(ei , ej )ω(P ei , P ej ),
P ∈ P0 (V ),
(7.5.44)
i,j

where e1 , . . . , e2n is an orthonormal basis of V . Prove that this is the norm
squared of ω with respect to the inner product ⟨·, P −1 ·⟩. Prove that P is a
critical point of fω if and only if the inner product ⟨·, P −1 ·⟩ is compatible
with ω. Prove that the space J (V, ω) of ω-compatible linear complex structures is a Hadamard manifold (Exercise
 6.5.24). Prove that, if J ∈ J (V, ω),
then the unitary group U(V, ω, J) := g ∈ Sp(V, ω) gJg −1 = J is a maximal compact subgroup of Sp(V, ω) and every compact subgroup of Sp(V, ω)
is conjugate to a subgroup of U(V, ω, J). All this is of course well known, but
this exercise shows how these results can be derived from Theorem 7.5.17.
Moreover, it is not necessary to assume that Sp(V, ω) is connected. One
can start with the identity component of Sp(V, ω), prove that it is contained
in SL(V ), and deduce the connectivity of Sp(V, ω) from that of U(V, ω, J).

Semisimple Lie Algebras*

This section discusses applications of the results in §7.5.3 to Lie algebra
theory, following the work of Donaldson [17]. It examines symmetric inner
products on Lie algebras (§7.6.1), establishes their existence on simple Lie
algebras (§7.6.2), and derives as consequences several standard results in Lie
algebra theory, such as the uniqueness of maximal compact subgroups up
to conjugation for semisimple Lie algebras (§7.6.3), and Cartan’s theorem
about the compact real form of a semisimple complex Lie algebra (§7.6.4).
Here are some basic definitions that will be used throughout this section.
Let g be a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra (Definition 2.4.22). A vector
subspace h ⊂ g is called an ideal iff [ξ, η] ∈ h for every ξ ∈ g and every η ∈ h.
The Lie algebra g is called abelian iff the Lie bracket vanishes. It is called
simple iff it is not abelian and does not contain any ideal other than h = {0}
and h = g. Examples of ideals in any Lie algebra g are the center Z(g)
(Exercise 2.5.34) and the commutant [g, g] (Exercise 5.2.24), defined by
Z(g) := {ξ ∈ g | [ξ, η] = 0 for all η ∈ g} ,
[g, g] := span {[ξ, η] | ξ, η ∈ g} .
Recall also the definition of the adjoint representation ad : g → Der(g) in
Example 2.5.23 by ad(ξ) := [ξ, ·] for ξ ∈ g and the definition of the Killing
form κ : g × g → R in Example 5.2.25 by κ(ξ, η) := trace(ad(ξ)ad(η))
for ξ, η ∈ g. Let Aut0 (g) be the connected component of the identity in the
group Aut(g) of automorphisms of g. This is a Lie subgroup of GL(g) whose
Lie algebra is the space Lie(Aut0 (g)) = Der(g) of derivations on g.

7.6.1

Symmetric Inner Products

In [17] Donaldson introduced the following notion.
Definition 7.6.1. Let g be a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra. An inner
product ⟨·, ·⟩ on g is called symmetric iff it satisfies the condition
δ ∈ Der(g)

=⇒

δ ∗ ∈ Der(g).

(7.6.1)

Here δ ∗ : g → g denotes the adjoint of the endomorphism δ with respect to
the inner product, i.e. it satisfies ⟨ξ, δ ∗ η⟩ = ⟨δξ, η⟩ for all ξ, η ∈ g.
Exercise 7.6.2. Let g be a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra equipped with
a symmetric inner product. Prove that g ∈ Aut0 (g) =⇒ g ∗ ∈ Aut0 (g).
Hint: See Exercise 7.5.16.
Some consequences of the existence of a symmetric inner product are
derived in Lemma 7.6.8 below. To begin with we discuss some examples.

392

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Every vector space endomorphism of a Lie algebra g that takes values
in the center Z(g) and vanishes on the commutant [g, g] is a derivation.
Conversely, every derivation that takes values in Z(g) necessarily vanishes
on [g, g]. The space of such derivations is an ideal in Der(g), denoted by

(7.6.2)
DerZ (g) := δ ∈ Der(g) im(δ) ⊂ Z(g) .
Example 7.6.3. Consider the abelian Lie algebra g = Rm . The adjoint
representation is trivial and Der(g) = gl(m, R) = Rm×m is the Lie algebra
of all vector space endomorphisms of g. Thus Der(g) = DerZ (g), the Killing
form on g vanishes, and every inner product on g is symmetric.
Example 7.6.4. Consider the Lie algebra g = gl(m, R) with [g, g] = sl(m, R)
and Z(g) = R1l. It satisfies g = [g, g] ⊕ Z(g) and Der(g) = ad(g) ⊕ DerZ (g),
where DerZ (g) ⊂ Der(g) is the one-dimensional subspace generated by the
derivation δZ (A) = trace(A)1l (whose trace is m). Moreover, the standard
inner product ⟨A, A′ ⟩ = trace(AT A′ ) on g is symmetric and the kernel of the
Killing form κ(A, A′ ) = 2mtrace(AA′ ) − 2trace(A)trace(A′ ) is Z(g).
Example 7.6.5. Consider the Lie algebra g = gl(m, R) × Rm with the
Lie bracket [(A, v), (A′ , v ′ )] := ([A, A′ ], Av ′ − A′ v). This Lie algebra can be
identified with the space of all affine vector fields on Rm . It has a trivial center and the commutant [g, g] = sl(m, R) × Rm has codimension one.
Moreover, trace(ad(A, v)) = trace(A) for every (A, v) ∈ g, the kernel of the
Killing form κ((A, v), (A′ , v ′ )) = (2m + 1)trace(AA′ ) − 2trace(A)trace(A′ ) is
the abelian ideal {0} × Rm , and the adjoint representation ad : g → Der(g)
is a Lie algebra isomorphism.
Example 7.6.6. Consider the Heisenberg algebra h = V ×R of a symplectic
vector space (V, ω) with the Lie bracket [(v, t), (v ′ , t′ )] = (0, ω(v, v ′ )) (see
Exercise 2.5.15). It satisfies Z(h) = [h, h] = {0} × R and the Killing form
vanishes. Every derivation on h has the form δ(v, t) = (Av + λv, Λ(v) + 2λt),
where λ ∈ R, Λ ∈ V ∗ , and A ∈ sp(V, ω). The subspace ad(h) = DerZ (h)
consists of all derivations of the form δ(v, t) = (0, Λ(v)).
Example 7.6.7. The Heisenberg algebra of a symplectic vector space (V, ω)
extends to a Lie algebra g = sp(V, ω) × V × R with the Lie bracket
[(A, v, t), (A′ , v ′ , t′ )] = ([A, A′ ], Av ′ − A′ v, ω(v, v ′ )).
It satisfies [g, g] = g and has a one-dimensional center Z(g) = {0} × {0} × R.
The kernel of the Killing form is the Heisenberg algebra and the adjoint
representation ad : g → Der(g) is surjective.
The next lemma shows that the Lie algebras in Examples 7.6.5, 7.6.6,
and 7.6.7 do not admit symmetric inner products.

7.6. SEMISIMPLE LIE ALGEBRAS*

393

Lemma 7.6.8. Let g be a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra equipped with
a symmetric inner product. Then
Der(g) = ad(g) ⊕ DerZ (g),

g = [g, g] ⊕ Z(g),

(7.6.3)

the kernel of the Killing form κ : g × g → R is the center of g, and there
exists an involution g → g : ξ 7→ ξ ∗ such that, for all ξ, η ∈ g,
ad(ξ ∗ ) = ad(ξ)∗ ,

[ξ, η]∗ = [η ∗ , ξ ∗ ].

(7.6.4)

Proof. Consider the orthogonal decomposition
Der(g) = A ⊕ B,

A := ad(g),

with respect to the inner product ⟨δ, δ ′ ⟩

B := A⊥ ,

(7.6.5)

trace(δ ∗ δ ′ ) for δ, δ ′ ∈ Der(g).

=
Since [δ, ad(ξ)] = ad(δξ) for δ ∈ Der(g) and ξ ∈ g, the subspace A is an ideal
in Der(g). Moreover, if δ ∈ B and ε ∈ Der(g), then ε∗ ∈ Der(g), hence
trace([ε, δ]∗ ad(ξ)) = trace(δ ∗ [ε∗ , ad(ξ)]) = trace(δ ∗ ad(ε∗ ξ)) = 0 for all ξ ∈ g,
and hence [ε, δ] ∈ B. Thus B is also an ideal in Der(g).
Next define DerZ (g)∗ := {δ ∗ | δ ∈ DerZ (g)}. We prove that
B = DerZ (g) = DerZ (g)∗ .

(7.6.6)

Since A and B are ideals we have [δ, δ ′ ] = 0 for all δ ∈ B and δ ′ ∈ A. Thus
ad(δξ) = [δ, ad(ξ)] = 0 for all δ ∈ B and ξ ∈ g, hence im(δ) ⊂ Z(g) for
all δ ∈ B, and so B ⊂ DerZ (g). Now let δ ∈ DerZ (g)∗ . Then δ ∗ ∈ DerZ (g),
hence [g, g] ⊂ ker(δ ∗ ), hence trace(δ ∗ ad(ξ)) = 0 for all ξ ∈ g, and so δ ∈ B.
Thus DerZ (g)∗ ⊂ B ⊂ DerZ (g) and so (7.6.6) holds for dimensional reasons.
The first equation in (7.6.3) follows directly from (7.6.5) and (7.6.6). It follows also from (7.6.6) that trace(δ ∗ ad(ξ)∗ ) = trace(ad(ξ)δ) = 0 for all ξ ∈ g
and all δ ∈ B, and so ad(ξ)∗ ∈ B ⊥ = A for all ξ ∈ g. Thus
δ∈A

=⇒

δ ∗ ∈ A.

(7.6.7)

By (7.6.7), an element ζ ∈ g belongs to Z(g) if and only if ad(ξ)∗ ζ = 0 for
all ξ ∈ g if and only if ⟨ζ, ad(ξ)η⟩ = 0 for all ξ, η ∈ g, if and only if ζ ∈ [g, g]⊥ .
Thus [g, g]⊥ = Z(g) and this proves the second equation in (7.6.3).
By (7.6.3), the map ad : g → Der(g) restricts to a Lie algebra isomorphism from [g, g] to A. Hence, by (7.6.7) there exists a unique involution
[g, g] → [g, g] : ξ 7→ ξ ∗ that satisfies (7.6.4) for all ξ, η ∈ [g, g]. By (7.6.3) this
involution extends uniquely to an involution g → g : ξ 7→ ξ ∗ such that ζ ∗ = ζ
for all ζ ∈ Z(g), and the extended involution satisfies (7.6.4) for all ξ, η ∈ g.
Now let ζ ∈ g belong to the kernel of the Killing form, i.e. κ(ζ, ξ) = 0
for all ξ ∈ g. Then |ad(ζ)|2 = κ(ζ, ζ ∗ ) = 0 and hence ζ ∈ Z(g). Conversely,
it follows directly from the definitions that Z(g) is contained in the kernel
of the Killing form and this proves Lemma 7.6.8.

7.6.2

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Simple Lie Algebras

The goal of this section is to establish the existence of symmetric inner
products on simple Lie algebras. First, the following lemma derives some
immediate consequences of the definition of a simple Lie algebra.
Lemma 7.6.9. Let g be a finite-dimensional simple real Lie algebra. Then
the center of g is trivial, the adjoint representation ad : g → Der(g) is
injective, the commutant is [g, g] = g, and trace(ad(ξ)) = 0 for all ξ ∈ g.
Proof. The center Z(g) is an ideal in g. It is not equal to g because g is not
abelian, and hence Z(g) = {0} because g is simple. The subspace [g, g] is
also an ideal in g. It is nonzero because g is not abelian, and hence [g, g] = g
because g is simple. The adjoint representation ad : g → Der(g) is injective because its kernel is the center of g. The last assertion follows
from

the fact that [g, g] = g and trace ad([ξ, η]) = trace [ad(ξ), ad(η)] = 0 for
all ξ, η ∈ g. This proves Lemma 7.6.9.
That the Killing form of a simple Lie algebra is nondegenerate is a deeper
result that does not follow directly from the definition. In [17, Theorem 1]
Donaldson deduces the existence of symmetric inner products on simple Lie
algebras from Theorem 7.5.17 and derives as corollaries various standard
results in Lie algebra theory, including nondegeneracy of the Killing form.
Theorem 7.6.10. Let g be a finite-dimensional simple real Lie algebra.
Then the Killing form on g is nondegenerate, the adjoint representation
ad : g → Der(g) is bijective, every derivation δ : g → g has trace zero, and
every automorphism in the identity component Aut0 (g) has determinant one.
In particular, Theorem 7.6.10 establishes for every simple Lie algebra g
the existence of a connected Lie group Aut0 (g) ⊂ SL(g) whose Lie algebra
is isomorphic to g.
Theorem 7.6.11 (Donaldson). Every finite-dimensional simple real Lie
algebra admits a symmetric inner product. Moreover, if SO(g) is the special
orthogonal group associated to a symmetric inner product on g, then
K := Aut0 (g) ∩ SO(g)

(7.6.8)

is connected and is a maximal compact subgroup of Aut0 (g), every compact
subgroup of Aut0 (g) is conjugate to a Lie subgroup of K, and every maximal
compact subgroup of Aut0 (g) is conjugate to K.

Given an inner product ⟨·, ·⟩ on any m-dimensional Lie algebra g and an
orthonormal basis e1 , . . . , em of g, define the function fg : P0 (g) → R by
X
fg (P ) :=
[ei , ej ], P −1 [P ei , P ej ]
(7.6.9)
i,j

for P ∈ P0 (g). The right hand side of (7.6.9) is independent of the choice
of the orthonormal basis and is the norm squared of the Lie bracket with
respect to the inner product ⟨·, P −1 ·⟩ on g.
Theorem 7.6.12 (Donaldson). Let g be a finite-dimensional simple real
Lie algebra equipped with a symmetric inner product. Then the set


Mg := P ∈ P0 (g) dfg (P ) = 0 = P ∈ P0 (g) fg (P ) = inf fg

= P0 (g) ∩ Aut(g) = exp(δ) δ ∈ Der(g), δ = δ ∗
(7.6.10)

−1
= P ∈ P0 (g) the inner product ⟨·, P ·⟩ is symmetric
of critical points of fg is a geodesically convex and totally geodesic submanifold of P0 (g). Hence it is a Hadamard manifold and a symmetric space.
The proofs require three preparatory lemmas. We do not assume that
every derivation has trace zero. Thus it is necessary as an intermediate step
to introduce the subspace Der0 (g) := {δ ∈ Der(g) | trace(δ) = 0}. We will
consider inner products on g that satisfy the condition
δ ∈ Der0 (g)

=⇒

δ ∗ ∈ Der0 (g).

(7.6.11)

Lemma 7.6.13. Let g be a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra satisfying
the conditions Z(g) = {0} and [g, g] = g, and fix an inner product ⟨·, ·⟩ on g.
Then the inner product is symmetric if and only if it satsfies (7.6.11). Moreover, if such an inner product exists, then Der(g) = ad(g) = Der0 (g).
Proof. Assume (7.6.11) and consider the decomposition Der0 (g) = A0 ⊕ B0 ,
where A0 := ad(g) ⊂ Der0 (g) (because [g, g] = g) and B0 := A⊥
0 are ideals
in Der0 (g) as in the proof of Lemma 7.6.8. Then ad(δξ) = [δ, ad(ξ)] = 0 for
all δ ∈ B0 and all ξ ∈ g. Since Z(g) = {0}, this implies B0 = 0, and hence the
adjoint representation ad : g → Der0 (g) is bijective. By (7.6.11), this implies
the existence of an involution ξ 7→ ξ ∗ such that ad(ξ ∗ ) = ad(ξ)∗ for all ξ ∈ g.
Since the adjoint representation ad : g → Der(g) is injective, this in turn implies that the Killing form is nondegenerate and so Der(g) = ad(g) = Der0 (g)
by Lemma 7.4.3. Thus the inner product on g is symmetric. Conversely,
if the inner product on g is symmetric, then it satisfies (7.6.11) because δ
and δ ∗ have the same trace. This proves Lemma 7.6.13.

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Lemma 7.6.14. Let g be a finite-dimensional simple real Lie algebra with
a symmetric inner product, and let g → g : ξ 7→ ξ ∗ be the unique involution
that satisfies (7.6.4). Then there exists a constant c > 0 such that
κ(ξ ∗ , η) = c⟨ξ, η⟩

for all ξ, η ∈ g.

Proof. By Lemma 7.6.9 the adjoint representation ad : g → Der(g) is injective. Hence the map g × g → R : (ξ, η) 7→ κ(ξ ∗ , η) = trace(ad(ξ)∗ ad(η)) is
an inner product on g. Thus there exists a self-adjoint positive definite vector space isomorphism A : g → g such that κ(ξ ∗, η) = ⟨Aξ, η⟩ for all ξ, η ∈ g.
Let c > 0 be an eigenvalue of A and define h := η ∈ g Aη = cη . We prove
that h is an ideal in g. Let ξ ∈ g and η ∈ h. Then, for all ζ ∈ g,
⟨A[ξ, η], ζ⟩ = κ([ξ, η]∗ , ζ) = κ([η ∗ , ξ ∗ ], ζ) = κ(η ∗ , [ξ ∗ , ζ]) = ⟨Aη, [ξ ∗ , ζ]⟩
= ⟨Aη, ad(ξ ∗ )ζ⟩ = ⟨ad(ξ)Aη, ζ⟩ = ⟨[ξ, Aη], ζ⟩ = c⟨[ξ, η], ζ⟩.
Hence A[ξ, η] = c[ξ, η] and so [ξ, η] ∈ h. This shows that h is a nonzero ideal
and hence h = g. Thus A = c1l and this proves Lemma 7.6.14.
Given any inner product on g, call an element P ∈ P0 (g) symmetric
iff the inner product ⟨·, P −1 ·⟩ on g is symmetric. Thus every symmetric
element P ∈ P0 (g) determines an involution τP : Der(g) → Der(g) given
by τP (δ) := P δ ∗ P −1 . Denote its determinant by εP := det(τP ) ∈ {−1, +1}.
Lemma 7.6.15. Let g be a finite-dimensional simple real Lie algebra, choose
any inner product on g, and let P, P0 ∈ P0 (g) be symmetric elements.
Then P P0−1 ∈ Aut(g).
Proof. The composition of the involutions
τP and τP0 is the Lie algebra au∗
tomorphism τP ◦τP0 (δ) = P P0 δ ∗ P0−1 P −1 = P P0−1 δP0 P −1 for δ ∈ Der(g).
By Lemma 7.6.8 and Lemma 7.6.9 the very existence of a symmetric inner
product on g implies that the adjoint representation ad : g → Der(g) is a
Lie algebra isomorphism. Hence there exists a g ∈ Aut(g) such that
ad(gξ) = P P0−1 ad(ξ)P0 P −1

for all ξ ∈ g.

(7.6.13)

Since ad(gξ) = gad(ξ)g −1 , this automorphism satisfies the equations
g −1 P P0−1 [ξ, η] = [ξ, g −1 P P0−1 η]

for all ξ, η ∈ g,

det(g) = εP εP0 ∈ {−1, +1}.

Since P0 is symmetric, it follows from Lemma 7.6.8 and Lemma 7.6.14 that
there exists an involution g → g : ξ 7→ ξ ∗ and a constant c > 0 such that
ad(ξ ∗ ) = P0 ad(ξ)∗ P0−1 ,

κ(ξ ∗ , η) = c⟨ξ, P0−1 η⟩

(7.6.16)

for all ξ, η ∈ g. By (7.6.13) and (7.6.16) we have

κ((gξ)∗ , η) = trace P0 ad(gξ)∗ P0−1 ad(η)
∗

= trace P P0−1 ad(ξ)P0 P −1 P0−1 ad(η)P0

= trace P −1 P0 ad(ξ)∗ P0−1 P P0−1 ad(η)P0

= trace ad(ξ ∗ )P P0−1 ad(η)P0 P −1

= trace ad(ξ ∗ )ad(gη)
= κ(ξ ∗ , gη).
This shows that g is self-adjoint and positive definite with respect to the
inner product ⟨·, P0−1 ·⟩, and so det(g) = 1 by (7.6.15). Since P P0−1 is selfadjoint and positive definite with respect to the same inner product, the
vector space isomorphism g −1 P P0−1 = g −1/2 (g −1/2 P P0−1 g −1/2 )g 1/2 has only
positive real eigenvalues. Let λ > 0 be one such eigenvalue. Then the
eigenspace ker(λ1l − g −1 P P0−1 ) is a nonzero ideal in g by (7.6.14), and so
is equal to g, because g is simple. Thus g −1 P P0−1 = λ1l, and since g, P, P0
all have determinant one, it follows that λ = 1 and so P P0−1 = g ∈ Aut(g).
This proves Lemma 7.6.15.
Proof of Theorems 7.6.10, 7.6.11, and 7.6.12. We use the results of §7.5.3
in the situation where V := g is the Lie algebra itself and W := Λ2 g∗ ⊗ g is
the space of all skew-symmetric bilinear maps τ : g × g → g. The Lie group
homomorphism ρ : SL(g) → SL(W ) is given by the standard action of the
group SL(g) on W , i.e.
(ρ(g)τ )(ξ, η) := gτ (g −1 ξ, g −1 η)
for g ∈ SL(g), τ ∈ W , and ξ, η ∈ g. Fix an inner product ⟨·, ·⟩ on g and an
orthonormal basis e1 , . . . , em of g, and define
X
⟨σ, τ ⟩W :=
⟨σ(ei , ej ), τ (ei , ej )⟩
(7.6.17)
i,j

for σ, τ ∈ W . This inner product satisfies the requirements of Lemma 7.5.19,
i.e. ρ(A∗ ) = ρ(A)∗ for all A ∈ sl(g). The vector w := [·, ·] ∈ W is chosen
to be the Lie bracket. This vector is nonzero because g is not abelian. The
isotropy subgroup of w is the group Aut(g) ∩ SL(g) of all automorphisms of
determinant one. Denote its identity component by G ⊂ Aut0 (g) ∩ SL(g).
This is a Lie subgroup of SL(g) with the Lie algebra Lie(G) = Der0 (g).

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Claim 1. G acts irreducibly on g.
Let h ⊂ g be a subspace that is invariant under the action of G. Then δh ⊂ h
for every δ ∈ Der0 (g). By Lemma 7.6.9 this implies ad(ξ)h ⊂ h for all ξ ∈ g,
so h is an ideal. Thus h = {0} or h = g because g is simple.
Claim 2. fg is convex and G-invariant and has a critical point. Moreover,
every critical point P ∈ P0 (g) is symmetric, and Der0 (g) = Der(g).
In the present setting the function fw in Lemma 7.5.20 agrees with the
function fg in (7.6.9) and Gw = G. Hence fg is convex and G-invariant by
Lemma 7.5.22, and G acts irreducibly on g by Claim 1. Thus Lemma 7.5.23
asserts that fg has a critical point. Let P ∈ P0 (g) be a critical point of fg .
Then by Lemma 7.5.23 the inner product ⟨·, P −1 ·⟩ satisfies (7.6.11) and so,
by Lemma 7.6.13, this inner product is symmetric and Der(g) = Der0 (g).
Claim 3. Fix a critical point P0 ∈ P0 (g) of fg and any element P ∈ P0 (g).
Then the following are equivalent.
(a) P is a critical point of fg .
(b) fg (P ) = inf fg .
(c) P P0−1 ∈ Aut(g).
(d) There exists a δ ∈ Der(g) such that δ = P0 δ ∗ P0−1 , exp(δ) = P P0−1 .
(e) The inner product ⟨·, P −1 ·⟩ on g is symmeric.
Since fg is convex by Claim 2, the equivalence of (a) and (b) follows from
Lemma 7.5.9. Since Der(g) = Der0 (g) by Claim 2, the equivalence of (b),
(c), and (d) follows from part (ii) of Lemma 7.5.22. Moreover, (a) implies (e)
by Claim 2, and (e) implies (c) by Lemma 7.6.15. This proves Claim 3.
The existence of a symmetric inner product on g was proved in Claim 2.
Thus the nondegeneracy of the Killing form follows from Lemma 7.6.8.
The remaining assertions of Theorem 7.6.10 are direct consequences of the
nondegeneracy of the Killing form. In particular, the adjoint representation ad : g → Der(g) is bijective and Der(g) ⊂ sl(g) by Lemma 7.4.3.
Hence Aut0 (g) ⊂ SL(g) and so Gw = G = Aut0 (g) in the notation of §7.5.3.
Now fix a symmetric inner product on g. Then P0 = 1l is a critical point
of fg by “(e) =⇒ (a)” in Claim 3. Hence the assertions about the subgroup K = Aut0 (g) ∩ SO(g) in Theorem 7.6.11 follow from Lemma 7.5.23.
The equalities in (7.6.10) follow from the equivalence of (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)
in Claim 3 with P0 = 1l, and the remaining assertions about the space Mg
in Theorem 7.6.12 follow from Lemma 7.5.24. This completes the proof of
Theorems 7.6.10, 7.6.11, and 7.6.12.

Semisimple Lie Algebras

The following theorem characterizes semisimple Lie algebras in terms of
symmetric inner products. First observe that, if h is an ideal in a finitedimensional real Lie algebra g, then the subspace

h′ := η ′ ∈ g | κ(η, η ′ ) = 0 for all η ∈ h
(7.6.18)
is also an ideal, because every η ′ ∈ h′ satisfies κ(η, [ξ, η ′ ]) = κ([η, ξ], η ′ ) = 0
for all ξ ∈ g and all η ∈ h, and so [ξ, η ′ ] ∈ h′ for all ξ ∈ g.
Theorem 7.6.16 (Semisimple Lie algebras). Let g be a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) g has a trivial center and admits a symmetric inner product.
(ii) The Killing form κ : g × g → R is nondegenerate.
(iii) If h ⊂ g is an ideal, then g = h ⊕ h′ .
(iv) g is a direct sum of simple ideals.
(v) There exists an inner product ⟨·, ·⟩ on g, an involution g → g : ξ 7→ ξ ∗ ,
and a constant c > 0 such that, for all ξ, η ∈ g,
ad(ξ ∗ ) = ad(ξ)∗ ,

[ξ, η]∗ = [η ∗ , ξ ∗ ],

κ(ξ ∗ , η) = c⟨ξ, η⟩.

(7.6.19)

Definition 7.6.17. A real Lie algebra g is called semisimple iff it is finitedimensional and satisfies the equivalent conditions in Theorem 7.6.16.
Proof of Theorem 7.6.16. That (i) implies (ii) was shown in Lemma 7.6.8.
We prove that (ii) is equivalent to (iii). Assume first that the Killing
form is nondegenerate and let h ⊂ g be an ideal. Then
η ∈ h,

η ′ ∈ h′

=⇒

[η, η ′ ] = 0,

(7.6.20)

because κ([η, η ′ ], ξ) = κ(η, [η ′ , ξ]) = 0 for all ξ ∈ g, all η ∈ h, and all η ′ ∈ h′ .
Now let η ∈ h ∩ h′ . Then η ′ := ad(ξ)ad(η)ζ = [ξ, [η, ζ]] ∈ h′ for all ξ, ζ ∈ g.
Hence, by (7.6.20) we have (ad(ξ)ad(η))2 ζ = [ξ, [η, η ′ ]] = 0 for all ξ, ζ ∈ g.
Thus (ad(ξ)ad(η))2 = 0 and so κ(ξ, η) = trace(ad(ξ)ad(η)) = 0 for all ξ ∈ g.
This implies η = 0 by nondegeneracy of the Killing form. Thus h ∩ h′ = {0}
and so g = h ⊕ h′ because dim(h) + dim(h′ ) = dim(g). This shows that (ii)
implies (iii). To prove the converse, take h = g so that h′ = {0} is the kernel
of the Killing form.
It follows from (ii) and (iii) that, for every ideal h ⊂ g, the Killing forms
of h and h′ are both nondegenerate. Hence an induction argument shows
that (iii) implies (iv).

400

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

We prove that (iv) implies (v). Assume that g = g1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ gr is a direct sum of simple ideals gj ⊂ g. Fix an index j ∈ {1, . . . , r} and denote
by κj : gj × gj → R the Killing form of gj . By Theorem 7.6.11 the Lie algebra gj admits a symmetric inner product ⟨·, ·⟩j . Hence, by Lemma 7.6.8
there exists an involution gj → gj : ξ 7→ ξ ∗ that satisfies (7.6.4), and by
∗
Lemma 7.6.14 there exists a constant cj > 0 such
Pthat κj (ξ , η) = cj ⟨ξ, η⟩j
for all ξ, η ∈ gj . Thus the inner product ⟨ξ, η⟩ := j cj ⟨ξj , ηj ⟩j for ξj , ηj ∈ gj
and ξ = ξ1 + · · · + ξr , η = η1 + · · · + ηr satisfies the requirements of part (v)
with c = 1 and ξ ∗ := ξ1∗ + · · · + ξr∗ .
If (v) holds, then the Killing form is nondegenerate, hence Z(g) = 0
and Der(g) = ad(g) by Lemma 7.4.3, and hence the inner product in (v) is
symmetric. Thus (v) implies (i) and this proves Theorem 7.6.16.
Corollary 7.6.18 (Cartan Involution). Let g be a nonzero semisimple
real Lie algebra equipped with a symmetric inner product and let ξ 7→ ξ ∗ be
the involution in Lemma 7.6.8. Then the map
g → g : ξ 7→ −ξ ∗

(7.6.21)

is a Lie algebra homomorphism (called a Cartan involution). The Cartan
involution (7.6.21) gives rise to a splitting
g = k ⊕ p,

k := {ξ ∈ g | ξ + ξ ∗ = 0} ,

p := {η ∈ g | η = η ∗ } ,

(7.6.22)

such that
[k, k] ⊂ k,

[k, p] ⊂ p,

[p, p] ⊂ k.

(7.6.23)

Moreover, k is nontrivial, the Killing form κ : g × g → R is negative definite
on k and positive definite on p, and κ(ξ, η) = 0 for all ξ ∈ k and all η ∈ p.
Proof. That the map (7.6.21) is a Lie algebra homomorphism follows directly from (7.6.4). It follows also from (7.6.4) that the subspaces k, p ⊂ g
in (7.6.22) satisfy (7.6.23). That g is the direct sum of these subspaces,
follows from the identity ζ ∗∗ = ζ for ζ ∈ g, which implies


ζ = ξ + η,
ξ := 21 ζ − ζ ∗ ∈ k,
η := 12 ζ + ζ ∗ ∈ p.
By (7.6.23) the summand k must be nontrivial, because g is nonzero and
hence is not abelian.
∗
Next observe that the formula ⟨A, B⟩
p:= trace(A B) defines an inner
∗
product on End(g) with the norm |A| := trace(A A), and that

κ(ξ, η ∗ ) = κ(ξ ∗ , η) = trace ad(ξ)∗ ad(η) = ⟨ad(ξ), ad(η)⟩ .
For ξ ∈ k and η ∈ p this implies κ(ξ, ξ) = −|ad(ξ)|2 , κ(η, η) = |ad(η)|2 ,
and κ(ξ, η) = 0. This proves Corollary 7.6.18.

7.6. SEMISIMPLE LIE ALGEBRAS*

401

Lemma 7.6.19. Let g be a semisimple real Lie algebra equipped with a
symmetric inner product, let ξ 7→ ξ ∗ be the involution in Lemma 7.6.8,
let g = g1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ gr be a decomposition into simple ideals gj , and let k, p ⊂ g
be as in Corollary 7.6.18. Then the following holds.
(i) The simple ideals gj ⊂ g are pairwise orthogonal.
(ii) Each ideal gj is invariant under the involution ξ 7→ ξ ∗ .
(iii) p is the orthogonal complement of k.
(iv) For each j the restriction of the inner product to gj is symmetric
and gj = kj ⊕ pj , where kj = k ∩ gj , pj = p ∩ gj are as in Corollary 7.6.18.
Proof. We prove part (i). For each i the orthogonal complement g⊥
i is an
ideal, because ⟨[ξ, η], ζ⟩ = ⟨η, [ξ ∗ , ζ]⟩ = 0 for all ξ ∈ g, η ∈ g⊥
,
ζ
∈
g
i , and
iT
⊥
⊥
⊥
so [ξ, η] ∈ gi for all ξ ∈ g, η ∈ gi . This implies that hj := i̸=j gi is an
ideal, and so is the subspace hj ∩ gj . So either hj ∩ gj = {0} or hj = gj ,
because gj is simple. If hj ∩ gj = {0}, then [ξ, η] = 0 for all ξ ∈ gj and
all η ∈ hj , hence gj ⊂ Z(g), and this is impossible because the center of g is
trivial. Thus hj = gj for all j and this proves (i).
We prove part (ii). The subspace g∗j := {η ∗ | η ∈ gj } is an ideal, because [ξ, η ∗ ] = [η, ξ ∗ ]∗ ∈ g∗j for all ξ ∈ g and all η ∈ gj . By part (i) we
have ⟨[ξ, η ∗ ], ζ⟩ = −⟨ξ, [η, ζ]⟩ = 0 for all ξ ∈ gi and η ∈ gj with i ̸= j, and
all ζ ∈ g. Hence [gi , g∗j ] = 0 for i ̸= j. Hence the ideal g∗j ∩ gj cannot be
zero, because otherwise [gj , g∗j ] = 0 and so g∗j ⊂ Z(g). Hence g∗j = gj ,
because gj is simple. This proves (ii).
We prove part (iii). By (ii) and Lemma 7.6.14 the involution ξ 7→ ξ ∗
preserves the inner product on gj , and so by (i) it preserves the inner product
on all of g. Hence ⟨ξ, η⟩ = ⟨ξ ∗ , η ∗ ⟩ = −⟨ξ, η⟩ for all ξ ∈ k and all η ∈ p. Thus k
and p are orthogonal to each other and this proves (iii).
Part (iv) follows directly from (ii) and this proves Lemma 7.6.19.
Theorem 7.6.20. Let g be an m-dimensional real Lie algebra that is not
abelian and fix an inner product on g and an orthonormal basis e1 , . . . , em
of g. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) P = 1l is a critical point of fg .

(iii) g is semisimple, the inner product is symmetric, and there exists an

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

This holds if and only if there exists a constant c ∈ R that satisfies (7.6.24).
Thus we have proved that (i) is equivalent to (ii).
We prove that (i) and (ii) imply (iii). Since P = 1l is a critical point of fg ,
Lemma 7.5.20 asserts that the inner product on g is symmetric. Thus by
Lemma 7.6.8 there exists an involution g → g : ξ 7→ ξ ∗ that satisfies (7.6.4).
Hence by (ii) there exists a real number c such that

2ad(e∗i )ad(ei ) − ad(ei )ad(e∗i ) = c1l.

Qg :=

Since g is not abelian, the endomorphism Qg has a positive trace, so c > 0.
This implies that the center of g is trivial, because Z(g) ⊂ ker(Qg ). Hence,
by Lemma 7.6.8, the Killing form on g is nondegenerate. By Lemma 7.6.19
this implies that the decomposition g = k ⊕ p in Corollary 7.6.18 is orthogonal. Hence the orthonormal basis e1 , . . . , em of g can be chosen such
that e1 , . . . , ek is a basis of k and ek+1 , . . . , em is a basis of p. Thus e∗i = −ei
for i ≤ k and e∗i = ei for i > k, and so it follows from (7.6.25) that

That (iii) implies (ii) follows by reversing this argument. By (iii) the
Killing form is nondegenerate and the inner product is symmetric and is
preserved by the involution ξ 7→ ξ ∗ . Thus the splitting g = k ⊕ p is orthogonal, and hence the orthonormal basis e1 , . . . , em of g can be chosen such
that e1 , . . . , ek is a basis of k and ek+1 , . . . , em is a basis of p. Moreover,

Corollary 7.6.21 (Cartan Decomposition). Let g be a semisimple real
Lie algebra equipped with a symmetric inner product, let g → g : ξ 7→ ξ ∗ be
the involution in Lemma 7.6.8, and define
K := Aut0 (g) ∩ SO(g),

Der+ (g) := {δ ∈ Der(g) | δ = δ ∗ } .

Then the following holds.
(i) K is connected and is a maximal compact subgroup of Aut0 (g), every
compact subgroup of Aut0 (g) is conjugate in Aut0 (g) to a Lie subgroup of K,
and every maximal compact subgroup of Aut0 (g) is conjugate to K.
(ii) The map
K × Der+ (g) → Aut0 (g) : (u, δ) 7→ exp(δ)u
is a diffeomorphism.
(iii) If there exists a c > 0 such that κ(ξ ∗ , η) = c⟨ξ, η⟩ for all ξ, η ∈ g, then
Mg := Crit(fg ) = P0 (g) ∩ Aut(g) = {exp(δ) | δ ∈ Der+ (g)}
is a totally geodesic and geodesically convex submanifold of P0 (g) and so is
a Hadamard manifold and a symmetric space, and the map
p
Aut0 (g) → P0 (g) : g 7→ gg ∗
descends to a diffeomorphism from the quotient space Aut0 (g)/K to Mg .
Proof. By Theorem 7.6.16 there exists a splitting g = g1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ gr into
simple ideals, this splitting is preserved by every derivation of g, and by
Lemma 7.6.19 it is also preserved by the involution ξ 7→ ξ ∗ . Thus Aut0 (g) is
isomorphic to the product of the groups Aut0 (gj ), and K = Aut0 (g) ∩ SO(g)
is isomorphic to the product of the subgroups Kj := Aut0 (gj ) ∩ SO(gj ).
Hence part (i) follows from Theorem 7.6.11. Moreover, by Lemma 7.6.19,
we have p = p1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ pr , and so part (ii) follows from Corollary 7.5.27.
Under the assumptions of (iii) Theorem 7.6.20 asserts that P0 = 1l is a
critical point of fg , so (iii) follows from Lemma 7.5.22, Lemma 7.5.24, and
Corollary 7.5.27. This proves Corollary 7.6.21.
Remark 7.6.22. The Lie algebra of the group K = Aut0 (g) ∩ SO(g) in
Corollary 7.6.21 is given by Lie(K) = {ad(ξ) | ξ ∈ k} (see Corollary 7.6.18).
If the summand p in (7.6.22) is trivial, then Aut0 (g) = K is a compact Lie
group. If p is nontrivial, then the quotient space Aut0 (g)/K is a nontrivial
Hadamard manifold diffeomorphic to p.

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Remark 7.6.23. One can replace the space P0 (g) of positive definite selfadjoint vector space isomorphisms P : g → g of determinant one by the
space Hg of inner products on g with a fixed determinant (Remark 6.5.11).
This eliminates the dependence on the background inner product and there
is then only one function fg : Hg → R whose set of minima is the totally
geodesic submanifold Mg ⊂ Hg of all symmetric inner products on g with a
fixed determinant that satisfy part (iii) of Theorem 7.6.20. The main result
asserts that, when g is not abelian, the space Mg is nonempty if and only
if g is semisimple (Theorem 7.6.16 and Theorem 7.6.20).

7.6.4

Complex Lie Algebras

A complex Lie algebra is a complex vector space g equipped with a Lie
bracket g × g → g : (ξ, η) 7→ [ξ, η] that is complex bilinear, i.e. it is a skewsymmetric bilinear map that satisfies the Jacobi identity and
[iξ, η] = [ξ, iη] = i[ξ, η]
for all ξ, η ∈ g. Thus every complex Lie algebra is also a real Lie algebra.
Let g be a finite-dimensional complex Lie algebra. A complex ideal in g
is a complex linear subspace h ⊂ g that satisfies [ξ, η] ∈ h for all ξ ∈ g and
all η ∈ h. The complex Lie algebra g is called simple iff it is not abelian and
has no complex ideals other than h = {0} and h = g. It is called semisimple
iff it is finite-dimensional and the complex Killing form κc : g × g → C,
defined by κc (ξ, η) := tracec (ad(ξ)ad(η)) for ξ, η ∈ g, is nondegenerate.
Since κ = 2Reκc , a complex Lie algebra is semisimple if and only if it is
semisimple as a real Lie algebra. The next lemma shows that the analogous
assertion holds for simple complex Lie algebras (see [17, Lemma 7]).
Lemma 7.6.24. A finite-dimensional complex Lie algebra g is simple if and
only if it is simple as a real Lie algebra.
Proof. Let g be a simple complex Lie algebra of complex dimension n and
let h ⊂ g be a real linear subspace of g that satisfies [ξ, η] ∈ h for all ξ ∈ g
and all η ∈ h. Then the subspaces
h ∩ ih,

h + ih

are complex ideals in g, and their real dimensions satisfy the equation
dimR (h ∩ ih) + dimR (h + ih) = 2 dimR (h).
Since both summands on the left are either 0 or 2n, the real dimension of h
is either 0, n, or 2n. We claim that the dimension cannot be n.

7.6. SEMISIMPLE LIE ALGEBRAS*

Assume, by contradiction, that dimR (h) = n. Then
h ∩ ih = {0},

h + ih = g.

Hence, for all ζ, ζ ′ ∈ g there exist ξ, η ∈ h such that ζ = ξ + iη, and so

[ζ, ζ ′ ] = [ξ, ζ ′ ] + [η, iζ ′ ] = i [ξ, −iζ ′ ] + [η, ζ ′ ] ∈ h ∩ ih = {0}.
This contradicts the fact that g is not abelian. Thus h = {0} or h = g, and
this proves Lemma 7.6.24.
Lemma 7.6.25. Let g be a semisimple complex Lie algebra. Then g is a
direct sum of simple complex ideals.
Proof. Let h ⊂ g be a real ideal and let h′ ⊂ g be as in (7.6.18). Then
it follows from “(ii) =⇒ (iii)” in Theorem 7.6.16 that [h + ih, h′ ] = {0}.
Hence h + ih ⊂ h′′ = h and so ih = h. Thus every real ideal in g is a complex
ideal. Hence the assertion follows from “(ii) =⇒ (iv)” in Theorem 7.6.16.
The next result is a theorem of Cartan [13] which asserts that every
semisimple complex Lie algebra has a compact real form. The proof given
here is due to Donaldson [17, Lemma 8].
Theorem 7.6.26 (Cartan). Let g be a nonzero semisimple complex Lie
algebra equipped with a symmetric inner product. Then
p = ik,

g = k ⊕ ik,

(7.6.27)

where k, p are as in Corollary 7.6.18. Moreover, the group Aut0 (g) is the
complexification of the maximal compact subgroup K = Aut0 (g) ∩ SO(g), i.e.
Aut0 (g) = {exp(iδ)u | u ∈ K, δ ∈ Lie(K)}

(7.6.28)

and the map K × Lie(K) → Aut0 (g) : (u, δ) 7→ exp(iδ)u is a diffeomorphism.
Proof. Assume first that g is simple. Then g is simple as a real Lie algebra
(Lemma 7.6.24), and so has a nondegenerate Killing form (Theorem 7.6.10).
By the inclusions in (7.6.23) the subspace
h := (k ∩ ip) + (p ∩ ik) = (k ∩ ip) + i(k ∩ ip)
is a complex ideal in g. Hence it is either {0} or g. If h = g, then it follows
from (7.6.22) that p = ik. Assume, by contradiction, that h = {0}. Then
k ∩ ip = {0},

g = k ⊕ ip.

CHAPTER 7. TOPICS IN GEOMETRY

Hence the map σ : g → g, defined by
σ(ξ + iη) := ξ − iη
for ξ ∈ k and η ∈ p is a Lie algebra homomorphism and an involution. This
implies ad(σ(ζ)) = σad(ζ)σ and so κ(σ(ζ), σ(ζ ′ )) = κ(ζ, ζ ′ ) for all ζ, ζ ′ ∈ g.
Hence κ(ξ, iη) = 0 for all ξ ∈ k and all η ∈ p. Thus ip is the orthogonal
complement of k with respect to the Killing form. Thus, by Corollary 7.6.18,
p = ip.
However, for all η ∈ p we have κ(iη, iη) = −κ(η, η) = −|ad(η)|2 . Hence
the Killing form is negative definite on ip and positive definite on p, and
hence p = {0}. This implies k = ik. Since the Killing form is positive definite
on ik and negative definite on k, this is a contradiction. This contradiction
shows that our assumption h = {0} must have been wrong. Thus h = g and
hence p = ik. This completes the proof of (7.6.27) in the simple case.
For general semisimple complex Lie algebras, the proof of the equations
in (7.6.27) reduces to the simple case by Lemma 7.6.19 and Lemma 7.6.25.
Equation (7.6.28) follows directly from (7.6.27) and Corollary 7.6.21. This
proves Theorem 7.6.26.
Remark 7.6.27. Let g be a semisimple complex Lie algebra. Then Aut(g)
is a complex Lie group, i.e. it admits the structure of a complex manifold
such that the structure maps
G × G → G : (h, g) 7→ hg,

G → G : g 7→ g −1

are holomorphic. The proof uses the fact that Der(g) is isomorphic to g and
that the resulting almost complex structure on Aut(g) is integrable (as it is
d
preserved by the torsion-free connection g−1 ∇b
g = dt
(g −1 gb) + [g −1 ġ, g −1 gb]).
Theorem 7.6.26 asserts that the identity component G = Aut0 (g) of the
group of automorphisms of g is the complexification of the maximal compact subgroup K = Aut0 (g) ∩ SO(g), i.e. its Lie algebra Der(g) = ad(g)
is the complexification of the Lie algebra Lie(K) = ad(k) and the quotient space G/K is contractible. These conditions imply the universality
property that every Lie group homomorphism ρ : K → G with values in a
complex Lie group G extends to a unique holomorphic Lie group homomorphism ρc : G → G such that ρc |K = ρ. Such a complexification exists
for every compact Lie group K, whether or not it is semisimple. (For an
exposition see [20, Appendix B].)

The following exercise is inspired by a remark in [17, §5.1] concerning a
positive curvature manifold that is dual to Mg .
Exercise 7.6.28. Let g be a semisimple real Lie algebra equipped with
a symmetric inner product that satisfies condition (iii) in Theorem 7.6.20.
Consider the complexified Lie algebra

for ζ = ξ + iη ∈ gc and ζ ′ = ξ ′ + iη ′ ∈ gc . With this convention the Hermitian form (7.6.30) is complex anti-linear in the first variable and complex
linear in the second variable. Prove the following.
(a) gc is semisimple. Hint: gc has a trivial center and the real part
of (7.6.30) is a symmetric inner product on gc .
(b) If g is simple, then gc is simple. Hint: If hc is a complex ideal in gc ,

(c) Every real linear derivation on gc is complex linear and has complex
trace zero.
(d) The identity component Aut0 (gc ) of the group of real linear Lie algebra
automorphisms of gc consists of complex linear automorphisms of complex
determinant one. (Complex conjugation is a Lie algebra automorphism of gc
not in the identity component.)
(e) The subgroup

(f ) Let Φ + iΨ : g → gc be a Lie algebra homomorphism, i.e. for all ξ, η ∈ g,
Φ[ξ, η] = [Φξ, Φη] − [Ψξ, Ψη],

Ψ[ξ, η] = [Φξ, Ψη] + [Ψξ, Φη].

Assume Φ + iΨ is injective and denote its image by
l := {Φξ + iΨξ | ξ ∈ g} .
Then the following are equivalent.
(I) The real part of (7.6.30) restricts to a symmetric inner product on l.
(II) Φ∗ Φ + Ψ∗ Ψ ∈ Aut(g).
(III) l is a Lagrangian subspace of gc with respect to the imaginary part
of (7.6.30), i.e. Φ∗ Ψ − Ψ∗ Φ = 0.
Hint: If Φ∗ Φ + Ψ∗ Ψ ∈ Aut(g), then there exists a derivation α ∈ Der(g)
such that α = α∗ and exp(2α) = Φ∗ Φ + Ψ∗ Ψ (Corollary 7.6.21). Prove that

(g) The space of oriented Lagrangian Lie subalgebras l ⊂ gc isomorphic to g
(that can be joined to g by a path of such subspaces) is diffeomorphic to the
quotient space
Lg := Kc /K,
where Kc := Aut0 (gc ) ∩ SU(gc ) and K := Aut0 (g) ∩ SO(g). Hint: Choose
the embedding Φ + iΨ in (f) such that
Φ∗ Φ + Ψ∗ Ψ = 1l,

Φ∗ Ψ − Ψ∗ Φ = 0,

and extend it to a unitary automorphism of gc .
(h) The space Lg in part (g) embeds as a totally geodesic submanifold
of dimension dim(Lg ) = dim(p) into the symmetric space U(gc )/SO(g) of
all oriented Lagrangian subspaces of gc . Hence Lg has nonnegative sectional
curvature. (Hint: Example 5.2.18.) One can think of the positive curvature
manifold Lg of all Lagrangian Lie subalgebras of gc that are isomorphic
to g as dual to the negative curvature manifold Mg of all symmetric inner
products on g that satisfy condition (iii) in Theorem 7.6.20.

Remark 7.6.29. The idea of minimizing the norm of the Lie bracket was
the approach to the existence of a compact real form of a simple complex
Lie algebra suggested by Cartan [14] and carried out by Richardson [58].
One significant difference in the method of Donaldson [17], which we follow
in the section, is that there is no need to assume that the Killing form is
nondegenerate, but that this result emerges as a byproduct of the proof
(Theorem 7.6.10). There is also no need to use the structure theory of Lie
algebras as in the work of Weyl [77]. Instead one can use the existence of a
symmetric inner product as a starting point to develop the structure theory
of Lie algebras.
Remark 7.6.30. As pointed out by Donaldson [17], a more direct approach
to Theorem 7.6.26 would be to carry over the entire program in the present
section and §7.5 to the complex setting, starting in §7.5.2 with convex functions on the Hadamard manifold M = Q0 (V ) ∼
= SL(V )/SU(V ) of positive
definite Hermitian automorphisms with determinant one of a complex vector
space V equipped with a Hermitian inner product (Remark 6.5.20).
In the complex Lie algebra setting with Q0 (g) ∼
= SL(g, C)/SU(g, C) the
logarithm of the function fg : Q0 (g) → R is the log-norm function of Kempf
and Ness in geometric invariant theory [38, 20]. Thus the existence of a
critical point of fg is the polystability condition in GIT. This approach
was developed by Lauret [44] and he proved that the polystable points are
precisely the semisimple Lie algebras. This is the content of Theorem 7.6.20
in the complex setting. Lauret’s proof uses Cartan’s theorem about the
compact real form of a semisimple complex Lie algebra.
One can also deduce the theorems in the real setting from those in the
complex setting by complexifying the relevant real inner product space V
to obtain a complex vector space V c = V ⊕ iV with a Hermitian inner
product, and embedding the space P0 (V ) ∼
= SL(V )/SO(V ) as a totally
geodesic submanifold into Q0 (V c ) ∼
= SL(V c )/SU(V c ).

Appendix A

Notes
This appendix explains some notations and standard results from first year
analysis that are used throughout this book.

A.1

Maps and Functions

The notation f : X → Y means that f is a function which assigns to every
point x in the set X a point f (x) in the set Y . When Y = R we express this
by saying that f is a real valued function defined on the set X and, if Y is
a vector space, we may say that f is a vector valued function. However in
general it is better to say that f is a map from X to Y and call the set X
the source of the map and the set Y its target. The graph of f is the set
graph(f ) := {(x, y) ∈ X × Y | y = f (x)}.
We always distinguish two maps with the same graph when their targets are
different.
A map f : X → Y is said to be




 injective 
 f (x1 ) = f (x2 ) =⇒ x1 = x2

surjective
∀y ∈ Y ∃x ∈ X s.t. y = f (x)
iff




bijective
it is both injective and surjective.
Then
(a) f is injective

⇐⇒ it has a left inverse g : Y → X (i.e. g ◦ f = idX );

(b) f is surjective ⇐⇒ it has a right inverse g : Y → X (i.e. f ◦ g = idY );
(c) f is bijective

⇐⇒ it has a two sided inverse f −1 : Y → X.

(Item (b) is the Axiom of Choice.)

412

APPENDIX A. NOTES

The analogous principle holds for linear maps: if A ∈ Rm×n , then the
linear map Rn → Rm : x 7→ Ax is
(a) injective

⇐⇒ BA = 1ln for some B ∈ Rn×m ;

(b) surjective ⇐⇒ AB = 1lm for some B ∈ Rn×m ;
(c) bijective

⇐⇒

A is invertible (i.e. m = n and det(A) ̸= 0).

(Here 1lk is the k × k identity matrix.) However, this principle fails completely for continuous maps: the map f : [0, 2π) → S 1 defined by f (θ) =
(cos θ, sin θ) is continuous and bijective but its inverse is not continuous.
(Here S 1 ⊂ R2 is the unit circle x2 + y 2 = 1.)

A.2

Normal Forms

The Fundamental Idea of Differential Calculus is that near a point x0 ∈ U
a smooth map f : U → V behaves like its linear approximation, i.e.
f (x) ≈ f (x0 ) + df (x0 )(x − x0 ).
The Normal Form Theorem from Linear Algebra says that if A ∈ Rm×n has
rank r, then there are invertible matrices P ∈ Rm×m and Q ∈ Rn×n such
that


1lr
0r×(n−r)
−1
P AQ =
.
0(m−r)×r 0(m−r)×(n−r)
By the Fundamental Idea we can expect an analogous theorem for smooth
maps.
Theorem A.2.1 (Local Normal Form for Smooth Maps). Let U ⊂ Rn
and V ⊂ Rm be open, x0 ∈ U , and f : U → V be smooth. Assume that the
derivative df (x0 ) ∈ Rm×n has rank r. Then there is an open neighborhood
U0 of x0 in U , an open neighborhood V0 of f (x0 ) in V , a diffeomorphism
ϕ : U1 × U2 ⊂ Rr × Rn−r , a diffeomorphism ψ : V0 → U1 × V2 ⊂ Rr × Rm−r ,
such that ϕ(x0 ) = (0, 0), ψ(f (x0 )) = (0, 0), and
ψ −1 ◦ f ◦ ϕ(x, y) = (x, g(x, y))

and

dg(0, 0) = 0

for (x, y) ∈ U1 × U2 .
The Local Normal Form Theorem is an easy consequence of the Inverse
Function Theorem.

A.2. NORMAL FORMS

413

Theorem A.2.2 (Inverse Function Theorem). Let U ⊂ Rn , V ⊂ Rm ,
x0 ∈ U and f : U → V be a smooth map. If df (x0 ) is invertible, then (m = n
and) there are neighborhoods U0 of x0 in U and V0 of f (x0 ) in V so that the
restriction f|U0 : U0 → V0 is a diffeomorphism.
Here follow some other consequences of the Inverse Function Theorem.
The terms submersion and immersion are defined in §2.6.1 and Definition 2.3.2 of §2.3.
Corollary A.2.3 (Submersion Theorem). When r = m the diffeomorphisms ϕ and ψ in Theorem A.2.1 may be chosen so that the local normal
form is
ψ −1 ◦ f ◦ ϕ(x, y) = x.
Corollary A.2.4 (Immersion Theorem). When r = n the diffeomorphisms ϕ and ψ in Theorem A.2.1 may be chosen so that the local normal
form is
ψ −1 ◦ f ◦ ϕ(x) = (x, 0).
Corollary A.2.5 (Rank Theorem). If the rank of df (x) = r for all x ∈ U ,
then for every x0 ∈ U the diffeomorphisms ϕ and ψ in Theorem A.2.1 may
be chosen so that the local normal form is
ψ −1 ◦ f ◦ ϕ(x) = (x1 , . . . , xr , 0, . . . , 0).
Corollary A.2.6 (Implicit Function Theorem). Let U ⊂ Rm × Rn be
an open set, let F : U → Rn be smooth, and let (x0 , y0 ) ∈ U with x0 ∈ Rm
and y0 ∈ Rn . Define the partial derivative d2 F (x0 , y0 ) ∈ Rn×n by
d2 F (x0 , y0 )v :=

d
F (x0 , y0 + tv)
dt t=0

for v ∈ Rn . Assume that F (x0 , y0 ) = 0 and that d2 F (x0 , y0 ) is invertible.
Then there exist neighborhoods U0 of x0 in Rm and V0 of y0 in Rn and a
smooth map g : U0 → V0 such that
U0 × V0 ⊂ U,

g(x0 ) = y0

and
F (x, y) = 0
for x ∈ U0 and y ∈ V0 .

⇐⇒

y = g(x)

A.3

APPENDIX A. NOTES

Euclidean Spaces

This is the arena of Euclidean geometry; i.e. every figure which is studied in
Euclidean geometry is a subset of Euclidean space. To define it one could
proceed axiomatically as Euclid did; one would then verify that the axioms characterized Euclidean space by constructing “Cartesian Coordinate
Systems” which identify the n-dimensional Euclidean space E n with the ndimensional numerical space Rn . This program was carried out rigorously
by Hilbert. We shall adopt the mathematically simpler but philosophically
less satisfying course of taking the characterization as the definition.
We shall use three closely related spaces: n-dimensional Euclidean affine
space E n , n-dimensional Euclidean vector space En , and the space Rn of
all n-tuples of real numbers. The distinction among them is a bit pedantic,
especially if one views as the purpose of geometry the interpretation of
calculations on Rn . The purpose for distinguishing these three spaces is the
same as in elementary vector calculus; it aids geometric intuition. Here is
the precise definition.
Definition A.3.1. An n-dimensional Euclidean vector space is a real ndimensional vector space En equipped with a (real valued symmetric positive
definite) inner product En × En → R : (v, w) 7→ ⟨v, w⟩. An n-dimensional
Euclidean affine space consists of a set E n and an n-dimensional Euclidean
vector space En and maps
E n × E n → En : (p, q) 7→ p − q,
E n × En → E n : (p, v) 7→ p + v
satisfying the axioms
p + 0 = p,

p + (v + w) = (p + v) + w,

q + (p − q) = p

for all p, q ∈ E n and all v, w ∈ En . The vector p − q ∈ En is called the
vector from q to p and the point p + v is called the translate of p by v.
It follows easily that each choice of a point o ∈ E n determines a bijection
v 7→ o + v from En onto E n . The inner product on En equips the space E n
with a metric via the formula
p
|p − q| = ⟨p − q, p − q⟩,
p, q ∈ En .
The standard Euclidean space of dimension n is E n = EnP
= Rn with the
i
i
i
usual matrix algebra operations (x ± y) = x ± y , ⟨x, y⟩ = i xi y i .

A.3. EUCLIDEAN SPACES

Lemma A.3.2. Any choice of an origin o ∈ E n and an orthonormal basis e1 , . . . , en for En determines an isometric bijection:
n

n

1

n

R → E : (x , . . . , x ) 7→ o +

n
X

xi ei

i=1

(the inverse of which is called a Cartesian coordinate system on E n ).
Lemma A.3.3. If E n → Rn : p 7→ (x1 , . . . , xn ), (y 1 , . . . , y n ) are two Cartesian coordinate systems, the change of coordinates map has the form
y j (p) =

n
X
aji xi (p) + v i ,
j=1

where the matrix a = (aji ) ∈ Rn×n is an orthogonal matrix and v ∈ Rn .
Example A.3.4. Any n-dimensional affine subspace of some numerical
space Rk (with k > n) is an example of a Euclidean space. The corresponding vector space En is the unique vector subspace of Rk for which:
E n = o + En
for o ∈ E n . This subspace is independent of the choice of o ∈ E n . Note
that En contains the “preferred” point 0 while E n has no preferred point.
Such spaces E n and En would arise in linear algebra by taking E n to be
the space of solutions of k − n independent inhomogeneous linear equations
in k unknowns while En is the space of solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equations. The correspondence between E n and En illustrates
the mantra
The general solution of an inhomogeneous system of linear equations is a particular solution plus the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous linear system.
This discussion shows that a Euclidean space E n is an n-dimensional
manifold with its Cartesian coordinate systems whose tangent space at each
point is naturally isomorphic to En . Thus it is natural to introduce submanifolds of Euclidean space as submanifolds of E n whose tangent spaces
are then linear subspaces of the associated vector space En . Instead we have
chosen in this book for simplicity of the exposition to describe manifolds as
subsets of the vector space Rn equipped with its standard inner product.
