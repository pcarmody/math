Graduate Texts in Physics
Graduate Texts in Physics publishes core learning/teaching material for graduate- and advanced-level undergraduate courses on topics of current and emerging fields within physics,
both pure and applied. These textbooks serve students at the MS- or PhD-level and their
instructors as comprehensive sources of principles, definitions, derivations, experiments and
applications (as relevant) for their mastery and teaching, respectively. International in scope
and relevance, the textbooks correspond to course syllabi sufficiently to serve as required
reading. Their didactic style, comprehensiveness and coverage of fundamental material also
make them suitable as introductions or references for scientists entering, or requiring timely
knowledge of, a research field.

Preface

Physics and mathematics students are as eager as ever to become acquainted with
the foundations of general relativity and some of its major applications in astrophysics and cosmology. I hope that this textbook gives a comprehensive and timely
introduction to both aspects of this fascinating field, and will turn out to be useful
for undergraduate and graduate students.
This book is a complete revision and extension of my previous volume ‘General
Relativity and Relativistic Astrophysics’ that appeared about twenty years ago in the
Springer Series ‘Texts and Monographs in Physics’; however, it cannot be regarded
just as a new edition.
In Part I the foundations of general relativity are thoroughly developed. Some of
the more advanced topics, such as the section on the initial value problem, can be
skipped in a first reading.
Part II is devoted to tests of general relativity and many of its applications. Binary
pulsars—our best laboratories for general relativity—are studied in considerable
detail. I have included an introduction to gravitational lensing theory, to the extent
that the current literature on the subject should become accessible. Much space is
devoted to the study of compact objects, especially to black holes. This includes a
detailed derivation of the Kerr solution, Israel’s proof of his uniqueness theorem,
and a derivation of the basic laws of black hole physics. Part II ends with Witten’s
proof of the positive energy theorem.
All the required differential geometric tools are developed in Part III. Readers who have not yet studied a modern mathematical text on differential geometry
should not read this part in linear order. I always indicate in the physics parts which
mathematical sections are going to be used at a given point of the discussion. For
example, Cartan’s powerful calculus of differential forms is not heavily used in the
foundational chapters. The mathematical part should also be useful for other fields
of physics. Differential geometric and topological tools play an increasingly important role, not only in quantum field theory and string theory, but also in classical
disciplines (mechanics, field theory).
A textbook on a field as developed and extensive as general relativity must make
painful omissions. When the book was approaching seven hundred pages, I had to
v

Preface

give up the original plan to also include cosmology. This is really deplorable, since
cosmology is going through a fruitful and exciting period. On the other hand, this
omission may not be too bad, since several really good texts on various aspects of
cosmology have recently appeared. Some of them are listed in the references. Quantum field theory on curved spacetime backgrounds is not treated at all. Other topics
have often been left out because my emphasis is on direct physical applications of
the theory. For this reason nothing is said, for instance, about black holes with hair
(although I worked on this for several years).
The list of references is not very extensive. Beside some useful general sources
on mathematical, physical, and historical subjects, I often quoted relatively recent
reviews and articles that may be most convenient for the reader to penetrate deeper
into various topics. Pedagogical reasons often have priority in my restrictive selection of references.
The present textbook would presumably not have been written without the enduring help of Thiemo Kessel. He not only typed very carefully the entire manuscript,
but also urged me at many places to give further explanations or provide additional
information. Since—as an undergraduate student—he was able to understand all the
gory details, I am now confident that the book is readable. I thank him for all his
help.
I also thank the many students I had over the years from the University of Zurich
and the ETH for their interest and questions. This feedback was essential in writing
the present book. Many of the exercises posed in the text have been solved in my
classes.
Finally, I would like to thank the Tomalla Foundation and the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the University of Zurich for financial support.
Post Script I would be grateful for suggestions of all kind and lists of mistakes.
Since I adopted—contrary to my habits—the majority convention for the signature
of the metric, I had to change thousands of signs. It is unlikely that no sign errors
remained, especially in spinorial equations.

Preface to the Second Edition

The present edition is a thorough revision of my book on general relativity that
appeared in 2004 in the Springer Series “Text and Monographs in Physics”. I hope
that almost no errors have survived.
A lot of effort went into refining and improving the text. Furthermore, new material has been added. Beside some updates, for instance on the marvellous double
pulsar system, and many smaller additions, the following sections have been added:
Sect. 2.11 General Relativistic Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics; Sect. 3.10 Domain of Dependence and Propagation of Matter Disturbances; Sect. 3.11 Boltzmann Equation in GR; most of Sect. 8.6.4: The First Law of Black Hole Dynamics;
Sect. 15.11 Covariant Derivatives of Tensor Densities.
As in the previous edition, space did not allow me to give an adequate introduction to the vast field of modern cosmology. But I have now at least added a concise
treatment of the Friedmann–Lemaître models, together with some crucial observations which can be described within this idealized class of cosmological models.
Solutions to some of the more difficult exercises have been included, as well as
new exercises (often with solutions).
In preparing this new edition, I have benefited from suggestions, criticism, and
advice by students and colleagues. Eric Sheldon read the entire first edition and
suggested lots of improvements of my Swiss influenced use of English. Particular
thanks go to Domenico Giulini for detailed constructive criticism and help. Positive
reactions by highly estimated colleagues—especially by the late Juergen Ehlers—
encouraged me to invest the energy for this new edition.

The General Theory of Relativity

Chapter 1

Introduction

I worked horribly strenuously, strange that one can endure that.
—A. Einstein
(On a postcard to his friend M. Besso in Nov. 1915)

The discovery of the general theory of relativity (GR) has often been justly
praised as one of the greatest intellectual achievements of a single human being. At
the ceremonial presentation of Hubacher’s bust of A. Einstein in Zürich, W. Pauli
said:
The general theory of relativity then completed and—in contrast to the special theory—
worked out by Einstein alone without simultaneous contributions by other researchers, will
forever remain the classic example of a theory of perfect beauty in its mathematical structure.

Let us also quote M. Born:
(The general theory of relativity) seemed and still seems to me at present to be the greatest
accomplishment of human thought about nature; it is a most remarkable combination of
philosophical depth, physical intuition and mathematical ingenuity. I admire it as a work of
art.

The origin of the GR is all the more remarkable when one considers that, aside
from a minute advance of the perihelion of Mercury, that remained in the data after
all perturbations in the Newtonian theory had been accounted for, no experimental
necessity for going beyond the Newtonian theory of gravitation existed. Purely theoretical considerations led to the genesis of GR. The Newtonian law of gravitation
as an action-at-a-distance law is not compatible with the special theory of relativity.
Einstein and other workers were thus forced to try to develop a relativistic theory of
gravitation. It is remarkable that Einstein was soon convinced that gravitation has
no place in the framework of special relativity. In his lecture On the Origins of the
General Theory of Relativity Einstein enlarged on this subject as follows:
I came a first step closer to a solution of the problem when I tried to treat the law of
gravitation within the framework of special relativity theory. Like most authors at that time,
I tried to formulate a field law for gravity, since the introduction of action at a distance
was no longer possible, at least in any natural way, due to the elimination of the concept of
absolute simultaneity.

Introduction

The simplest and most natural procedure was to retain the scalar Laplacian gravitational
potential and to add a time derivative to the Poisson equation in such a way that the requirements of the special theory would be satisfied. In addition, the law of motion for a
point mass in a gravitational field had to be adjusted to the requirements of special relativity. Just how to do this was not so clear, since the inertial mass of a body might depend
on the gravitational potential. In fact, this was to be expected in view of the principle of
mass-energy equivalence.
However, such considerations led to a result which made me extremely suspicious. According to classical mechanics, the vertical motion of a body in a vertical gravitational field is
independent of the horizontal motion. This is connected with the fact that in such a gravitational field the vertical acceleration of a mechanical system, or of its center of mass, is
independent of its kinetic energy. Yet, according to the theory which I was investigating, the
gravitational acceleration was not independent of the horizontal velocity or of the internal
energy of the system.
This in turn was not consistent with the well known experimental fact that all bodies experience the same acceleration in a gravitational field. This law, which can also be formulated
as the law of equality of inertial and gravitational mass, now struck me in its deep significance. I wondered to the highest degree about its validity and supposed it to be the key to a
deeper understanding of inertia and gravitation. I did not seriously doubt its strict validity
even without knowing the result of the beautiful experiment of Eötvös, which—if I remember correctly—I only heard of later. I now gave up my previously described attempt to treat
gravitation in the framework of the special theory as inadequate. It obviously did not do
justice to precisely the most fundamental property of gravitation.

In the first chapter we shall discuss several arguments to convince the reader that
a satisfactory theory of gravitation cannot be formulated within the framework of
the special theory of relativity.
After nearly ten years of hard work, Einstein finally completed the general theory
of relativity in November 1915. How hard he struggled with the theory is indicated
by the following passage in a letter to A. Sommerfeld:
At present I occupy myself exclusively with the problem of gravitation and now believe
that I shall master all difficulties with the help of a friendly mathematician here (Marcel
Grossmann). But one thing is certain, in all my life I have never labored nearly as hard, and
I have become imbued with great respect for mathematics, the subtler part of which I had
in my simple-mindedness regarded as pure luxury until now. Compared with this problem,
the original relativity is child’s play.

In GR the rigid spacetime structure of the special theory of relativity (SR) is generalized. Einstein arrived at this generalization on the basis of his principle of equivalence, according to which gravitation can be “locally” transformed away in a freely
falling, non-rotating system. (In the space age, this has become obvious to everybody.) This means that on an infinitesimal scale, relative to a locally inertial system,
such as we have just described, special relativity remains valid. The metric field of
the SR varies, however, over finite regions of spacetime. Expressed mathematically,
spacetime is described by a (differentiable) pseudo-Riemannian manifold. The metric field g has the signature1 (− + ++) and describes not only the metric properties
of space and time as well as its causality properties, but also the gravitational field.
The physical metric field is thus curved and dynamical, both influencing and being

influenced by all other physical processes. In this sense GR unifies geometry and
gravitation, whence the name geometrodynamics, coined by J.A. Wheeler, is indeed
appropriate. Einstein had this profound insight some time during the summer 1912.
The theory consists of two main parts. The first describes the action of gravity
on other physical processes. In collaboration with M. Grossmann, Einstein soon
succeeded in generalizing non-gravitational (matter) laws, such as Maxwell’s equations. The coupling of matter variables to gravitational fields is largely determined
by the equivalence principle. This will be discussed extensively in Chap. 2. Briefly,
this comes about as follows.
It is a mathematical fact that in a Lorentz manifold one can introduce (normal) coordinates such that, at a given point p, the metric takes the normal form
(gμν (p)) = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1), and in addition its components have vanishing first
derivatives: gμν,λ (p) = 0. Relative to such a coordinate system, the gravitational
field is locally transformed away (up to higher order inhomogeneities). The kinematical structure of GR thus permits locally inertial systems. According to the equivalence principle, the laws of SR (for example, Maxwell’s equations) should hold in
such systems. This requirement permits one to formulate the non-gravitational laws
in the presence of a gravitational field. Mathematically this amounts to the substitution of ordinary derivatives by covariant derivatives. The equivalence principle
thus prescribes—up to certain ambiguities—the coupling of mechanical, electromagnetic and other systems to external gravitational fields. This corner stone enabled Einstein to derive important results, such as the gravitational redshift of light,
long before the theory was completed.
Conversely, the metric field depends on the energy-momentum distribution of
all forms of matter. This dependence is expressed in Einstein’s field equations—the
hard core of the theory—which relates the curvature of spacetime to the energymomentum tensor of matter. Einstein discovered these highly nonlinear partial differential equations after a long and difficult search, and showed that they are almost
uniquely determined by only a few requirements. At the same time, he recognized
that his new theory reduces in lowest order to the Newtonian one for the case of
quasistationary weak fields and slowly changing matter sources (and test particles).
In particular, Newton’s 1/r 2 law is an unavoidable consequence of GR. The new
field theory of gravity also described deviations from Newtonian theory, in particular the anomalous precession of the perihelion of Mercury. Einstein once said about
his intellectual odyssey:
In the light of present knowledge, these achievements seem to be almost obvious, and every
intelligent student grasps them without much trouble. Yet the years of anxious searching in
the dark, with their intense longing, their alternations of confidence and exhaustion and the
final emergence into the light—only those who have experienced this can understand it.

The history of Einstein’s struggle is by now well documented. Some particularly
valuable references are collected in the bibliography.2
Contrary to original expectations, GR had little immediate influence on further
progress in physics. With the development of quantum mechanics, the theory of

Introduction

matter and electromagnetism took a direction which had little connection with the
ideas of GR. (Einstein himself, and some other important physicists, did not participate in these developments and clung to classical field concepts.) Nothing would
indicate that such phenomena would not be compatible with special relativity. This
was one of the reasons that progress in GR slowed. Another was that for a long
time no really novel observations were made for which Newtonian theory would be
inadequate.
The situation changed radically with an incredible chain of important astronomical discoveries in the 1960s and 1970s which brought GR and relativistic astrophysics to the forefront of present day research in physics. We now know that objects having extremely strong gravitational field exist in the Universe. Catastrophic
events, such as stellar collapse or explosions in the centers of active galaxies give
rise to not only strong, but also rapidly varying, gravitational fields. This is where
GR finds its proper applications. For sufficiently massive objects, gravitation dominates at some point over all other interactions, due to its universally attractive and
long range character. Not even the most repulsive nuclear forces can always prevent the final collapse to a black hole. So-called horizons appear in the spacetime
geometry, behind which matter disappears and thus, for all practical purposes of
physics and astrophysics, ceases to exist. For such dramatic events GR must be used
in its full ramifications, and is no longer merely a small correction to the Newtonian
theory. The observational evidence for black holes in some X-ray binary systems,
as well as for supermassive black holes in galactic centers is still indirect, but has
become overwhelming. We are undoubtedly in the middle of a truly Golden Age of
astrophysics and cosmology.
As a result of these astronomical observations, theorists have performed relevant investigations on the stability of gravitating systems, gravitational collapse, the
physics of black holes, the emission of gravitational radiation, and other applied
fields of GR have been created and are further developed. Soon we shall have a
gravitational wave astronomy, allowing us to study highly dynamical strong field
processes, like the coalescence of black holes. Here Einstein’s equations come into
play in their full glory.3 Surely, gravitation wave searches will again strengthen the
interplay of theory and experiment. Cosmology is another observationally driven,
rapidly expanding area where GR plays a crucial role.
It is now widely recognized that GR is a non-Abelian gauge theory of a special
type, in that it has a common geometrical structure with the gauge theories of particle physics.4 In all these theories spacetime-dependent invariance principles specify
the dynamics. In most unification attempts beyond the Standard Model of particle
physics, gravity is an essential and unavoidable part. Also for this reason, particle
physicists should nowadays have a good knowledge of GR and its differential geometric methods.

3 In the investigations of such complex phenomena, numerical relativity plays an increasingly important role. Fortunately, there now exist text books on this vast field [19, 20].
4 For a historically oriented account of this, see [66].

Physics in External Gravitational Fields

I was made aware of these (works by Ricci and Levi-Civita) by my friend Grossmann in
Zürich, when I put to him the problem to investigate generally covariant tensors, whose
components depend only on the derivatives of the coefficients of the quadratic fundamental
form.
—A. Einstein (1955)

We already emphasized in the introduction that the principle of equivalence is one
of the foundation pillars of the general theory of relativity. It leads naturally to the
kinematical framework of general relativity and determines, suitable interpreted, the
coupling of physical systems to external gravitational fields. This will be discussed
in detail in the present chapter.

2.1 Characteristic Properties of Gravitation
Among the known fundamental interactions only the electromagnetic and gravitational are of long range, thus permitting a classical description in the macroscopic
limit. While there exists a highly successful quantum electrodynamics, a (unified)
quantum description of gravity remains a fundamental theoretical task.

2.1.1 Strength of the Gravitational Interaction
Gravity is by far the weakest of the four fundamental interactions. If we compare
for instance the gravitational and electrostatic force between two protons, we find in
obvious notation

is huge in comparison to known mass scales of particle physics. The numerical factor on the right in Eq. (2.1) is equal to α −1 m2p /MP2 l , where α = e2 /c ≃ 1/137 is
the fine structure constant. Quite generally, gravitational effects in atomic physics
are suppressed in comparison to electromagnetic ones by factors of the order
α n (m/MP l )2 , where m = me , mp , . . . and n = 0, ±1, . . . . There is thus no chance to
measure gravitational effects on the atomic scale. Gravity only becomes important
for astronomical bodies. For sufficiently large masses it sooner or later predominates over all other interactions and will lead to the catastrophic collapse to a black
hole. One can show (see Chap. 7) that this is always the case for stars having a mass
greater than about

where mN is the nucleon mass. Gravity wins because it is not only long range, but
also universally attractive. (By comparison, the electromagnetic forces cancel to a
large extent due to the alternating signs of the charges, and the exclusion principle
for the electrons.) In addition, not only matter, but also antimatter, and every other
form of energy acts as a source for gravitational fields. At the same time, gravity
also acts on all forms of energy.

2.1.2 Universality of Free Fall
Since the time of Galilei, we learned with increasing precision that all test bodies
fall at the same rate. This means that for an appropriate choice of units, the inertial mass is equal to the gravitational mass. Newton established that the “weight”
of a body (its response to gravity) is proportional to the “quantity of matter” in it
already to better than a part in 1000. He achieved this with two pendulums, each
11 feet long ending in a wooden box. One was a reference; into the other he put
successively “gold, silver, lead, glass, common salt, wood, water and wheat”. Careful observations showed that the times of swing are independent of the material. In
Newton’s words:
And by experiments made with the greatest accuracy, I have always found the quantity of
matter in bodies to be proportional to their weight.

In Newton’s theory of gravity there is no explanation for this remarkable fact.
A violation would not upset the conceptual basis of the theory. As we have seen in

2.1 Characteristic Properties of Gravitation

the introduction, Einstein was profoundly astonished by this fact.1 The equality of
the inertial and gravitational masses has been experimentally established with an accuracy of one part in 1012 (For a review, see [96]). This remarkable fact suggests the
validity of the following universality of free fall, also called the Weak Equivalence
Principle:
Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) The motion of a test body in a gravitational
field is independent of its mass and composition (at least when one neglects interactions of spin or of a quadrupole moment with field gradients).
For the Newtonian theory, universality is of course a consequence of the equality
of inertial and gravitational masses. We postulate that it holds generally, in particular
also for large velocities and strong fields.

2.1.3 Equivalence Principle
The equality of inertial and gravitational masses provides experimental support for
a stronger version of the principle of equivalence.
Einstein’s Equivalence Principle (EEP) In an arbitrary gravitational field no local non-gravitational experiment can distinguish a freely falling nonrotating system
(local inertial system) from a uniformly moving system in the absence of a gravitational field.
Briefly, we may say that gravity can be locally transformed away.2 Today of
course, this is a well known fact to anyone who has watched space flight on television.
Remarks
1. The EEP implies (among other things) that inertia and gravity cannot be
(uniquely) separated.
1 In popular lectures which have only recently been published [70], H. Hertz said about inertial and

gravitational mass:
And in reality we do have two properties before us, two most fundamental properties of
matter, which must be thought as being completely independent of each other, but in our experience, and only in our experience, appear to be exactly equal. This correspondence must
mean much more than being just a miracle . . . . We must clearly realize, that the proportionality between mass and inertia must have a deeper explanation and cannot be considered
as of little importance, just as in the case of the equality of the velocities of electrical and
optical waves.
2 This ‘infinitesimal formulation’ of the priniple of equivalence was first introduced by Pauli in
1921, [1, 2], p. 145. Einstein dealt only with the very simple case of homogeneous gravitational
fields. For a detailed historical discussion, we refer to [81].

10

2. The formulation of the EEP is somewhat vague, since it is not entirely clear what
is meant by a local experiment. At this point, the principle is thus of a heuristic
nature. We shall soon translate it into a mathematical requirement.
3. The EEP is even for test bodies stronger than the universality of free fall, as can
be seen from the following example. Consider a fictitious world in which, by
a suitable choice of units, the electric charge is equal to the mass of the particles and in which there are no negative charges. In a classical framework, there
are no objections to such a theory, and by definition, the universality property
is satisfied. However, the principle of equivalence is not satisfied. Consider a
homogeneous magnetic field. Since the radii and axes of the spiral motion are
arbitrary, there is no transformation to an accelerated frame of reference which
can remove the effect of the magnetic field on all particles at the same time.
4. We do not discuss here the so-called strong equivalence principle (SEP) which
includes self-gravitating bodies and experiments involving gravitational forces
(e.g., Cavendish experiments). Interested readers are referred to [8] and [96].

2.1.4 Gravitational Red- and Blueshifts
An almost immediate consequence of the EEP is the gravitational redshift (or
blueshift) effect. (Originally, Einstein regarded this as a crucial test of GR.) Following Einstein, we consider an elevator cabin in a static gravitational field. For
simplicity, we consider a homogeneous field of strength (acceleration) g, but the result (2.4) below also applies for inhomogeneous fields; this is obvious if the height
H of the elevator is taken to be infinitesimal. Suppose the elevator cabin is dropped
from rest at time t = 0, and that at the same time a photon of frequency ν is emitted
from its ceiling toward the floor (see Fig. 2.1). The EEP implies two things:
(a) The light arrives at a point A of the floor at time t = H /c;
(b) no frequency shift is observed in the freely falling cabin.

2.1 Characteristic Properties of Gravitation

energy

Consider beside A an observer B at rest in the shaft at the same height as the point
A of the floor when the photon arrives there. Clearly, B moves relative to A with
velocity v ≃ gt (neglecting higher order terms in t). Therefore, B sees the light
Doppler shifted to the blue by the amount (in first order)3

If we write this as

(2.4)
c2
where Δφ is the difference in the Newtonian potential between the receiver and
the emitter at rest at different heights, the formula also holds for inhomogeneous
gravitational fields to first order in Δφ/c2 . (The exact general relativistic formula
will be derived in Sect. 2.9.)
Since the early 1960s the consequence (2.4) of the EEP has been tested with
increasing accuracy. The most precise result so far was achieved with a rocket experiment that brought a hydrogen-maser clock to an altitude of about 10,000 km.
The data confirmed the prediction (2.4) to an accuracy of 2 × 10−4 . Gravitational
redshift effects are routinely taken into account for Earth-orbiting clocks, such as
for the Global Positioning System (GPS). For further details see [96].
At the time when Einstein formulated his principle of equivalence in 1907, the
prediction (2.4) could not be directly verified. Einstein was able to convince himself
of its validity indirectly, since (2.4) is also a consequence of the conservation of energy. To see this, consider two points A and B, with separation H in a homogeneous
gravitational field (see Fig. 2.2). Let a mass m fall with initial velocity zero from A
to B. According to the Newtonian theory, it has the kinetic energy mgH at point B.
Now let us assume that at B the entire energy of the falling body (rest energy plus
kinetic energy) is annihilated to a photon, which subsequently returns to the point A.
If the photon did not interact with the gravitational field, we could convert it back

same measurements as a freely falling (inertial) observer B  momentarily at rest relative to B.

to the mass m and gain the energy mgH in each cycle of such process. In order
to preserve the conservation of energy, the photon must experience a redshift. Its
energy must satisfy

in perfect agreement with (2.4).

2.2 Special Relativity and Gravitation
That the special theory of relativity is only the first step of a necessary development became
completely clear to me only in my efforts to represent gravitation in the framework of this
theory.
—A. Einstein
(Autobiographical Notes, 1949)

From several later recollections and other sources we know that Einstein recognized
very early that gravity does not fit naturally into the framework of special relativity.
In this section, we shall discuss some arguments which demonstrate that this is
indeed the case.

where ημν is the Minkowski metric. In the presence of a gravitational field, (2.5)
can no longer be valid, as is shown by the following argument.
Consider a redshift experiment in the Earth’s gravitational field and assume that
a special relativistic theory of gravity exists, which need not be further specified
here. For such an experiment we may neglect all masses other than that of the Earth
and regard the Earth as being at rest relative to some inertial system. In a spacetime
diagram (height z above the Earth’s surface versus time), the Earth’s surface, the
emitter and the absorber all move along world lines of constant z (see Fig. 2.3).

2.2 Special Relativity and Gravitation

Fig. 2.3 Redshift in the
Earth field

The transmitter is supposed to emit at a fixed frequency from S1 to S2 . The photons registered by the absorber move along world lines γ1 and γ2 , that are not necessarily straight lines at an angle of 45◦ , due to a possible interaction with the gravitational field, but must be parallel, since we are dealing with a static situation. Thus,
if the flat Minkowski geometry holds and the time measurement is given by (2.5),
it follows that the time difference between S1 and S2 must be equal to the time difference between A1 and A2 . Thus, there would be no redshift. This shows that at
the very least (2.5) is no longer valid. The argument does not exclude the possibility
that the metric gμν might be proportional to ημν . (This possibility will be rejected
below.)

2.2.2 Global Inertial Systems Cannot Be Realized in the Presence
of Gravitational Fields
In Newtonian–Galileian mechanics and in special relativity, the law of inertia distinguishes a special class of equivalent frames of reference (inertial systems). Due
to the universality of gravitation, only the free fall of electrically neutral test bodies
can be regarded as particularly distinguished motion in the presence of gravitational
fields. Such bodies experience, however, relative accelerations. There is no operational procedure to uniquely separate inertia and gravitation. In spite of this, the
fiction of a linear affine Galilei spacetime (with a flat affine connection) is maintained in the traditional presentation of Newton’s theory,4 and gravity is put on the
side of the forces. But since the concept of an inertial system cannot be defined
operationally, we are deprived of an essential foundation of the special theory of
relativity.
We no longer have any reason to describe spacetime as a linear affine space.
The absolute, integrable affine structure of the spacetime manifold in Newtonian–
Galilean mechanics and in special relativity was, after all, suggested by the law of
4 A more satisfactory formulation was given by E. Cartan, [67, 68] and K. Friederichs, [69] (see

also Exercise 3.2).

14

inertia. A more satisfactory theory should account for inertia and gravity in terms
of a single, indecomposable structure.

2.2.3 Gravitational Deflection of Light Rays
Consider again the famous Einstein elevator cabin in an elevator shaft attached to
the Earth, and a light ray emitted perpendicular to the direction of motion of the
freely falling cabin. According to the principle of equivalence, the light ray propagates along a straight line inside the cabin relative to the cabin. Since the elevator
is accelerated relative to the Earth, one expects that the light ray propagates along
a parabolic path relative to the Earth. This consequence of the EEP holds, a priori,
only locally. It does not necessarily imply bending of light rays from a distant source
traversing the gravitational field of a massive body and arriving at a distant observer.
Indeed, we shall see later that it is possible to construct a theory which satisfies the
principle of equivalence, but in which there is no deflection of light. (For a detailed
discussion of how this comes about, see [95].) At any rate, the deflection of light is
an experimental fact (the precise magnitude of the effect does not concern us at the
moment).
It is therefore not possible to describe the gravitational field (as in the Einstein–
Fokker theory, discussed in Sect. 3.2) in terms of a conformally flat metric, i.e., by a
metric field proportional to the Minkowski metric: gμν (x) = φ(x)ημν , where φ(x)
plays the role of the gravitational potential. Indeed, for such a metric the light cones
are the same as in the Minkowski spacetime; hence, there is no light deflection.

2.2.4 Theories of Gravity in Flat Spacetime
I see the most essential thing in the overcoming of the inertial system, a thing that acts upon
all processes, but undergoes no reaction. This concept is, in principle, no better than that of
the center of the universe in Aristotelian physics.
—A. Einstein (1954)

In spite of these arguments one may ask, how far one gets with a theory of gravity in
Minkowski spacetime, following the pattern of well understood field theories, such
as electrodynamics. Attempts along these lines have a long tradition, and are quite
instructive. Readers with some background in special relativistic (classical) field
theory should find the following illuminating. One may, however, jump directly to
the conclusion at the end of this subsection (p. 18).
Scalar Theory
Let us first try a scalar theory. This simplest possibility was studied originally by
Einstein, von Laue, and others, but was mainly developed by G. Nordstrøm, [62–
64].

2.2 Special Relativity and Gravitation

15

The field equation for the scalar field ϕ, generalizing the Newtonian potential, in
the limit of weak fields (linear field equation) is unique:
ϕ = −4πGT .

(2.6)

Here, T denotes the trace of the energy-momentum tensor T μν of matter. For a
Newtonian situation this reduces to the Poisson equation.
We formulate the equation of motion of a test particle in terms of a Lagrangian.
For weak fields this is again unique:



L x μ , ẋ μ = − −ημν ẋ μ ẋ ν (1 + ϕ),
(2.7)
because only for this the Newtonian limit for weak static fields and small velocities
of the test bodies comes out right:
1
L(x, ẋ) ≈ ẋ 2 − ϕ + const.
2
The basic equations (2.6) and (2.7) imply a perihelion motion of the planets, but
this comes out wrong, even the sign is incorrect. One finds (−1/6) times the value
of general relativity (see Exercise 2.3). In spite of this failure we add some further
instructive remarks.
First, we want to emphasize that the interaction is necessarily attractive, independent of the matter content. To show this, we start from the general form of the
Lagrangian density for the scalar theory
1
L = − ∂μ φ∂ μ φ + gT · φ + Lmat ,
2

(2.8)

where φ is proportional to ϕ and g is a coupling constant. Note first that only g 2 is
significant: Setting φ̃ = gφ, we have
L=−

1
∂μ φ̃∂ μ φ̃ + T · φ̃ + Lmat ,
2g 2

involving only g 2 . Next, it has to be emphasized that it is not allowed to replace
g 2 by −g 2 , otherwise the field energy of the gravitational field would be negative.
(This “solution” of the energy problem does not work.) Finally, we consider the field
energy for static sources.
The total (canonical) energy-momentum tensor
T νμ = −

∂L
φ,ν + · · · + δ μν L
∂φ,μ

gives for the φ-contribution
1
(Tφ )μν = ∂μ φ∂ν φ − ημν ∂λ φ∂ λ φ + ημν gT φ.
2
For the corresponding total energy we find

both for fermion-fermion and fermion-antifermion interactions. The same result is
found for the exchange of massless spin-2 particles, while for spin-1 we obtain
repulsion between particles, and attraction between particles and antiparticles (see
Exercise 2.4).
The scalar theory predicted that there is no light deflection, simply because the
trace of the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor vanishes. For this reason Einstein urged in 1913 astronomers (E. Freundlich in Potsdam) to measure the light
deflection during the solar eclipse the coming year in the Crimea. Shortly before
the event the first world war broke out. Over night Freundlich and his German colleagues were captured as prisoners of war and it took another five years before the
light deflection was observed. For further discussion of the scalar theory we refer to
[97], and references therein.

Tensor (spin-2) Theory
We are led to study the spin-2 option. (There are no consistent higher spin equations
with interaction.) This means that we try to describe the gravitational field by a
symmetric tensor field hμν . Such a field has 10 components. On the other hand, we
learned from Wigner that in the massless case there are only two degrees of freedom.
How do we achieve the truncation from 10 to 2?
Recall first the situation in the massive case. There we can require that the trace
μ
h = h μ vanishes, and then the field hμν transforms with respect to the homogeneous Lorentz group irreducibly as D (1,1) (in standard notation). With respect to the

2.2 Special Relativity and Gravitation

17

subgroup of rotations this reduces to the reducible representation
D1 ⊗ D1 = D2 ⊕ D1 ⊕ D0.
The corresponding unwanted spin-1 and spin-0 components are then eliminated by
imposing 4 subsidiary conditions
∂μ hμν = 0.
The remaining 5 degrees of freedom describe (after quantization) massive spin-2
particles (W. Pauli and M. Fierz, [98, 99]; see, e.g., the classical book [22]).
In the massless case we have to declare certain classes of fields as physically
equivalent, by imposing—as in electrodynamics—a gauge invariance. The gauge
transformations are
hμν −→ hμν + ∂μ ξν + ∂ν ξμ ,

(2.10)

where ξμ is an arbitrary vector field.
Let us first consider the free spin-2 theory which is unique (W. Pauli and M.
Fierz)

(2.12)

The free field equations
Gμν = 0

(2.13)

are identical to the linearized Einstein equations (as shown in Sect. 5.1) and describe, for instance, the propagation of weak gravitational fields.
The gauge invariance of L (modulo a divergence) implies the identity
∂ν Gμν ≡ 0,

“linearized Bianchi identity”.

(2.14)

This should be regarded in analogy to the identity ∂μ (Aμ − ∂ μ ∂ν Aν ) ≡ 0 for the
left-hand side of Maxwell’s equations.
Let us now introduce couplings to matter. The simplest possibility is the linear
coupling

This can, however, not yet be the final equation, but only an approximation for
weak fields. Indeed, the identity (2.14) implies ∂ν T μν = 0 which is unacceptable (in
contrast to the charge conservation of electrodynamics). For instance, the motion of
a fluid would then not at all be affected by the gravitational field. Clearly, we must
introduce a back-reaction on matter. Why not just add to T μν in (2.16) the energymomentum tensor (2) t μν which corresponds to the Pauli–Fierz Lagrangian (2.11)?
But this modified equation cannot be derived from a Lagrangian and is still not
consistent, but only the second step of an iteration process
Lf ree −→ (2) t μν −→ Lcubic −→ (3) t μν −→ · · · ?
The sequence of arrows has the following meaning: A Lagrangian which gives the
quadratic terms (2) t μν in
Gμν =


κ  μν (2) μν (3) μν
T + t + t + ···
2

(2.17)

must be cubic in hμν , and in turn leads to cubic terms (3) t μν of the gravitational
energy-momentum tensor. To produce these in the field equation (2.17), we need
quartic terms in hμν , etc. This is an infinite process. By a clever reorganization it
stops already after the second step, and one arrives at field equations which are
equivalent to Einstein’s equations (see [100]). The physical metric of GR is given in
terms of φ μν = hμν − 12 ημν h by
√
−gg μν = ημν − φ μν ,
(2.18)
where g := det(gμν ).
At this point one can reinterpret the theory geometrically. Thereby the flat metric
disappears completely and one arrives in a pedestrian way at GR. This approach
is further discussed in [97]. There it is also shown that gμν is really the physical
metric.
Conclusion The consequent development of the theory shows that it is possible to
eliminate the flat Minkowski metric, leading to a description in terms of a curved
metric which has a direct physical meaning. The originally postulated Lorentz invariance turns out to be physically meaningless and plays no useful role. The flat
Minkowski spacetime becomes a kind of unobservable ether. The conclusion is inevitable that spacetime is a pseudo-Riemannian (Lorentzian) manifold, whereby the
metric is a dynamical field, subjected to field equations.

particle with e = m. Show that a particle which, originally at rest, moves faster in
the vertical direction than a particle which was originally moving horizontally.

Exercise 2.2 Consider a self gravitating body (star) moving freely in the neighborhood of a black hole. Estimate at which distance D the star is disrupted by relative
forces due to inhomogeneities of the gravitational field (tidal forces).
Solution Relative gravitational accelerations in Newtonian theory are determined
by the second derivative of the Newtonian potential. A satellite with mass M and
radius R at distance r from a compact body (neutron star, black hole) of mass Mc

2.3 Spacetime as a Lorentzian Manifold
Either, therefore, the reality which underlies space must form a discrete manifold, or we
must seek the ground of its metric relations (measure conditions) outside it, in binding
forces which act upon it.
—B. Riemann (1854)

The discussion of Sect. 2.2 has shown that in the presence of gravitational fields
the spacetime description of SR has to be generalized. According to the EEP,
special relativity remains, however, valid in “infinitesimal” regions. This suggests
that the metric properties of spacetime have to be described by a symmetric tensor field gμν (p) for which it is not possible to find coordinate systems such that

20

2

Physics in External Gravitational Fields

gμν (p) = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1) in finite regions of spacetime. This should only be possible when no true gravitational fields are present. We therefore postulate: The mathematical model for spacetime (i.e., the set of all elementary events) in the presence
of gravitational fields is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold M, whose metric g has
the same signature as the Minkowski metric. The pair (M, g) is called a Lorentz
manifold and g is called a Lorentzian metric.
Remark At this point, readers who are not yet familiar with (pseudo-) Riemannian
geometry should study the following sections of the differential geometric part at
the end of the book: All of Chaps. 11 and 12, and Sects. 15.1–15.6. These form a
self-contained subset and suffice for most of the basic material covered in the first
two chapters (at least for a first reading). References to the differential geometric
Part III will be indicated by DG.
As for Minkowski spacetime, the metric g determines, beside the metric properties, also the causal relationships, as we shall see soon. At the same time, we also
interpret the metric field as the gravitational potential. In the present chapter our
goal is to describe how it influences non-gravitational systems and processes.
Among the metric properties, the generalization of (2.5) of the proper time interval for a timelike curve x μ (λ) (i.e., a curve with timelike tangent vectors) is

dλ.
(2.19)
Δτ =

λ1
A good (atomic) clock, moving along x μ (λ), measures this proper time.
The coupling of the metric to non-gravitational systems should satisfy two principles. First, the basic equations must have intrinsic meaning in (M, g). In other
words, they should be expressible in terms of the intrinsic calculus on Lorentz manifolds, developed in DG. Equivalently, the basic laws should not distinguish any
coordinate system. All charts of any atlas, belonging to the differential structure, are
on the same footing. One also says that the physical laws have to be covariant with
respect to smooth coordinate transformations (or are generally covariant). Let us
formulate this property more precisely:
Definition A system of equations is covariant with respect to the group G(M) of
(germs of) smooth coordinate transformations, provided that for any element of
G(M) the quantities appearing in the equations can be transformed to new quantities in such a way that
(i) the assignment preserves the group structure of G(M);
(ii) both the original and the transformed quantities satisfy the same system of equations.
Only generally covariant laws have an intrinsic meaning in the Lorentz manifold.
If a suitable calculus is used, these can be formulated in a coordinate-free manner.
The general covariance is at this point a matter of course. It should, however, not

2.4 Non-gravitational Laws in External Gravitational Fields

21

be confused with general invariance. The difference of the two concepts will be
clarified later when we shall consider the coupled dynamical system of metric plus
matter variables. It will turn out that general invariance is, like gauge invariance, a
powerful symmetry principle (see Sect. 3.5).
From DG, Sect. 15.3, we know that in a neighborhood of every point p a coordinate system exists, such that
gμν (p) = ημν

and gμν,λ (p) = 0,

(2.20)

where (ημν ) = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1). Such coordinates are said to be inertial or normal at
p, and are interpreted as locally inertial systems. We also say that such a coordinate
system is locally inertial with origin p. The metric g describes the behavior of
clocks and measuring sticks in such locally inertial systems, exactly as in special
relativity. Relative to such a system, the usual laws of electrodynamics, mechanics,
etc. in the special relativistic form are locally valid. The form of these laws for an
arbitrary system is to a large extent determined by the following two requirements
(we shall discuss possible ambiguities in Sect. 2.4.6):
(a) Aside from the metric and its derivatives, the laws should contain only quantities
which are also present in the special theory of relativity.5
(b) The laws must be generally covariant and reduce to the special relativistic form
at the origin of a locally inertial coordinate system.
These requirements provide a mathematical formulation of Einstein’s Equivalence Principle. We shall soon arrive at a more handy prescription.

2.4 Non-gravitational Laws in External Gravitational Fields
We now apply this mathematical formulation of the EEP and discuss possible ambiguities at the end of this section. Familiarity with the concept of covariant differentiation (DG, Sects. 15.1–15.6) will be assumed. We add here some remarks about
notation.
Remarks (Coordinate-free versus abstract index notation) Modern mathematical
texts on differential geometry usually make use of indices for vectors, tensors, etc.
only for their components relative to a local coordinate system or a frame, i.e. a local
basis of vector fields. If indices for the objects themselves are totally avoided, computations can, however, quickly become very cumbersome, especially when higher
rank tensors with all sorts of contractions are involved. For this reason, relativists
usually prefer what they call the abstract index notation. This has nothing to do with
coordinates or frames. For instance, instead of saying: “. . . let Ric be the Ricci tensor, u a vector field, and consider Ric(u, u) . . .”, one says: “. . . let Rμν be the Ricci
5 It is not permitted to introduce in addition to g

μν other “external” (absolute) elements such as a

22

2

Physics in External Gravitational Fields

tensor, uμ a vector field, and consider Rμν uμ uν , . . . .” In particular, the number and
positions of indices specify which type of tensor is considered, and repeated indices
indicate the type of contraction that is performed.
Some authors (e.g., R. Wald in his text book [9]) distinguish this abstract meaning
of indices from the usual component indices by using different alphabets. We do not
want to adopt this convention, since it should be clear from the context whether the
indices can be interpreted abstractly, or whether they refer to special coordinates
or frames which are adapted to a particular spacetime (with certain symmetries,
distinguished submanifolds, . . .).
When dealing, for example, with differential forms we often avoid abstract indices and follow the habits of mathematicians. We hope that the reader will not be
disturbed by our notational flexibility. After having studied the present subsection,
he should be familiar with our habits.

2.4.1 Motion of a Test Body in a Gravitational Field
What is the equation of motion of a freely falling test particle? Let γ (τ ) be its
timelike world line, parameterized by the proper time τ . According to (2.19) its

at p. This is just the geodesic equation (DG, Sect. 15.3), which is generally covariant. Therefore, Eq. (2.23) holds in any coordinate system. Moreover, since the point
p is arbitrary, it is valid along the entire orbit of the test body. In coordinate-free
notation it is equivalent to the statement that γ̇ is autoparallel along γ
∇γ̇ γ̇ = 0.

(2.24)

Note that (2.21) and (2.23) are compatible. This follows with the Ricci identity from

The basic equation (2.23) can be regarded as the generalization of the Galilean
law of inertia in the presence of a gravitational field. It is a great triumph that the
universality of the inertial/gravitational mass ratio is automatic. It is natural to regard
μ
the connection coefficients Γ αβ as the gravitational-inertial field strength relative to
the coordinates {x μ }.

In other words, the world lines of light rays are null geodesics. (See also Exercise 2.7.) Later (in Sect. 2.8) we shall derive these equations from Maxwell’s equations in the eikonal approximation.
At each spacetime point p ∈ M we can consider, as in Minkowski spacetime, the
past and future null cones in the tangent space Tp M. These are tangent to past and
future light cones, generated by light rays ending up in p, respectively emanating
from p. The set of all these light cones describes the causal structure of spacetime.
Relativists are used to draw spacetime diagrams. A typical example that illustrates some of the basic concepts we have introduced so far is shown in Fig. 2.4.

By a standard argument, the curly bracket must vanish. Renaming some indices
and using the symmetry of gμν , one finds that x μ (τ ) satisfies the geodesic equation
(2.23).

2.4.4 Energy and Momentum “Conservation” in the Presence of
an External Gravitational Field
According to the special theory of relativity, the energy-momentum tensor T μν of a
closed system satisfies, as a result of translation invariance, the conservation law
T μν,ν = 0.
In the presence of a gravitational field, we define a corresponding tensor field on
(M, g) such that it reduces to the special relativistic form at the origin of a locally
inertial system.

26

2

Physics in External Gravitational Fields

Example (Energy-momentum tensor for an ideal fluid) In SR the form of the
energy-momentum tensor is established as follows. A fluid is by definition ideal if a
comoving observer sees the fluid around him as isotropic. So let us consider a local
rest frame, that is an inertial system such that the fluid is at rest at some particular
spacetime point. Relative to this system (indicated by a tilde) the energy-momentum
tensor has at that point the form
T̃ 00 = ρ,

T̃ 0i = T̃ i0 = 0,

T̃ ij = pδij ,

(2.31)

where ρ is the proper energy density and p is the pressure of the fluid (c = 1). The
four-velocity uμ of the fluid has in the local rest frame the value ũ0 = 1, ũi = 0, and
hence we can write (2.31) as
T̃ μν = (ρ + p)ũμ ũν + pημν .
Since this is a tensor equation it holds in any inertial system.
In the presence of gravitational fields our general prescription leads uniquely to
T μν = (ρ + p)uμ uν + pg μν ,

(2.32)

gμν uμ uν = −1.

(2.33)

with the normalization

of the four-velocity field. For an introduction to special relativistic fluid dynamics,
see for instance [21].
Remark We shall discuss in Sect. 3.3.4 a general method of constructing the energymomentum tensor in the framework of the Lagrangian formalism.
μν

At the origin p ∈ M of a locally inertial system we have, by the EEP, T ,ν = 0
μν
at p. We may just as well write T ;ν = 0 at p, where the semicolon denotes the
covariant derivative of the tensor field. This equation is generally covariant, and
hence is valid in any coordinate system. We thus arrive at
T

μν
;ν = 0.

(2.34)

Conclusion From this consideration, we conclude quite generally that the physical
laws of special relativity are changed in the presence of a gravitational field simply
by the substitution of covariant derivatives for ordinary derivatives, often called the
principle of minimal coupling (or comma −→ semicolon rule). This is an expression
of the principle of equivalence. (Possible ambiguities for higher order derivatives are
discussed at the end of this section.)
In this manner the coupling of the gravitational field to physical systems is determined in an extremely simple manner.

Because of the second term in (2.36), this is no longer a conservation law. We cannot

since the system under consideration can exchange energy and momentum with the
gravitational field.

2.4.6 Electrodynamics
We assume that the reader is familiar with the four-dimensional tensor formulation
of electrodynamics in SR. The basic dynamical object is the antisymmetric electromagnetic field tensor Fμν , which unifies the electric and magnetic fields as follows:
⎞
⎛
0 −E1 −E2 −E3
⎜E1
0
B3 −B2 ⎟
⎟
(Fμν ) = ⎜
⎝E2 −B3
0
B1 ⎠
E3 B2 −B1
0
In the language of differential forms (DG, Chap. 14) Fμν can be regarded as the
components of the 2-form
1
F = Fμν dx μ ∧ dx ν
2


= E1 dx 1 + E2 dx 2 + E3 dx 3 ∧ dx 0
+ B1 dx 2 ∧ dx 3 + B2 dx 3 ∧ dx 1 + B3 dx 1 ∧ dx 2 ,

(2.41)

sometimes called the Faraday form. The homogeneous Maxwell equations are
∂λ Fμν + ∂μ Fνλ + ∂ν Fλμ = 0,

(2.42)

expressing that the Faraday 2-form is closed:
dF = 0.

(2.43)

Obviously, this law makes no use of a metric.
If j μ = (ρ, J ) denotes the current four-vector, the inhomogeneous Maxwell
equations are (c = 1),
∂ν F μν = 4πj μ .

(2.44)

With the calculus of differential forms this can be written as
δF = −4πJ,

(2.45)

2.4 Non-gravitational Laws in External Gravitational Fields

29

where δ is the codifferential7 and J denotes the current 1-form
J = jμ dx μ .

(2.46)

The generalization of these fundamental equations to Einstein’s gravity theory
is simple: We have to define Fμν and j μ such that they transform as tensor fields,
and have the same meaning as in SR in locally inertial systems. Secondly, we must
apply the ∂μ −→ ∇μ rule. Maxwell’s equations in GR are thus
∇λ Fμν + ∇μ Fνλ + ∇ν Fλμ = 0,
∇ν F μν = 4πj μ ,

(2.47a)
(2.47b)

with
F μν = g μα g νβ Fαβ .

(2.48)

Because of (2.43) the metric should drop out in (2.47a). The reader may verify
explicitly that the following identity
∇λ Fμν + · · · = ∂λ Fμν + · · ·
holds for any antisymmetric tensor field Fμν . A more general statement is derived
in DG, Sect. 15.4 (Eq. (15.25)).
As expected, the inhomogeneous equations (2.47b) imply (covariant) current
conservation
∇μ j μ = 0.

(2.49)

This follows from the identity ∇μ ∇ν F μν ≡ 0. A simple way to show this is to
note that for an antisymmetric tensor field F μν and a vector field j μ the following
identities hold (see Exercise 2.10)
√

1
∇ν F μν ≡ √ ∂ν −gF μν ,
−g

(2.50)

√

1
∇μ j μ ≡ √ ∂μ −gj μ .
−g

(2.51)

These can also be used to rewrite (2.47b) and (2.49) as
√

1
√ ∂ν −gF μν = 4πj μ ,
−g
√

∂μ −gj μ = 0.

(2.52)
(2.53)

In terms of differential forms, things are again much more concise. Due to the
identity δ ◦ δ = 0, Eq. (2.45) implies immediately δJ = 0, and this is equivalent to
7 Note the sign convention for δ adopted in DG, Sect. 14.6.4, which is not universally used.

(2.49) (see DG, Exercise 15.8). Because of Gauss’ Theorem (DG, Theorem 14.12),
the vanishing of the divergence of J implies an integral conservation law (conservation of electric charge).

The homogeneous Maxwell equation (2.43) allows us also in GR to introduce
vector potentials, at least locally. By Poincaré’s Lemma (DG, Sect. 14.4), F is locally exact
F = dA.

(2.56)

In components, with A = Aμ dx μ , we have
Fμν = ∂μ Aν − ∂ν Aμ

(≡ ∇μ Aν − ∇ν Aμ ).

(2.57)

Aμ −→ Aμ + ∂μ χ,

(2.58)

As in SR there is a gauge freedom
A −→ A + dχ

or

where χ is any smooth function. This can be used to impose gauge conditions, for
instance the Lorentz condition
∇μ Aμ = 0 (or δA = 0).

(2.59)

We stay in this class if χ in (2.58) is restricted to satisfy
χ := ∇μ ∇ μ χ = 0.

(2.60)

In terms of the four-potential Aμ we can write the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations (2.47b) as
∇ν ∇ ν Aμ − ∇ν ∇ μ Aν = −4πj μ .

(2.61)

Let us impose the Lorentz condition. We can use this in the second term with the
help of the Ricci identity for the commutator of two covariant derivatives (DG,
Eq. (15.92))
(∇μ ∇ν − ∇ν ∇μ )Aα = R αβμν Aβ .

(2.62)

2.4 Non-gravitational Laws in External Gravitational Fields

31

This leads to
∇ν ∇ ν Aμ − R μν Aν = −4πj μ .

(2.63)

Note that in SR (2.63) reduces to the inhomogeneous wave equation ∂ν ∂ ν Aμ =
−4πj μ . If we would substitute here covariant derivatives, we would miss the curvature term in (2.63). This example illustrates possible ambiguities in applying the
∂ −→ ∇ rule to second order differential equations, because covariant derivatives
do not commute. In passing, we mention that without the curvature term we would,
however, lose gauge invariance (see Exercise 2.11).
Let us finally derive a wave equation for F in vacuum (J = 0). With the calculus
of exterior forms this is extremely simple: From dF = 0 and δF = 0 we deduce
F = 0,

(2.64)

2.5 The Newtonian Limit
For any generalization of a successful physical theory it is crucial to guarantee that
the old theory is preserved within certain limits. The Newtonian theory should be an
excellent approximation for slowly varying weak gravitational fields and small velocities of material bodies. At this point we can check only part of this requirement,
because the dynamical equation for the metric field is not yet known to us.
We consider a test particle moving slowly in a quasi-stationary weak gravitational
field. For weak fields, there are coordinate systems which are nearly Lorentzian.
This means that
gμν = ημν + hμν ,

|hμν |  1.

(2.70)

For a slowly moving particle (in comparison with the speed of light) we have
dx 0 /dτ ≃ 1 and we neglect dx i /dτ (i = 1, 2, 3) in comparison to dx 0 /dτ in the
geodesic equation (2.23). We then obtain

Thus only the components Γ i00 appear in the equation of motion. To first order in

where φ is the Newtonian potential, if we set h00 ≃ −2φ + const. For an isolated
system φ and h00 should vanish at infinity. So we arrive at the important relation
g00 ≃ −1 − 2φ.

(2.75)

Note that we only obtain information on the component g00 for a Newtonian
situation. However, this does not mean that the other components of hμν must be
small in comparison to h00 . The almost Newtonian approximation of the other components will be determined in Sect. 5.2. (In this connection an interesting remark is
made in Exercise 2.18.) Table 2.1 shows that for most situations the correction in
(2.75) is indeed very small.
Remark In the Newtonian limit, the Poisson equation for φ will follow from Einstein’s field equation.

2.5.1 Exercises
Exercise 2.17 Use (2.75) to derive the Newtonian limit of the basic equation for an
ideal fluid.
Exercise 2.18 The result (2.75) might suggest that the metric for a Newtonian situation is approximately
g = −(1 + 2φ) dt 2 + dx 2 + dy 2 + dz2 .
Compute for this metric the deflection of light by the sun.

34

2

Physics in External Gravitational Fields

Remark It turns out that the deflection angle is only half 8 of the value of GR that
will be derived in Sect. 4.4. The reason for this famous factor 2 is that the correct
Newtonian approximation will be found to be


g = −(1 + 2φ) dt 2 + (1 − 2φ) dx 2 + dy 2 + dz2 .
(2.76)
Thus, the spatial part of the metric is non-Euclidean. This result will be derived in
Sect. 5.2.

2.6 The Redshift in a Stationary Gravitational Field
The derivation of the gravitational redshift in this section is a bit pedestrian, but
instructive. A more elegant treatment will be given in Sect. 2.9.
We consider a clock in an arbitrary gravitational field which moves along an arbitrary timelike world line (not necessarily in free fall). According to the principle
of equivalence, the clock rate is unaffected by the gravitational field when one observes it from a locally inertial system. Let Δt be the time between “ticks” of clocks
at rest in some inertial system in the absence of a gravitational field. In the locally
inertial system {ξ μ } under consideration, we then have for the coordinate intervals
dξ μ between two ticks

Δt = −ημν dξ μ dξ ν .
In an arbitrary coordinate system {x μ } we obviously have

Δt = −gμν dx μ dx ν .
Hence,



dx μ dx ν −1/2
dt
= −gμν
,
Δt
dt dt

(2.77)

where dt = dx 0 denotes the time interval between two ticks relative to the system
{x μ }. If the clock is at rest relative to this system, i.e. dx i /dt = 0, we have in particular
1
dt
=√
.
(2.78)
−g00
Δt
This is true for any clock. For this reason, we cannot verify (2.77) or (2.78) locally.
However, we can compare the time dilations at two different points with each other.
For this purpose, we specialize the discussion to the case of a stationary field. By this
we mean that we can choose the coordinates x μ such that the gμν are independent
of t. Now consider Fig. 2.5 with two clocks at rest at the points 1 and 2. (One can
convince oneself that the clocks are at rest in any other coordinate system in which
8 Einstein got this result in 1911 during his time in Prague. He obtained the correct value only after
he found his final vacuum equation in November 1915.

2.6 The Redshift in a Stationary Gravitational Field

the gμν are independent of time. The concept “at rest” has an intrinsic meaning for
stationary fields. See Sect. 2.9 for a geometrical discussion.)
Let a periodic wave be emitted at point 2. Since the field is stationary, the time
(relative to our chosen coordinate system) which a wave crest needs to move from
point 2 to point 1 is constant.9 The time between the arrival of successive crests (or
troughs) at point 1 is thus equal to the time dt2 between their emission at point 2,
which is, according to (2.78)
1
dt2 = Δt √
.
−g00 (x2 )
If on the other hand, we consider the same atomic transition at point 1, then, according to (2.78) the time dt1 between two wave crests, as observed at point 1 is
1
dt1 = Δt √
.
−g00 (x1 )
For a given atomic transition, the ratio of frequencies observed at point 1 for light
emitted at the points 2 and 1, respectively, is equal to

2.7 Fermat’s Principle for Static Gravitational Fields
In the following we shall study in more detail light rays in a static gravitational
field. A characteristic property of a static field is that in suitable coordinates the
metric splits as
ds 2 = g00 (x) dt 2 + gik (x) dx i dx k .

(2.81)

Thus there are no off-diagonal elements g0i and the gμν are independent of time.
We shall give an intrinsic definition of a static field in Sect. 2.9.
If λ is an affine parameter, the paths x μ (λ) of light rays can be characterized by
the variational principle (using standard notation)

Now consider a general variation of the path x μ (λ), for which only the spatial endpoints x i (λ) are held fixed, while the condition δt = 0 at the endpoints is
dropped. If we require that the varied paths also satisfy the normalization condition

The time lapse on the right is a functional of the spatial path. If the varied orbit is
also traversed at the speed of light (just as the original path), the left-hand side of
(2.86) is equal to zero and for the varied light-like curves the relation
√
−g00 dt = dσ
(2.87)
holds, where dσ 2 = gik dx i dx k is the 3-dimensional Riemannian metric of the spatial sections. We thus have

This is Fermat’s principle of least time. The second equality in (2.88) determines
the spatial path of the light ray. Note that the spatial path integral is parametrization
invariant. The time has been completely eliminated in this formulation: The second
equation in (2.88) is valid for an arbitrary portion of the spatial path of the light
ray, for any variation such that the ends are held fixed. A comparison with Fermat’s
principle in optics shows that the role of the index of refraction has been taken over
by (g00 )−1/2 .
With this classical argument, that goes back to Weyl and Levi-Civita, we have
arrived at the interesting result that the path of a light ray is a geodesic in the spatial
sections for what is often called the Fermat metric
F
gF = gik
dx i dx k ,

(2.89)

F = g /(−g ). We thus have the variational principle for the spatial path
where gik

(2.90)

where the spatial endpoints are kept fixed. Instead of the energy functional for gF
we can, of course, also use the length functional. This result is useful for calculating
the propagation of light rays in gravitational fields. In many situations it suffices to
use the almost Newtonian approximation (2.76) for the metric. The Fermat metric
is then
1 − 2φ 2
gF =
(2.91)

1 + 2φ
with dx 2 = (dx 1 )2 + (dx 2 )2 + (dx 3 )2 . Fermat’s principle becomes

where |ẋ| denotes the Euclidean norm of dx/dλ. This agrees with the Fermat principle of geometrical optics

This can be used as the starting point for much of gravitational lensing theory, an
important branch of present day astronomy. Section 5.8 will be devoted to this topic.
Exercise 2.19 Consider a stationary source-free electromagnetic field Fμν in a
static gravitational field g with metric (2.81). Show that the time independent scalar
potential ϕ satisfies the Laplace equation

where Δ(gF ) is the 3-dimensional Laplace operator for the Fermat metric gF .
Hints Use the conformal invariance of Maxwell’s equations and work with the metric g/g00 .

2.8 Geometric Optics in Gravitational Fields
In most instances gravitational fields vary even over macroscopic distances so little
that the propagation of light and radio waves can be described in the geometric optics limit (ray optics). We shall derive in this section the laws of geometric optics
in the presence of gravitational fields from Maxwell’s equations (see also the corresponding discussion in books on optics). In addition to the geodesic equation for
light rays, we shall find a simple propagation law for the polarization vector.
The following characteristic lengths are important for our analysis:
1. The wavelength λ.
2. A typical length L over which the amplitude, polarization and wavelength of the
wave vary significantly (for example the radius of curvature of a wave front).
3. A typical “radius of curvature” for the geometry; more precisely, take
R=

typical component of the Riemannian tensor
in a typical local inertial system

The region of validity for geometric optics is

2.8 Geometric Optics in Gravitational Fields

Consider a wave which is highly monochromatic in regions having a size smaller
than L (more general cases can be treated via Fourier analysis). Now separate the
four-vector potential Aμ into a rapidly varying real phase ψ and a slowly varying
complex amplitude Aμ (eikonal ansatz)


Aμ = Re Aμ eiψ .
It is convenient to introduce the small parameter ε = λ/ min(L, R). We may expand
Aμ = aμ + εbμ + · · · , where aμ , bμ , . . . are independent of λ. Since ψ ∝ λ−1 , we
replace ψ by ψ/ε. We thus seek solutions of the form


Aμ = Re (aμ + εbμ + · · · )eiψ/ε .
(2.95)

In the following let kμ = ∂μ ψ be the wave number, a = (aμ ā μ ) the scalar amplitude and fμ = aμ /a the polarization vector, where fμ is a complex unit vector.
By definition, light rays are integral curves of the vector field k μ and are thus perpendicular to the surfaces of constant phase ψ , in other words perpendicular to the
wave fronts.
Now insert the geometric-optics ansatz (2.95) into Maxwell’s equations. In vacuum, these are given (see Sect. 2.4.6)

As a consequence of these equations, we obtain the geodesic law for the propagation

Now kν = ψ,ν and since ψ;ν;μ = ψ;μ;ν we obtain, after interchanging indices,
k ν kμ;ν = 0,

(∇k k = 0).

(2.106)

We have thus demonstrated that, as a consequence of Maxwell’s equations, the paths
of light rays are null geodesics.

(2.108)

We thus see that the polarization vector f μ is perpendicular to the light rays and is
parallel-propagated along them.
Remark The gauge condition (2.101) is consistent with the other equations: Since
the vectors k μ and f μ are parallel transported along the rays, one must specify the
condition kμ f μ = 0 at only one point. For the same reason, the equations fμ f¯μ = 1
and kμ k μ = 0 are preserved.
Equation (2.107) can be rewritten as follows. After multiplying by a, we have
 ν  2
k ∇ν a + a 2 ∇ν k ν = 0
or

 2 μ
a k ;μ = 0,

(2.109)

thus a 2 k μ is a conserved “current”.
Quantum mechanically this has the meaning of a conservation law for the number of photons. Of course, the photon number is not in general conserved; it is an
adiabatic invariant, in other words, a quantity which varies very slowly for R  λ,
in comparison to the photon frequency.
Let us consider the eikonal equation (2.104) for the almost Newtonian metric
(2.76)
−(1 − 2φ)(∂t ψ)2 + (1 + 2φ)(∇ψ)2 = 0.
Since φ is time independent we set
ψ(x, t) = S(x) − ωt

(2.110)

and obtain (up to higher orders in φ)
(∇S)2 = n2 ω2 ,

n = 1 − 2φ.

(2.111)

This has the standard form of the eikonal equation in ray optics with refraction
index n. The connection between n and the Newtonian potential φ was already
found earlier with the help of Fermat’s principle.

2.9 Stationary and Static Spacetimes
For this section the reader should be familiar with parts of DG covered in Chaps. 12
and 13.
In Sect. 2.5 we defined somewhat naively a gravitational field to be stationary if
there exist coordinates {x μ } for which the components gμν of the metric tensor are
independent of t = x 0 . We translate this definition into an intrinsic property of the
μ
spacetime (M, g). Let K = ∂/∂x 0 , i.e., K μ = δ 0 . The Lie derivative LK g of the
metric tensor is then
(LK g)μν = K λ gμν,λ + gλν K λ,μ + gμλ K λ,ν
= 0 + 0 + 0,

(2.112)

so that
LK g = 0.

(2.113)

A vector field K which satisfies (2.113) is a Killing field or an infinitesimal isometry.
This leads us to the
Definition 2.1 A spacetime (M, g) is stationary if there exists a timelike Killing
field K.
This means that observers moving with the flow of the Killing field K recognize
no changes (see DG, Theorem 13.11). It may be, as in the case for black holes, that
a Killing field is only timelike in some open region of M. We then say that this part
of spacetime is stationary.

2.9 Stationary and Static Spacetimes

43

Fig. 2.6 Adapted
(stationary) coordinates

Let us conversely show that Definition 2.1 implies the existence of local coordinates for which the gμν are independent of time. Choose a spacelike hypersurface
S of M and consider the integral curves of K passing through S (see Fig. 2.6). In
S we choose arbitrary coordinates and introduce local coordinates of M as follows:
If p = φt (p0 ), where p0 ∈ S and φt is the flow of K, then the (Lagrange-) coordinates of p are (t, x 1 (p0 ), x 2 (p0 ), x 3 (p0 )). In terms of these coordinates, we have
K = ∂/∂x 0 , and LK g = 0 implies (using (2.112))
gμν,0 + 0 + 0 = 0.
We call such coordinates to be adapted to the Killing field.
Static fields are special cases of stationary fields. The following heuristic consideration will lead us to their proper definition. We choose adapted coordinates
and assume that g0i = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3. Then the Killing field is orthogonal to
the spatial sections {t = const.}. The 1-form ω corresponding to K (ω = K  ,
ωμ = Kμ = gμν K ν ) is then
ω = g00 dt = K, K dt.

(2.114)

This implies trivially the Frobenius condition
ω ∧ dω = 0.

(2.115)

Conversely, let us assume that the Frobenius condition holds for a stationary
spacetime with Killing field K. We apply the interior product iK to (2.115) and use
Cartan’s formula LK = d ◦ iK + iK ◦ d:
0 = iK (ω ∧ dω) =

and the right-hand sides of both equations agree.
Using the abbreviation V := K, K = 0 we thus arrive at
V dω + ω ∧ dV = 0 or

d(ω/V ) = 0.

(2.116)

Together with the Poincaré Lemma we see that locally ω = V df for a function f .
We use this function as our time coordinate t,
ω = K, K dt.

(2.117)

K is perpendicular to the spacelike sections {t = const.}. Indeed, for a tangential vector field X to such a section, K, X = ω(X) = V dt (X) = V (Xt) = 0. In
adapted coordinates we have therefore K = ∂t and g0i = ∂t , ∂i  = K, ∂i  = 0.
Summarizing, if the Frobenius condition (2.115) for the timelike Killing field is
satisfied, the metric splits locally as
g = g00 (x) dt 2 + gik (x) dx i dx k ,

(2.118)

g00 = K, K,

(2.119)

and
where K = ∂/∂t. This leads us to the
Definition 2.2 A stationary spacetime (M, g) with timelike Killing field is static, if
ω = K  satisfies the Frobenius condition ω ∧dω = 0, whence locally ω = K, K dt
for an adapted time coordinate t, which is unique up to an additive constant.
The flow of K maps the hypersurfaces {t = const.} isometrically onto each other.
An observer at rest moves along integral curves of K.

2.9.1 Killing Equation
According to DG, Eq. (15.104) we have for any vector field X and its associated
1-form α = X  the identity
1
∇α = (LX g − dα).
2

(2.120)

For the special case X = K and α = ω this gives
1
∇ω = − dω.
2

(2.121)

In components, this is equivalent to the Killing equation
Kμ;ν + Kν;μ = 0.

(2.122)

2.9 Stationary and Static Spacetimes

45

A shorter derivation in terms of local coordinates goes as follows. From (2.112)
we obtain for a Killing field
K λ gμν,λ + gλν K λ,μ + gμλ K λ,ν = 0.
Now introduce, for a given point p, normal coordinates with origin p. At this point
the last equation reduces to Kμ,ν + Kν,μ = 0 or, equivalently, to (2.122). But (2.122)
is generally invariant and so holds in any coordinate system.
The reader may wonder, how one might obtain (2.116) in terms of local coordinates. We want to demonstrate that such a derivation can be faster. We write the
Frobenius condition (2.115) in components
Kμ Kν,λ + Kν Kλ,μ + Kλ Kμ,ν = 0.
The left hand side does not change if partial derivatives are replaced by covariant
derivatives. If then multiply the resulting equation by K λ and use the Killing equation (2.122), we obtain




−Kμ K λ Kλ ;ν + Kν K λ Kλ ;μ + K λ Kλ (Kμ;ν − Kν;μ ) = 0.
This implies
Kν /K, K ,μ − Kμ /K, K ,ν = 0,
and this is equivalent to (2.116).

2.9.2 The Redshift Revisited
The discussion of the gravitational redshift in Sect. 2.6 was mathematically a bit
ugly. Below we give two derivations which are more satisfactory, mathematically.

First Derivation
In the eikonal approximation (see Sect. 2.8) we have for the electromagnetic field
tensor


Fμν = Re fμν eiψ ,
where fμν is a slowly varying amplitude. Light rays are integral curves of the vector
field k μ = ψ ,μ and are null geodesics (see Sect. 2.8). Since k μ ψ,μ = 0, the light rays
propagate along surfaces of constant phase, i.e. wave fronts.
Consider now the world lines, parameterized by proper time, of a transmitter and
an observer, as well as two light rays which connect the two (see Fig. 2.7). Let the
corresponding phases be ψ = ψ0 and ψ = ψ0 + Δψ. We denote the interval of
proper time between the events at which the two light rays intersect the world line i

(2.123) gives

ν2 Δτ1 k, u2 

(2.124)

This equation gives the combined effects of Doppler and gravitational redshifts (and
is also useful in SR).
Now, we specialize (2.124) to a stationary spacetime with Killing field K. For
an observer at rest (along an integral curve of K) with four-velocity u, we have

1/2
K = −K, K
u.

(2.125)

Furthermore, we note that k, K is constant along a light ray, since
∇k k, K = ∇k k, K + k, ∇k K = 0.
Note that the last term is equal to k α k β Kα;β and vanishes as a result of the Killing
equation; alternatively, due to (2.121) it is proportional to dω(k, k) = 0.
If both emitter and observer are at rest, we obtain from (2.124) and (2.125)

Remark At first sight this appears to be inconsistent with (2.79). However, the frequencies are defined there differently. In Sect. 2.6, ν1 and ν2 are both measured at
1, but ν2 refers to a definite atomic transition at 2, while ν1 is the frequency of the
same transition of an atom at the observer’s position 1. In (2.127) the meaning of ν1
and ν2 is different: ν1 and ν2 are the frequencies assigned to the light by 1 and 2,
respectively.
Second Derivation
We again work in the limit of geometric optics, and consider the same situation as
before. Emitter and observer, with four-velocities u1 and u2 , can be connected to
each other by null geodesics with tangent vectors k (see Fig. 2.8). We assume that
for a finite τ1 -interval, null geodesics exist which are received by the observer. This
family of null geodesics can be parameterized by the emission time τ1 or by the
observer time τ2 , and defines a function τ2 (τ1 ). The frequency ratio r is clearly the
derivative of this function,
r=

dτ2
.
dτ1

(2.128)

We can parameterize the null geodesics by an affine parameters s, such that s = 0
along the world line 1 and s = 1 along 2. In what follows we parameterize the 1parameter family of null geodesics by (s, τ1 ) −→ H (s, τ1 ). With this set up, we are
in a situation that has been studied generally in DG, Sect. 16.4. We use the concepts
and results which have been developed there (including Sect. 16.2 and Sect. 16.3).
k is a tangential vector field along the map H

Note that
V |s=0 = u1 ,

V |s=1 = ru2 ,

(2.131)

because τ1 −→ H (s = 1, τ1 ) is the world line 2, parameterized by τ1 .
We shall show below that V , k is constant along a null geodesic. Using this, the
ratio r can easily be computed. We obtain the previous result (2.124) from
V , k1 1 = u1 , k = V , k2 = ru2 , k.
The rest is as before.
It remains to prove that V , k is constant. The null geodesics satisfy
k, k = 0,

∇k k = 0.

(2.132)

(We denote the Levi-Civita connection and the induced covariant derivatives for
vector fields along the map H by the same letter.) For the tangential vector fields
along H , such as k and V , we have (DG, Proposition 16.4 and 16.5)
∇A B − ∇B A = [A, B],

(2.133)

A X, Y  = ∇A X, Y  + X, ∇A Y 

(2.134)

where A, B ∈ X (H )T and

for A = T H ◦ A and X, Y ∈ X (H ). Using this we get (for A = ∂/∂s)

2.10 Spin Precession and Fermi Transport
Suppose that an observer moves along a timelike world line in a gravitational field
(not necessarily in free fall). One might, for example, consider an astronaut in a
space capsule. For practical reasons he will choose a coordinate system in which
all apparatus attached to his capsule is at rest. What is the equation of motion of a
freely falling test body in this coordinate system? More specifically, the following
questions arise:
1. How should the observer orient his space ship so that “Coriolis forces” do not
appear?

2.10

Spin Precession and Fermi Transport

49

2. How does one describe the motion of a gyroscope? One might expect that it will
not rotate relative to the frame of references, provided the latter is chosen such
that Coriolis forces are absent.
3. It is possible to find a spatial frame of reference for an observer at rest in a stationary field, which one might call Copernican? What is the equation of motion
of a spinning top in such a frame of reference? Under what conditions will it not
rotate relative to the Copernican frame?

2.10.1 Spin Precession in a Gravitational Field
By spin we mean either the polarization vector of a particle (i.e., the expectation
value of the spin operator for a particle in a particular quantum mechanical state) or
the intrinsic angular momentum of a rigid body, such as a gyroscope.
In both cases this is initially defined only relative to a local inertial system in
which the body is at rest (its local rest system). In this system the spin is described
by a three vector S. For a gyroscope or for an elementary particle, the equivalence
principle implies that in the local rest system, in the absence of external forces,
d
S(t) = 0.
dt

(2.135)

(We assume that the interaction of the gyroscope’s quadrupole moment with inhomogeneities of the gravitational field can be neglected; this effect is studied in Exercise 2.23 at the end of this section.) We now define a four-vector S which reduces
to (0, S) in the local rest system. This last requirement can be expressed invariantly
as
S, u = 0,

(2.136)

where u is the four-velocity.
We shall now rewrite (2.135) in a covariant form. For this we consider ∇u S. In
the local rest system (indicated by R) we have
  0 
 0
dS

(2.137)

It follows from Eq. (2.136) that
∇u S, u = −S, ∇u u = −S, a,

(2.138)

where a = ∇u u is the acceleration. Hence,
∇u S, u = −

dS 0

From (2.137) and (2.139) we then have

(∇u S)R = S, a, 0 = S, au R .

(2.139)

(2.140)

50

The desired covariant equation is thus
∇u S = S, au.

(2.141)

Equation (2.136) is consistent with (2.141). Indeed from (2.141) we find
u, ∇u S = S, au, u = −S, a = −S, ∇u u,
so that ∇u u, S = 0.

2.10.2 Thomas Precession
For Minkowski spacetime (2.141) reduces to
Ṡ = S, u̇u,

(2.142)

where the dot means differentiation with respect to proper time. One can easily
derive the Thomas precession from this equation.
Let x(τ ) denote the path of a particle. The instantaneous rest system (at time τ )
is obtained form the laboratory system via the special Lorentz transformation Λ(β),
where β = v/c and v the 3-velocity. With respect to this family of instantaneous rest
systems S has the form S = (0, S(t)), where t is the time in the laboratory frame.
We obtain the equation of motion for S(t) easily from (2.142). Since S is a four
vector, we have, in the laboratory frame, with standard notation of SR


(2.143)
S = γ β · S, S + β

In addition,

After some rearrangements, one finds
Ṡ = S × ωT ,

(2.146)

where ωT = γβ−1
2 β × β̇. This is the well-known expression of the Thomas precession.

2.10.3 Fermi Transport
Definition Let γ (s), with s the proper time, be a timelike curve with tangent vector
u = γ̇ satisfying u, u = −1. The Fermi derivative F u of a vector field X along γ
is defined by
F u X = ∇u X − X, au + X, ua,

(2.147)

where a = ∇u u.
Since S, u = 0 we may write (2.141) in the form
F u S = 0.

(2.148)

It is easy to show that the Fermi derivative (2.147) has the following important
properties:
1. F u = ∇u if γ is a geodesic;
2. F u u = 0;
3. If F u X = F u Y = 0 for vector fields X, Y along γ , then X, Y  is constant along
γ;
4. If X, u = 0 along γ , then
F u X = (∇u X)⊥ .

(2.149)

Here ⊥ denotes the projection perpendicular to u.
These properties show that the Fermi derivative is a natural generalization of ∇u .
We say that a vector field X is Fermi transported along γ if F γ̇ X = 0. Since this
equation is linear in X, Fermi transport defines (analogously to parallel transport) a
two parameter family of isomorphisms
F
τt,s
: Tγ (s) (M) −→ Tγ (t) (M).

One can show that



F γ̇ X γ (t) =
τ F X γ (s) .
ds s=t t,s
The proof is similar to that of Theorem 15.1 in DG.

52

Physics in External Gravitational Fields

As in the case of the covariant derivative (see DG, Sect. 15.4), the Fermi derivative can be extended to arbitrary tensor fields such that the following properties
hold:
1. F u transforms a tensor field of type (r, s) into another tensor field of the same
type;
2. F u commutes with contractions;
3. F u (S ⊗ T ) = (F u S) ⊗ T + S ⊗ (F u T );
4. F u f = df/ds, when f is a function;
F induces linear isomorphisms
5. τt,s
Tγ (s) (M)rs −→ Tγ (t) (M)rs .
We now consider the world line γ (τ ) of an accelerated observer (τ is the proper
time). Let u = γ̇ and let {ei }, with i = 1, 2, 3, be an arbitrary orthonormal frame
along γ perpendicular to e0 := γ̇ = u. We then have
eμ , eν  = ημν ,
where (ημν ) = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1). For the acceleration a := ∇u u it follows from
u, u = −1 that a, u = 0. We set
ωij = ∇u ei , ej  = −ωj i .

equal to −u, ua + u, au = a = ∇u u. Using (2.147) this can be written in the
form
F u eα = ωαβ eβ .

ωα thus describes the deviation from Fermi transport. For a spinning top we have
F u S = 0 and S, u = 0. If we write S = S i ei , then

hence,

Thus the top precesses relative to the frame {ei } with angular velocity Ω, where
ωij = εij k Ω k .

(2.154)

We may write (2.153) in three-dimensional vector notation
dS
= S × Ω.
dτ

(2.155)

If the frame {ei } is Fermi transported along γ , then clearly Ω = 0. We shall evaluate
(2.150) for the angular velocity in a number of instances. A first example is given in
Sect. 2.10.5.

2.10.4 The Physical Difference Between Static and Stationary
Fields
We consider now an observer at rest in a stationary spacetime with timelike Killing
field K. The observer thus moves along an integral curve γ (τ ) of K. His fourvelocity u is

−1/2
u = −K, K
K.
(2.156)
We now choose an orthonormal triad {ei } along γ which is Lie-transported
LK ei = 0,

(2.157)

for i = 1, 2, 3. Note that the ei remain perpendicular to K and hence to u. Indeed, it
follows from
0 = LK g(X, Y ) = KX, Y  − LK X, Y  − X, LK Y 
that the orthogonality of the vector fields X and Y is preserved when LK X =
LK Y = 0. Also note that K itself is Lie-transported: LK K = [K, K] = 0.
The {ei } can then be interpreted as “axes at rest” and define what one may call
a “Copernican system” (see Fig. 2.9). We are interested in the change of the spin
relative to this system. Our starting point is (2.150) or, making use of (2.156)

Now
0 = T (K, ei ) = ∇K ei − ∇ei K − [K, ei ],
and [K, ei ] = LK ei = 0. Hence (2.158) implies

−1/2

−1/2
ej , ∇ei K = −K, K


−1/2 1 

∇K(ei , ej ) − ∇K(ej , ei )
ωij = − −K, K

or, since any one-form ϕ satisfies ∇ϕ(X, Y ) − ∇ϕ(Y, X) = −dϕ(X, Y ), we have
also
−1/2
1
ωij = −K, K
dK(ei , ej ).
(2.159)
2
We shall show below that
ωij = 0,

if and only if

K ∧ dK = 0.

(2.160)

From this it follows that a Copernican system does not rotate if and only if the
stationary field is static.
The one-form ∗(K ∧dK) can be regarded as a measure of the “absolute” rotation,
because the vector Ω = Ω k ek can be expressed in the form
1
Ω = − K, K−1 ∗ (K ∧ dK),
2

(2.161)

where Ω denotes the one-form corresponding to Ω.
It remains to derive Eq. (2.161). Let {θ μ } denote the dual basis of {eμ }, e0 = u.
From well-known properties of the ∗-operation (see DG, Sect. 14.6.2), we have


θ μ ∧ (K ∧ dK) = η θ μ , ∗(K ∧ dK) .
(2.162)
Since K = −(−K, K)1/2 θ 0 , the left hand side of (2.162) is equal to −(−K,
K)1/2 θ μ ∧ θ 0 ∧ dK and vanishes for μ = 0. From (2.159) we conclude that

1/2
ωij θ i ∧ θ j + terms containing θ 0 .
dK = −K, K

2.10

Hence we have
θ μ ∧ (K ∧ dK) =

0
K, Kεij l Ω l θ k ∧ θ 0 ∧ θ i ∧ θ j = −2K, KηΩ k

if μ = 0,
if μ = k,

where we used θ k ∧ θ 0 ∧ θ i ∧ θ j = −εij k η. From this and (2.162) we get
 μ

0
θ , ∗(K ∧ dK) =
−2K, KΩ k

if μ = 0,
if μ = k.

The left-hand side of this expression is equal to the contravariant components of
∗(K ∧ dK) and hence (2.161) follows. Obviously (2.161) implies (2.160).

2.10.5 Spin Rotation in a Stationary Field
The spin rotation relative to the Copernican system is given by (2.161). We now
write this in terms of adapted coordinates, with K = ∂/∂t and gμν independent of
t = x 0 . Then
K = g00 dt + g0i dx i ,
dK = g00,k dx k ∧ dt + g0i,k dx k ∧ dx i ,
K ∧ dK = (g00 g0i,j − g0i g00,j ) dt ∧ dx j ∧ dx i + g0k g0i,j dx k ∧ dx j ∧ dx i .

1
Ω ≃ − ∇ × g,
2

(2.166)

where g := (g01 , g02 , g03 ).
We have shown that in a stationary (but not static) field, a gyroscope rotates
relative to the Copernican system (relative to the “fixed stars”) with angular velocity
(2.164). In a weak field this can be approximated by (2.166). This means that the
rotation of a star drags along the local inertial system (Lense–Thirring effect). We
shall discuss possible experimental tests of this effect later.

2.10.6 Adapted Coordinate Systems for Accelerated Observers
We again consider the world line γ (τ ) of an (accelerated) observer. Let u = γ̇ and
let {ei } be an arbitrary orthonormal frame along γ which is perpendicular to e0 = u.
As before, a = ∇u u. Now construct a local coordinate system as follows: at every
point on γ (τ ) consider spacelike geodesics α(s) perpendicular to u, with proper
length s as affine parameter. Thus α(0) = γ (τ ); let n = α̇(0)⊥u. In order to distinguish the various geodesics, we denote the geodesic through γ (τ ) in the direction n
with affine parameter s by α(s, n, τ ) (see Fig. 2.10). We have
 
∂
n=
, n, n = 1.
(2.167)
∂s α(0,n,τ )

2.10

Spin Precession and Fermi Transport

57

Each point p ∈ M in the vicinity of the observer’s world line lies on precisely
one of these geodesics. If p = α(s, n, τ ) and n = nj ej we assign the following
coordinates to p
 0

 
x (p), . . . , x 3 (p) = τ, sn1 , sn2 , sn3 .
(2.168)
This means


x 0 α(s, n, τ ) = τ


x j α(s, n, τ ) = snj = snj = sn, ej .

(2.169)

Calculation of the Christoffel Symbols Along γ (τ )
Along the observer’s world line, we have by construction
∂
= eα ,
∂x α γ

(2.170)

and hence gαβ = ∂α , ∂β  = ηαβ along γ (τ ). If Γ αβγ denote the Christoffel symbols
β

relative to the tetrad {eα } (see DG, Sect. 15.7), then ∇u eα = ∇e0 eα = Γ 0α eβ and
thus
γ

eβ , ∇u eα  = ηβγ Γ 0α .

(2.171)

In particular,
Γ 000 = −u, ∇u u = 0,
j

Γ 00 = ej , ∇u u = ej , a = a j ,
Γ 00j = −u, ∇u ej  = ej , a = a j .
If we make use of ωij = ∇u ei , ej  = −ωj i , introduced in (2.150), and the angular
velocity Ω i ,
ωj k = εij k Ω i ,

(2.172)

j

(2.173)

then
Γ 0k = −εij k Ω i .

The remaining Christoffel symbols can be read off from the equation for the
geodesics s −→ α(s, n, τ ). According to (2.169) the coordinates x μ for these
geodesics are x 0 (s) = const. and x j (s) = snj , hence d 2 x α /ds 2 = 0. On the other
hand, the geodesics satisfy the equation
0=

Hence, along the observer’s world line γ we have
Γ αj k = 0.

(2.174)

The partial derivatives of the metric coefficients can be determined from the
Christoffel symbols. The general relation is
μ

0 = gαβ;γ = gαβ,γ − Γ μαγ gμβ − Γ βγ gαμ .
If we substitute gαβ = ηαβ along γ (τ ) and our previously derived results for the
Christoffel symbols, we find
gαβ,0 = 0,

gik,l = 0,

g00,j = −2a j ,

g0j,k = −εj kl Ω l .

These relations, together with gαβ = ηαβ along γ (τ ), imply that the metric near γ
is given by

2
g = −(1 + 2a · x) dx 0 − 2εj kl x k Ω l dx 0 dx j


+ δj k dx j dx k + O |x|2 dx α dx β .

(2.175)

From this we see that
1. The acceleration leads to the additional term
δg00 = −2a · x.

(2.176)

2. Since the observer’s coordinates axes rotate (Ω i = 0), the metric has the “nondiagonal” term
g0j = −εj kl x k Ω l = −(x × Ω)j .

(2.177)

3. The lowest order corrections are not affected by the curvature. The curvature
shows itself in second order.
4. If a = ∇u u = 0 and Ω = 0 (no acceleration and no rotation) we have a local
inertial system along γ (τ ).

2.10.7 Motion of a Test Body

example), observes a nearby freely falling body. This obeys the equation of motion

f j := R 00k x k .

are well-known from classical mechanics. The force R 00k x k is a consequence of the
inhomogeneity of the gravitational field.
If the frame {ei } is Fermi transported (Ω = 0), the Coriolis force (third term)
vanishes. If the observer is freely falling, then also a = 0 and only the tidal force
f j remains. This cannot be transformed away. The equation of motion for the test
body then becomes

General relativistic extensions of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) play an important
role in relativistic astrophysics, for instance in accretion processes on black holes.
In this section we present the basic equations in the limit of infinite conductivity
(ideal MHD).
We consider a relativistic fluid with rest-mass density ρ0 , energy-mass density ρ,
4-velocity uμ , and isotropic pressure p. The basic equations of ideal MHD are easy
to write down. First, we have the baryon conservation

(2.191)
∇μ ρ0 uμ = 0.
For a magnetized plasma the equations of motion are
∇ν T μν = 0,

We adopt the ideal MHD approximation
iu F = 0,

(2.196)

which expresses that the electric field vanishes in the rest frame of the fluid (infinite

Einstein’s Field Equations

There is something else that I have learned from the theory of gravitation: No collection of
empirical facts, however comprehensive, can ever lead to the setting up of such complicated
equations. A theory can be tested by experience, but there is no way from experience to the
formulation of a theory. Equations of such complexity as are the equations of the gravitational field can be found only through the discovery of a logically simple mathematical
condition which determines the equations completely or (at least) almost completely. Once
one has those sufficiently strong formal conditions, one requires only little knowledge of
facts for the setting up of a theory; in the case of the equations of gravitation it is the fourdimensionality and the symmetric tensor as expression for the structure of space which,
together with the invariance concerning the continuous transformation-group, determine
the equation almost completely.
—A. Einstein
(Autobiographical Notes, 1949)

In the previous chapter we examined the kinematical framework of the general
theory of relativity and the effect of gravitational fields on physical systems. The
hard core of the theory, however, consists of Einstein’s field equations, which relate
the metric field to matter. After a discussion of the physical meaning of the curvature
tensor, we shall first give a simple physical motivation for the field equations and
will then show that they are determined by only a few natural requirements.1

3.1 Physical Meaning of the Curvature Tensor
In a local inertial system the “field strengths” of the gravitational field (the Christoffel symbols) can be transformed away. Due to its tensor character, this is not possible
for the curvature. Physically, the curvature describes the “tidal forces” as we shall
see in the following. This was indicated already in the discussion of (2.181).
1 For an excellent historical account of Einstein’s struggle which culminated in the final form of his
gravitational field equations, presented on November 25 (1915), we refer to A. Pais, [71]. Since
the publication of this master piece new documents have been discovered, which clarified what
happened during the crucial weeks in November 1915 (see, e.g., [72]).

Einstein’s Field Equations

Fig. 3.1 Geodesic congruence

Consider a family of timelike geodesics, having the property that in a sufficiently
small open region of the Lorentz manifold (M, g) precisely one geodesic passes
through every point. Such a collection is called a congruence of timelike geodesics.
It might represent dust or a swarm of freely falling bodies. The tangent field to this
set of curves, with proper time s as curve parameter, is denoted by u. Note that
u, u = −1.
Let γ (t) be some curve transversal to the congruence. This means that the tangent
vector γ̇ is never parallel to u in the region under consideration, as indicated in
Fig. 3.1. Imagine that every point on the curve γ (t) moves a distance s along the
geodesics which passes through that point. Let the resulting point be H (s, t). This
defines a map H : Q −→ M from some open region Q of R2 into M. For each t, the
curve s −→ H (s, t) is a timelike geodesic with tangent vectors u(H (s, t)). Such 1parameter variations of geodesics are studied in DG, Sect. 16.4, using general results
developed in Sects. 16.2 and 16.3. With the concept introduced there, we can say
that u defines a vector field u ◦ H along the map H which is tangential, i.e. of the
form (16.8)
u◦H =TH ◦

∂
∂s



∂
or u H (s, t) = T(s,t) H · .
∂s

(3.1)

(In other words, u and ∂/∂s are H -related.) We shall use for u ◦ H the same letter u.
Let v be the tangential vector field along the map H belonging to ∂/∂t
v =TH ◦

∂
.
∂t

(3.2)

The vectors v(s, t) are tangent to the curves t −→ H (s, t) (s fixed), and represent
the separation of points which are moved with the same proper time along the neighboring geodesics of the congruence (beginning at arbitrary starting points).

3.1 Physical Meaning of the Curvature Tensor

67

Since ∂/∂s and ∂/∂t commute, the tangential fields u and v also commute, i.e.,
[u, v] = 0, which is equivalent to the statement that v is invariant under the flow of
the four-velocity field u; we also say that v is Lie-transported.2
If one adds a multiple of u to v, the resulting vector represents the separation
of points on the same two neighboring curves, but at different distances along the
curve. However, we are interested only in the distance between the curves and not
in the distance between particular points on these curves. This is represented by the
projection of v on the subspace of the tangent space which is perpendicular to u.
Thus the relevant (infinitesimal) separation vector n is
n = v + v, uu.

(3.3)

Since u, u = −1, n is indeed perpendicular to u. We now show that n is also
Lie-transported. We have


Lu n = [u, n] = [u, v] + u, v, uu = uv, u u,
uv, u =

∂
v, u.
∂s

Now, the Ricci identity and u, u = −1 imply3
0=

∂
u, u = 2∇v u, u.
∂t

Furthermore, since ∇v u = ∇u v (because u and v commute and the torsion vanishes),
it follows that
∂
u, v = ∇u u, v + u, ∇u v = u, ∇v u = 0.
∂s

(3.4)

This shows that indeed
Lu n = 0.

(3.5)

Next, we consider
∇u2 v = ∇u ∇u v = ∇u (∇v u) = (∇u ∇v − ∇v ∇u )u.
Due to [u, v] = 0, we obtain
∇u2 v = R(u, v)u.

(3.6)

This is called the Jacobi equation for the field v; see also DG, Sect. 16.4.
2 The reader is invited to generalize the proof of Theorem 13.11 (given in DG, Sect. 16.1) to vector

fields along maps.
3 To simplify notation, we use for the induced covariant derivative of fields along the map H the

same letter ∇ (instead of ∇˜ in the quoted sections of DG).

68

Einstein’s Field Equations

We now show that n also satisfies this equation. From (3.4) it follows that


∇u n = ∇u v + uv, u u + v, u∇u u = ∇u v.
(3.7)
Furthermore,
R(u, n)u = R(u, v)u + v, uR(u, u)u = R(u, v)u.

(3.8)

From (3.6), (3.7) and (3.8) we see that n satisfies the Jacobi equation
∇u2 n = R(u, n)u.

(3.9)

The Jacobi field n is everywhere perpendicular to u. Physicists usually call this the
equation for geodesic deviation. For a given u the right hand side defines at each
point p ∈ M a linear map n −→ R(u, n)u of the subspace of Tp M perpendicular
to u (use (15.46)). We might call this the tidal force operator. Its trace is equal to
− Ric(u, u), as is shown below.
Now let {ej }, for j = 1, 2, 3, be an orthonormal frame perpendicular to u, which
is parallel transported along an arbitrary geodesic of the congruence (according to
the discussion in Sect. 2.10, this is a non-rotating frame of reference). Since n is
orthogonal to u, it has the expansion
n = n i ei .

(3.10)

Note that
 
dni
∇u n = uni ei + ni ∇u ei =

The triad {ej }, together with e0 = u form a tetrad along the chosen geodesic. From
(3.9) we obtain

or

Equation (3.11) (or (3.12)) describes the relative acceleration (“tidal forces”) of
neighboring freely falling test bodies.

Summary Variations of the gravitational “field strengths” are described by the
Riemann tensor. The tensor character of this quantity implies that such inhomoμ
geneities, unlike the field strengths Γ αβ , cannot be transformed away. Relative accelerations or tidal forces of freely falling test bodies are described by the Riemann
tensor, via the equation of geodesic deviation (3.9) or (3.11) for an adapted tetrad.
These remarks are also important for understanding the effect of a gravitational
wave on a mechanical detector (see Sect. 5.3).

where a = ∇u u and ⊥ denotes the projection orthogonal to u. (Important consequences of this equation, in particular the Landau–Raychaudhuri equation, are studied, for instance, in [10].)
Exercise 3.4 Consider a static Lorentz manifold (M, g). We know (see Sect. 2.9)
that this is locally isometric to a direct product manifold R × Σ with metric
g = −ϕ 2 dt 2 + h,

(3.18)

where h is a Riemannian metric on Σ and ϕ is a smooth function on Σ. (More accurately, one should write in (3.18) π ∗ h instead of h, where π denotes the projection
from R × Σ to the second factor.) Show that the function ϕ satisfies the equation

Solution We first give some hints for an elementary derivation, and then show how
the result can be obtained in a straightforward manner with the help of Cartan’s
structure equations (see DG, Sect. 15.7).


Hints Use the Killing equation for the Killing field K = ∂/∂t and d( K

ϕ2
show first that ϕuα;β = −uβ ϕ,α . This implies that a = ∇u u is given by aα =
−( ϕ1 )ϕ,α and that uα;β = aα uβ . Then express the divergence of aα in two different ways.
We introduce an orthonormal tetrad {θ μ } on R × Σ consisting of θ 0 = ϕ dt and
an orthonormal triad {θ i }, i = 1, 2, 3, of (Σ, h). The connection forms of (Σ, h)
μ
relative to {θ i } are denoted by ω̄ij and those of (M, g) relative to {θ μ } by ω ν . Bars
always refer to quantities on (Σ, h). (We identify, for instance, θ i with the pull-back
π ∗ θ i .)

3.2 The Gravitational Field Equations
You will be convinced of the general theory of relativity once you have studied it. Therefore
I am not going to defend it with a single word.
—A. Einstein
(On a postcard to A. Sommerfeld, Feb. 8, 1916)

In the absence of true gravitational fields one can always find a coordinate system
in which gμν = ημν everywhere. This is the case when the Riemann tensor vanishes
(modulo global questions, as discussed in Sect. 15.9 of DG). One might call this
fact the “zeroth law of gravitation”. In the presence of gravitational fields, spacetime will become curved. The field equations must describe the dependence of the
curvature of the metric field on the energy-momentum distributions in terms of partial differential equations.

3.2 The Gravitational Field Equations

73

3.2.1 Heuristic “Derivation” of the Field Equations
As a starting point for the arguments which will lead to the field equations we recall
from Sect. 2.5 that for a weak, quasi-stationary field generated by a non-relativistic
mass distribution, the component g00 of the metric tensor (relative to a suitable
coordinate system which is nearly Lorentzian on a global scale) is related to the
Newtonian potential by
g00 ≃ −(1 + 2φ).

(3.31)

The Newtonian potential φ satisfies the Poisson equation
Δφ = 4πGρ.

(3.32)

We have seen that the left-hand side of (3.32) is equal to minus the trace of the tidal
tensor (3.15). According to (3.17) this corresponds to Rμν uμ uν in GR for a freely
falling observer with four-velocity uμ . On the other hand, ρ in the Poisson equation
μ
is approximatively equal to Tμν uμ uν and T = T μ under Newtonian conditions. So
the GR-analogue of Poisson’s equation is


Rμν uμ uν = 4πG λTμν + (1 − λ)gμν T uμ uν ,
where λ is a constant to be determined. Since this should hold for all observers, we
are led to the equation


Rμν = 4πG λTμν + (1 − λ)gμν T .
Using the trace of this equation one finds that it is equivalent to


1
Gμν = 4πG λTμν − (2 − λ)gμν T ,
2

(3.33)

where Gμν is the Einstein tensor (see DG, Eq. (15.54))
1
Gμν = Rμν − gμν R,
2

R = R μμ .

(3.34)

From Sect. 2.4 we know that the energy-momentum tensor must satisfy ∇ν T μν = 0.
If we use this in (3.33) and also the reduced Bianchi identity
∇ν Gμν = 0,

(3.35)

we conclude that for λ = 2 the trace T would have to be constant. This unphysical
condition is avoided for λ = 2. We are thus naturally led to Einstein’s field equations


1
Rμν = 8πG Tμν − gμν T
or Gμν = 8πGTμν .

25 November 1915.4
Remark Let us consider a static solution of the Einstein equations for an ideal fluid
at rest. Using the notation in Exercise 3.4 the fluid four-velocity is u = ϕ1 ∂t , and we
obtain from (2.32) and (3.19) the following exact GR-version of Poisson’s equation

Note the combination ρ + 3p as the source of the potential ϕ.

3.2.2 The Question of Uniqueness
A chief attraction of the theory lies in its logical completeness. If a single one of the conclusions drawn from it proves wrong, it must be given up; to modify it without destroying the
whole structure seems to be impossible.
—A. Einstein (1919)

Now that we have motivated the field equations with simple physical arguments, we
must ask how uniquely they are determined. The following investigation will show
that one has very little freedom.
It is natural to postulate that the ten potentials gμν satisfy equations of the form
Dμν [g] = Tμν ,

(3.38)

where Dμν [g] is a tensor field constructed pointwise from gμν and its first and
second derivatives. Furthermore, this tensor valued local functional should satisfy
the identity
∇ν Dμν = 0,

(3.39)

in order to guarantee that ∇ν T μν = 0 is a consequence of the field equations.
4 Among historians, there have recently been controversial discussions after the claim in [78] that

D. Hilbert had not found the definite equations a few days earlier. Archival material reveals that
Hilbert revised the proofs of his paper [79] in a major way, after he had seen Einstein’s publication
from November 25. We may never know exactly what happened in November 1915. I prefer to
quote from a letter of Einstein to Hilbert on December 20, 1915: “On this occasion I feel compelled
to say something else to you that is of much more importance to me. There has been a certain illfeeling between us, the cause of which I do not wish to analyze. I have struggled against the feeling
of bitterness attached to it, and this with success. I think of you again with unmixed congeniality
and I ask that you try to do the same with me. Objectively it is a shame when two real fellows who
have managed to extricate themselves somewhat from this shabby world do not give one another
pleasure.”

3.2 The Gravitational Field Equations

75

Remarks
1. The requirement that the field equations contain derivatives of gμν only up to
second order is certainly reasonable. If this were not the case, one would have
to specify for the Cauchy problem the initial values not only for the metric and
its first derivative, but also higher derivatives on a spacelike surface, in order to
determine the development of the metric.
2. Since ∇ν T μν = 0 is also a consequence of the non-gravitational laws (see
Sect. 2.4), the coupled system of equations contains four identities. As we shall
later discuss in more detail, general invariance of the theory implies this. Indeed, general invariance is a kind of gauge invariance: Solutions of the coupled
dynamical system—consisting of gravitational and matter equations—that can
be transformed into each other by a diffeomorphism, are physically equivalent.
Since the diffeomorphism group can (locally) be described by four smooth functions, the existence of four identities in the coupled system is necessary. This is
completely analogous to the situation in gauge field theories. (More on this in
Sect. 3.3.6.) On the linearized level, this was already discussed in Sect. 2.2 (see,
in particular, Eqs. (2.10) and (2.14)).
It is very satisfying that in four spacetime dimensions the following theorem
holds:
Theorem 3.1 (Lovelock) A tensor Dμν [g] with the required properties is in four
dimensions a linear combination of the metric and the Einstein tensor
Dμν [g] = aGμν + bgμν ,

(3.40)

where a, b ∈ R.
Remarks This theorem was established relatively late (see [101]). Previously one
had made the additional assumption that the tensor Dμν [g] was linear in the second
derivatives. It is remarkable that it is unnecessary to postulate linearity in the second
derivatives only in four dimensions.5 It is also by no means trivial that it is not necessary to require the symmetry of Dμν . The theorem thus shows that a gravitational
field satisfying (3.38) cannot be coupled to a non-symmetric energy-momentum
tensor.
We first prove the following
Theorem 3.2 Let K[g] be a functional which assigns to every smooth pseudoRiemannian metric field g a tensor field K (of arbitrary type) such that the components of K[g] at the point p ∈ M depend smoothly on gij and its derivatives
5 In higher dimensions additional terms are possible. We shall state Lovelock’s general result at the
end of Sect. 3.6.

elementary operations of tensor algebra.
Proof In normal coordinates (see Sect. 15.3 of DG) the geodesics are straight lines
x i (s) = sa i . Hence,


(3.41)
Γ kij sa m a i a j = 0,
with arbitrary constants a i . Since Γ is symmetric, we have Γ kij (0) = 0, implying
gij,k = 0. Furthermore, at x = 0 we can bring gij to normal form: gij (0) = εi δij ,
with εi = ±1. In a neighborhood of x = 0 we may then expand in powers of x i
1
gik = εi δij + βik,rs x r x s + · · · .

(3.42)

From (3.41) we have Γ kij (x)x i x j = 0 and hence
Γikr (x)x k x r = 0.

(3.43)

If we insert (3.42) into (3.43) we obtain
(βik,rs + βir,ks − βkr,is )x k x r x s = 0.

Thus Rirks , expressed in terms of normal coordinates, determines all the second

We now prove Theorem 3.1 under the additional assumption that Dμν [g] is linear in the second derivatives. (For the generalization we refer once more to [101].

Einstein’s Field Equations

Unfortunately, the proof of Lovelock’s theorem is too complicated to be reproduced
here.)
μ

Partial proof of Theorem 3.1 Since the R αβγ are linear in the second derivatives of
the gμν , Theorem 3.2 implies that Dμν [g] must have the following form
Dμν [g] = c1 Rμν + c2 Rgμν + c3 gμν ,

with constants c1 , c2 and c3 . As a result of the contracted Bianchi identity G

Hence c2 + 12 c1 = 0, and Dμν must be of the form (3.40).



Theorem 3.1 implies that the field equations having the structure (3.38), with the
required properties for Dμν [g], must be of the form
Gμν = κTμν − Λgμν ,

(3.51)

where Λ and κ are two constants. The field equations (3.51) are highly non-linear
partial differential equations, even in vacuum. This must be so, since every form of
energy, including the “energy of the gravitational field”, is a source of gravitational
fields. This non-linearity makes a detailed analysis of the field equations extremely
difficult. Fortunately, one has found a number of physically relevant exact solutions.
Beside this, qualitative insight has been gained, for example, by the study of the
initial value problem (see Sect. 3.8). As in any other field of physics, approximation
methods allow us to treat relevant problems, such as binaries of compact objects
(see Chaps. 5 and 6). And, of course, numerical methods are playing an increasingly
important role, especially in investigations of highly dynamical processes.
Remarks
1. The energy-momentum tensor T μν must be obtained from a theory of matter (just
as is the case for the current density j μ in Maxwell’s equations). We shall discuss
the construction of T μν (and j μ ) in the framework of a Lagrangian field theory
in Sect. 3.3. In practical applications one often uses simple phenomenological
models (such as ideal or viscous fluids).
2. We shall obtain the field equations in the next section from a variational principle.

3.2.3 Newtonian Limit, Interpretation of the Constants Λ and κ
The field equations (3.51) contain two constants Λ and κ. In order to interpret them,
we consider the Newtonian limit. We need
Rμν = ∂λ Γ λνμ − ∂ν Γ λλμ + Γ σνμ Γ λλσ − Γ σλμ Γ λνσ .

3.2 The Gravitational Field Equations

As in Sect. 2.5, we can introduce a nearly Lorentzian system for weak, quasistationary fields, in which
gμν = ημν + hμν ,

|hμν |  1,

(3.52)

and hμν is almost independent of time. We may neglect the quadratic terms Γ Γ of
the Ricci tensor,
Rμν ≃ ∂λ Γ λμν − ∂ν Γ λλμ .
Since the field is quasi-stationary, we have R00 ≃ ∂l Γ l00 and Γ l00 ≃ − 12 ∂l g00 . In the
Newtonian limit, we have g00 ≃ −(1 + 2φ). We thus find, as already suggested by
(3.17),
R00 ≃ Δφ.
Equation (3.51) is equivalent to

with κ = 8πG. For non-relativistic matter |Tij |  |T00 |, and hence we obtain
for Λ = 0 the Poisson equation (3.32) for the (0, 0) component of (3.54), using
Eq. (3.53). A small non-zero Λ in (3.51) leads to
Δφ = 4πGρ − Λ.

3.2.4 On the Cosmological Constant Λ
We shall now say more on the mysterious Λ-term in (3.51). This term was introduced by Einstein when he applied GR for the first time to cosmology. In his influential paper [80] of 1917 he proposed a static cosmological model which is spatially
closed. His assumption that the Universe is quasistatic was not unreasonable at the
time, because the relative velocities of stars as observed were small. The completely
novel assumption that space is closed had to do with Machian ideas about inertia.6
6 In these early years, Einstein believed that GR should satisfy what he named Mach’s principle, in
the sense that the metric field should be determined uniquely by the energy-momentum tensor (see
Einstein’s paper [80]). His intention was to eliminate all vestiges of absolute space. For a detailed
discussion we refer to the last part of his Princeton lectures [83]. Only later Einstein came to realize
that the metric field is not an epiphenomenon of matter, but has an independent existence, and his
enthusiasm for Mach’s principle decreased. In a letter to F. Pirani he wrote in 1954: “As a matter
of fact, one should no longer speak of Mach’s principle at all.” For more on this, see [71].

Einstein’s Field Equations

More precisely, Einstein’s cosmological model (M, g) is
M = R × Sa3 ,

g = −dt 2 + h,

(3.57)

where Sa3 is the 3-sphere with radius a and h its standard metric. The Ricci and
Einstein tensors for the metric (3.57) can be obtained by specializing the results of
Exercise 3.4. We need only the time-time components, and obtain
1
G00 = R̄,
2

R00 = 0,

(3.58)

where R̄ is the Riemann scalar of Sa3 . For this space of constant curvature one finds
(see Exercise 3.8) R̄ = a62 , thus
G00 =

.

(3.59)

With these geometrical results we go into Einstein’s field equation. Because of the
symmetries of the model, the energy-momentum tensor must have the following
diagonal form
(Tμν ) = diag(ρ, p, p, p).

From (3.36) we obtain

Einstein first tried to solve his original field equations from November 1915 (without
the Λ-term). Then, however, (3.62) cannot be satisfied for p ≥ 0 (e.g., for dust).
It was this failure that led him to introduce the Λ-term7 as a possibility which is
compatible with the principles of GR. Indeed, as we have seen, nothing forbids the
presence of this term. With its inclusion the two equations (3.61) and (3.62) can be
satisfied and lead for dust (p = 0) to the two basic relations
4πGρ =

a2

(3.63)

of Einstein’s cosmological model. For obvious reasons, the Λ-term is often called
the cosmological term. Because of recent exciting cosmological observations, the
cosmological constant Λ has again become a central issue, both for cosmology and
particle physics. Before indicating that there is a deep mystery connected with the

in 1916, but discarded it without justification.

pΛ = −ρΛ .

(3.65)

Although a positive Λ corresponds to a positive ρΛ , it has a repulsive effect. This
becomes manifest if we write (3.56) as

Δ̄ϕ = 4πG (ρ + 3p) + (ρΛ + 3pΛ ) .



ϕ

(3.66)

−2ρΛ

Since the energy density and the pressure appear in the combination ρ + 3p, we
understand that a positive ρΛ leads to a repulsion. In the Newtonian limit we have
ϕ ≃ 1 + φ and p  ρ, hence we obtain the modified Poisson equation
Δφ = 4πG(ρ − 2ρΛ ).

(3.67)

Without gravity, we do not care about the absolute energy of the vacuum, because
only energy differences matter. However, when we consider the coupling to gravity,
the vacuum energy ρvac acts like a cosmological constants. In order to see this, first
consider the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor operator in
Minkowski spacetime. Since the vacuum state is Lorentz invariant, this expectation
value is an invariant symmetric tensor, hence proportional to the metric tensor. For
a curved metric we expect that this is still the case, up to higher curvature terms
Tμν vac = gμν ρvac + higher curvature terms.

(3.68)

The effective cosmological constant, which controls the large scale behavior of the
Universe, is given by
Λ = 8πGρvac + Λ0 ,

(3.69)

where Λ0 is a bare cosmological constant in Einstein’s field equations.
We know from astronomical observations that ρΛ cannot be larger than about the
so-called critical density
ρcrit =

Einstein’s Field Equations

where H0 is the Hubble parameter and h0 = H0 /(100 km s−1 Mpc−1 ). Observationally, h0 ≃ 0.7.
It is complete mystery as to why the two terms in (3.69) should almost exactly
cancel. This is the famous Λ-problem. It is true that we are unable to calculate
the vacuum energy density in quantum field theories, like the Standard Model of
particle physics. But we can attempt to make what appear to be reasonable orderof-magnitude estimates for the various contributions. These expectations turn out to
be in gigantic conflict with the facts. For a detailed discussion of this and extensive
references, see [102, 103] and Part VII of [35].

3.2.5 The Einstein–Fokker Theory
One can obtain field equations different from those of Einstein if one limits a priori
the degrees of freedom of the metric tensor (beyond the requirement that the signature be Lorentzian). For example, one might require that the metric be conformally
flat, i.e., that g has the form
g = φ 2 (x)η,

(3.71)

where η is a flat metric, so that the corresponding Riemann tensor vanishes, and φ
is a function. According to DG, Sect. 15.10 conformal flatness is locally equivalent
to the vanishing of the Weyl tensor. Since the metric (3.71) contains only one scalar
degree of freedom φ(x), we need a scalar equation. The only possibility which
satisfies the requirement that φ appears linearly in the second derivatives is
R = 24πGT ,

(3.72)

μ

where T = T μ and R is the scalar Riemann curvature. The constants have been
chosen such that in the Newtonian limit Eq. (3.72) reduces to the Poisson equation. This scalar theory was considered by Einstein and Fokker; in the linearized
approximation it agrees with the original Nordstrøm theory (see Sect. 2.2). As we
emphasized previously, there is no bending of light rays in such a theory. In addition,
the precession of the perihelion of Mercury is not correctly predicted.
However, this scalar theory does satisfy the principle of equivalence. Thus we
have an example to demonstrate that the equivalence principle alone (without additional assumptions) does not predict a (global) bending of light rays.

(the right-hand side is formed with the Euclidean metric), and conclude from this
that for the particular ψ in (3.76) this becomes
R = kn(n − 1).

We used this for the Einstein universe (n = 3): R = a62 . Energetic students may
compute the Riemann tensor, with the result
Rij kl = k(gik gj l − gil gj k ).

(3.79)

3.3 Lagrangian Formalism
In this section we shall obtain Einstein’s field equations from an action principle.
This will enable us to give a general formula for the energy-momentum tensor in the
framework of a Lagrangian field theory, and to show that its covariant divergence
vanishes as a consequence of the equations for the matter fields. In this connection
we shall discuss the necessity for four identities in the coupled dynamical system,
and point out the close analogy with electrodynamics. We begin with a mathematical
supplement.

3.3.1 Canonical Measure on a Pseudo-Riemannian Manifold
In DG, Sect. 14.6.1 the canonical (Riemannian) volume form η for an oriented
pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M, g) is introduced, and in Sect. 14.7.2 the integral
of f η is defined, where f is a continuous function with compact support. This provides a linear functional on the space of continuous functions with compact support,
and thus by Riesz’s representation theorem a unique positive Borel measure dvg on
the σ -algebra of Borel sets on M. We call dvg the canonical or Riemannian measure on (M, g). Here we add that this measure can also be introduced if M is not
orientable. Moreover, Gauss’ theorem still holds.
The measure dvg is naturally defined as follows. For any smooth coordinate
transformation {x i } −→ {x̄ i } we have for the determinants of the metric tensor
 k


∂x
.
(3.80)
ḡ(x̄) = g(x) det
∂ x̄ l
From this, and the transformation formula for integrals, it follows that for a continuous function f with compact support in a coordinate patch U ⊂ M, the integral



f dvg :=
f (x) g(x) d 4 x
(3.81)
M

U

is independent of the coordinate system. If the support of f is not in the domain
of a chart, we define the integral with the help of a partition of unity, exactly as

3.3 Lagrangian Formalism

85

for the integration of n-forms (see DG, Sect. 14.7.1). Again, this provides a linear
functional of such functions and thus a measure dvg on M. One often says that dvg
is the measure associated to the metric g. (Usually the index g will be dropped if
no confusion can arise.) In local coordinates the Riemannian measure is given by

dvg = g(x) d 4 x.
(3.82)
For a proof of the divergence theorem for non-orientable manifolds, see [56].

3.3.2 The Einstein–Hilbert Action
We show below that a Lagrangian density L[g], whose Euler–Lagrange derivative
is equal to (3.40) in Lovelock’s theorem, is given by a linear function of the Riemann scalar R[g] : L[g] = aR[g] − 2b. In the next section we shall also see that the
variational derivative of any invariant functional L[g] has always a vanishing covariant divergence. Therefore, Lovelock’s theorem implies that in four dimensions
a linear function of the Riemann scalar R[g] is, up to a total divergence,8 the most
general Lagrangian density, whose Euler–Lagrange derivative contains no higher
than second order derivatives of the metric field. The additional freedom in higher
dimensions will be mentioned in Sect. 3.6.
These remarks lead us to study variations of the Einstein–Hilbert action functional

R[g] dvg ,
(3.83)
SD [g] =
D

where D is a compact region with smooth boundary ∂D. We write everything for
a Lorentz manifold, but the formalism is independent of the number of dimensions.
Assume, for simplicity, that D is contained in a coordinate patch, but the final result
(Eq. (3.84) below) is independent of this. Variational derivatives (∂/∂ε|ε=0 for a 1parameter family of metrics gε , −α < ε < α) will be denoted by the letter δ (not to
be confused with the codifferential).
It was shown by Einstein and Hilbert9 that the functional derivative of (3.83) is
proportional to the Einstein tensor. More precisely, we show that the first variation
of (3.83) is given by

where W is a vector field defined later.
8 An interesting functional of g, which in four dimensions is locally a total divergence, is the Gauss–

Bonnet scalar discussed in Exercise 3.18.
9 In the light of recent historical studies it is no more justified to attribute the action principle
entirely to Hilbert. For a detailed discussion and references we refer to [104]. Beside Einstein and
Hilbert, also H.A. Lorentz published a series of papers on general relativity based on a variational
principle.

We first consider δRμν . Recall
Rμν = ∂α Γ αμν − ∂ν Γ αμα + Γ ρμν Γ αρα − Γ ρμα Γ αρν .
Things are enormously simplified by using a normal system of coordinates with
origin p ∈ D. Then we have at p:




δRμν = ∂α δΓ αμν − ∂ν δΓ αμα .
Now, the variations δΓ αμν of the Christoffel symbols transform as tensors, as is
obvious from the transformation law DG, Eq. (15.4). At p we can therefore write




(3.86)
δRμν = ∇α δΓ αμν − ∇ν δΓ αμα .
Since this is a tensor equation, known as the Palatini identity, it holds everywhere
in every coordinate system. It implies
g μν δRμν = W α;α ,

(3.87)

W α = g μν δΓ αμν − g αν δΓ μμν .

(3.88)

where W α is the vector field

Thus the first term on the right of (3.85) is the volume integral of div W .

We shall later interpret the boundary term in (3.84) geometrically in terms of the
second fundamental form (extrinsic curvature) of ∂D (see Sect. 3.6).

3.3.3 Reduced Bianchi Identity and General Invariance
We can use the variational equation (3.91) to obtain another derivation of the reduced Bianchi identity (this presentation assumes familiarity with DG, Chap. 14).
For the moment we shall keep the discussion more general, so that we can make use
of it later in other contexts.
Consider a 4-form Ω[ψ], which is a functional of certain (tensor) fields ψ. We
assume that it is generally invariant in the following sense


ϕ ∗ Ω[ψ] = Ω ϕ ∗ (ψ) ,
(3.95)
for all ϕ ∈ Diff(M). In particular, (3.95) is valid for the flow φt of a vector field X.
Hence, it follows by differentiating with respect to t for t = 0 that


d
LX Ω[ψ] =
Ω φt∗ (ψ) .

We integrate this equation over a region D which has a smooth boundary and compact closure. From Cartan’s formula (see DG, Sect. 14.5)
LX = d ◦ iX + iX ◦ d,

and Stokes’ theorem we find

when X vanishes on the boundary ∂D. Thus, we have

d
Ω φt∗ (ψ) = 0.

(3.96)

In particular, we obtain from (3.91) and (3.96), for δgμν = (LX g)μν and Ω =
(Rη)[g],

Gμν (LX g)μν η = 0.
(3.97)
D

(Recall that (LX g)μν is a special variational derivative, determined by a local flow
of the vector field X.)
The components of the Lie derivative LX g are (see DG, Chap. 13)
(LX g)μν = X λ gμν,λ + gλν X λ,μ + gμλ X λ,ν .

(3.98)

In a normal system with origin in p this reduces to
(LX g)μν = Xμ,ν + Xν,μ .
Thus, in an arbitrary coordinate system we have the useful expression
(LX g)μν = Xμ;ν + Xν;μ .

(3.99)

(Of course, the indices can be interpreted abstractly.) This equation also follows
from (2.120). Hence,

According to Gauss’ theorem the first term vanishes. Since D and the values of Xμ
in D are arbitrary, the contracted Bianchi identity


μν
G ;ν = 0 ∇ν Gμν = 0
must hold.
The contracted Bianchi identity shows that the vacuum field equations Gμν +
Λgμν = 0 are not independent. That this must be the case becomes apparent from
the following considerations. Suppose that g is a vacuum solution. For every diffeomorphism φ the diffeomorphically transformed field φ ∗ (g) must also be a vacuum
solution, since g and φ ∗ (g) are physically equivalent. The field equations can thus

3.3 Lagrangian Formalism

89

only determine equivalence classes of diffeomorphic metric fields. Since Diff(M)
has four “degrees of freedom”, we expect four identities.
Equivalently, one may argue as follows: For every solution of the gμν as functions
of particular coordinates, one can find a coordinate transformation such that four of
the gμν can be made to take on arbitrary values. Hence only six of the ten field
equations for the gμν can be independent.
A similar situation exists in electrodynamics. The fields Aμ are physically equivalent within a “gauge class”. The function χ in the gauge transformation
Aμ −→ Aμ + ∂μ χ
is arbitrary and for this reason an identity must hold in the field equations for the
Aμ . In vacuum, these become
Aμ − ∂μ ∂ν Aν = 0.
The left-hand side identically satisfies


∂ μ Aμ − ∂μ ∂ν Aν = 0,
and this is the identity we are looking for. This can be extended to non-Abelian
gauge theories. We shall generalize this discussion to the coupled matter-field system further on.

3.3.4 Energy-Momentum Tensor in a Lagrangian Field Theory
In a Lagrangian field theory one can give a general formula for the energymomentum tensor.
Let L be the Lagrangian density for a set of “matter fields” ψA , for A = 1, . . . , N
(we include the electromagnetic field among the fields ψA ). For simplicity, we consider only tensor fields (spinor fields in GR will be introduced in Chap. 9). If we
assume that we know L from local physics in flat space, the principle of equivalence prescribes the form of L in the presence of a gravitational field. We must
simply write gμν in place of ημν and replace ordinary derivatives by covariant ones,
as we discussed in Sect. 2.4. Thus (dropping the index A) we have
L = L(ψ, ∇ψ, g).

(3.100)

For example, the Lagrangian density for the electromagnetic field is
L=−

The proof of T ;ν = 0 is very similar to the derivation of the Bianchi identity in Sect. 3.2. We start with (3.96), which is valid for every invariant functional

Remark In SR the energy-momentum tensor is usually derived from the translation invariance. This results in the conserved canonical energy-momenttum tensor,
which is in general not symmetric, but which can always be symmetrized. One could
also use the above procedure in SR: replace formally ημν by a curved metric gμν ,
use (3.107) and then set gμν equal to the flat metric at the end. The resulting tensor is then divergenceless (by (3.110)) and symmetric. The relationship of the two
procedures is discussed in [114].

3.3.5 Analogy with Electrodynamics
The definition of T μν is similar to the definition of the current density j μ in electrodynamics. We decompose the full Lagrangian L for matter into a part LF for the
electromagnetic field and a term LM , which contains the interaction between the
charged fields and the electromagnetic field. As before,
LF = −

This equation is thus a consequence of Maxwell’s equations on the one hand, beμν
cause of the identity F ;ν;μ = 0. On the other hand it also follows from the matter
equations (the Euler–Lagrange equations for LM ). This means that the coupled system of Maxwell’s equations and matter equations is not independent. This must be
χ
the case, since the transformed fields {Aμ , ψ χ }, obtained from a solution {Aμ , ψ}
of the coupled equations for matter and the electromagnetic field, is an equivalent
solution. (These remarks are easily generalized to Yang–Mills theories.)

Einstein’s Field Equations

3.3.6 Meaning of the Equation ∇ · T = 0
μν

In general relativity the equation T ;ν = 0 plays a completely analogous role to
(3.115) in electrodynamics. For every solution {g, ψ} of the coupled system of gravitational and matter equations (we now include the electromagnetic field among the
matter fields), and every ϕ ∈ Diff(M), {ϕ ∗ (g), ϕ ∗ (ψ)} is a physically equivalent solution. We expect thus four identities, since Diff(M) has four degrees of freedom.
(Instead of “active” diffeomorphisms, we could just as well consider “passive” coordinate transformations.) These four identities are a result of the fact that (as was first
emphasized by Hilbert) ∇ · T = 0 is a consequence of both the matter equations and
the gravitational field equations. The role of the gauge group of electrodynamics is
now taken over by the group Diff(M), which of course is non-Abelian.

3.3.7 The Equations of Motion and ∇ · T = 0
If we take T μν to be the energy-momentum tensor of an ideal fluid with pressure
p = 0 (incoherent dust),
T μν = ρuμ uν ,
it follows from T

(3.116)

ρu ;μ = 0,

(3.117)

∇u u = 0.

(3.118)

whence

Therefore, the integral curves of u (streamlines) are geodesics. This law of motion
is thus a consequence of the field equations. In the exercises we shall see other
examples for this interesting connection.
Equation (3.117) says that a comoving quantity of fluid is conserved, that is

and D is arbitrary, this conservation is equivalent to
Lu (ρη) = 0.

(3.119)

This, in turn, is equivalent to (3.117), because
Lu (ρη) = (Lu ρ)η + ρLu η = (∇u ρ + ρ∇ · u)η = ∇ · (ρu)η.

3.4 Non-localizability of the Gravitational Energy

97

In deriving this one has to make use of the boundary term (3.94). Deduce from this a
generalized reduced Bianchi identity. Note that the variational derivative in (3.128)
is of fourth order in the metric, in agreement with Lovelock’s theorem.

3.4 Non-localizability of the Gravitational Energy
In SR the conservation laws for energy and momentum of a closed system are a
consequence of the invariance with respect to translations in time and space. Except
for special solutions, translations do not act as isometries on a Lorentz manifold
and for this reason a general conservation law for energy and momentum does not
exist in GR. This has been disturbing to many people, but one simply has to get
used to this fact. There is no “energy-momentum tensor for the gravitational field”.
Independently of any formal arguments, Einstein’s equivalence principle tells us
directly that there is no way to localize the energy of the gravitational field: The
μ
“gravitational field” (the connection Γ αβ ) can be locally transformed away. But
if there is no field, there is locally no energy and no momentum. This is closely
analogous to the situation with regard to charge conservation in non-Abelian gauge
theories.
However, it is still possible to define the total energy and total momentum of an
isolated system with an asymptotically flat geometry. In a cosmological context this
is, however, in general not possible. (We shall discuss this in detail in Sect. 3.7.)
At this point, we shall merely show the following: If a Killing field K exists, i.e.,
a field K such that LK g = 0, then a conservation law follows from ∇ · T = 0 for the
vector field
P μ = T μν Kν .

(3.129)

other words the components of the well-known angular momentum density.

3.5 On Covariance and Invariance
Few words have been abused by physicists more than relativity, symmetry, covariance, invariance and gauge or coordinate transformation.
—A. Trautman (1972)

Confusions around these concepts began already in 1917 when E. Kretschmann first
pointed out that the principle of general covariance has no physical content whatever. By appropriate reformulations of a theory, the covariance group can always be
enlarged. Well known examples are the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations
of classical mechanics. In the former the covariance group is the diffeomorphism
group of configuration space, while in Hamilton’s theory it becomes the larger symplectic group of phase space (the cotangent bundle of configuration space). It is also
clear that the laws of SR can be made generally covariant. Einstein entirely concurred with Kretschmann’s view, but emphasized the ‘heuristic value’ of the covariance principle. This was the beginning of one of the most confusing chapters in the
history of GR with strange discussions over decades. (See [81] for an authoritative
account.)
Unfortunately, it took a long time until a clear distinction between the notions of
covariance and invariance was made. In a textbook this was for the first time done
by J.L. Anderson, [11]. Below we give an abridged version of this discussion.
The heart of Anderson’s clarification is a distinction between absolute and dynamical objects. Before we attempt to give general definitions on the basis of field
equations, the following examples should be helpful and illustrate the main points.
We consider three “theories” for a symmetric tensor field g of signature
(−1, 1, 1, 1) on R4 , regarded as a differentiable manifold:
(a)
(b)
(c)

Rμναβ [g] = 0;
R[g] = 0,
Rμν [g] = 0.

Cμναβ [g] = 0;

In all three cases the group Diff(R4 ) is a covariance group, because the Riemann
tensor, its contractions, and the Weyl tensor satisfy the covariance property


(3.134)
Riem ϕ ∗ g = ϕ ∗ Riem[g] , etc.

3.5 On Covariance and Invariance

99

The “theory” (a) just says that the metric field g is the Minkowski metric. It has
no dynamical degrees of freedom, and is the prototype of an absolute object: Each
solution of the “field equation” (a) is of the form
 
(3.135)
g = ϕ∗ η, ϕ ∈ Diff R4 ,
where η is the standard metric
η = ημν dx μ dx ν ,

(ημν ) = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1).

(3.136)

The theory (b) is just the Einstein–Fokker theory, discussed at the end of
Sect. 3.2. The vanishing of the Weyl tensor implies that g is conformally flat. In
other words, g is of the form


 
g = ϕ∗ φ 2 η , ϕ ∈ Diff R4 ,
(3.137)
where φ is a scalar field. This is the only dynamical degree of freedom. The first
equation in (b) implies that φ satisfies the field equation
η φ = 0.

(3.138)

The conformal structure in this theory is absolute: The object g̃μν = gμν /(−g)1/4
is an absolute tensor density, in that it is diffeomorphic (as a tensor density) to ημν
(as in (3.135)).
Finally, (c) is Einstein’s vacuum theory of the gravitational field. In this theory,
g is a fully dynamical object.
Which subgroups of the common covariance group Diff(R4 ) of the three theories
should we consider as invariance groups? With Anderson we adopt the definition
that the invariance group consists of those elements of which leave the absolute objects invariant. For (a) this is the inhomogeneous Lorentz group, for (b) it is the conformal group, which is a finite dimensional Lie group (see [37], p. 352), and for (c)
the invariance group agrees with the covariance group. In particular, the Einstein–
Fokker theory is generally covariant (as emphasized in the original paper), however,
not generally invariant. In GR, on the other hand, the metric is entirely dynamical,
and for this reason, “general relativity” is an appropriate naming.
Given a theory with a set of fields of various types and field equations, we can formalize the concepts of absolute and dynamical objects, and give general definitions
of the invariance and covariance groups. The examples discussed above suggest how
this has to be done. First we recall what we mean by a covariance group.
Definition 3.1 Given a set of fields on a differentiable manifold M, collectively
denoted by F(x), and corresponding field equations
D[F] = 0,

(3.139)

we say that G ⊂ Diff(M) is a covariance group, if to each ϕ ∈ G there is a map
F −→ ϕ∗ F , such that

100

3

Einstein’s Field Equations

(i) ϕ −→ ϕ∗ is a realization of G: id∗ = id, (ϕ1 ◦ ϕ2 )∗ = ϕ1∗ ◦ ϕ2∗ for ϕ1 , ϕ2 ∈ G;
(ii) With F also ϕ∗ F satisfies the field equations (3.139).
The action of G on the fields defines an equivalence relation.
Definition 3.2 Two solutions F1 and F2 of (3.139) are equivalent relative to the
covariance group G, if there exists a ϕ ∈ G such that ϕ∗ F1 = F2 .
It is obvious that this defines an equivalence relation. The corresponding equivalence classes are called G-classes.
Next, we isolate in an intrinsic fashion the absolute elements.
Definition 3.3 Assume that a subset A ⊂ F of fields has the following property:
Each G-class contains all solutions of the fields in A. (There is only one G-class
for A.) Then the fields in A are absolute objects. The non-absolute elements are
dynamical.
Remarks
1. This definition is for G = Diff(M) or for groups of (local) gauge transformations
in Yang–Mills theories a bit too narrow (for general manifolds), and should be
replaced by an obvious local version. (For this I refer to [35], p. 105-.)
2. Absolute elements can usually brought in some charts into a standard form,
given in terms of a set of fixed numerical constants (like the flat metric in SR,
Eq. (3.136)).
3. It may happen that by an unfortunate choice of the independent fields of the
theory, a field is absolute according to our definition, while this is not the case
physically. An example, mentioned in [82], would be a nowhere-vanishing vector field on a Lorentz manifold. Such vector fields are for instance used in dust
models. The problem disappears, however, if one chooses as independent vector
field the product of the density of the dust and its four-velocity field. Nowherevanishing vector fields, which we would regard as absolute, play an important
role in certain much discussed extensions of GR, called Tensor-Vector-Scalar
theories.
4. It must be admitted that an unambiguous general definition of absolute structures
does not exist, however, in concrete situations usually no problems arise.
At this point, we can say what we mean by invariance or symmetry groups.
Definition 3.4 The subgroup
Inv = {ϕ ∈ G : ϕ∗ A = A, A ∈ A}
is an invariance (symmetry) group of the system (3.139).

3.5 On Covariance and Invariance

101

The reader is invited to illustrate these concepts with other examples. For a more
detailed discussion we refer also to [82]. Note that gauge covariance and gauge
invariance can be distinguished in a similar fashion.

3.5.1 Note on Unimodular Gravity
The volume form ηg of a metric g is, modulo constant factors, an absolute element:
Up to a constant factor, two such forms are locally diffeomorphic.10 This implies
that there are always local coordinates such that | det(gμν )| = 1. Since the volume
forms ηg modulo constant factors are absolute elements11 one may require that the
gravitational action is only stationary with respect to variations of the metric that
preserve ηg , i.e., for which gμν δg μν = 0. For such variations we obtain from the
variational equation

Rμν − gμν R − 8πGTμν δg μν = 0

that is the traceless part of Einstein’s equations.
On the basis of the argument in Sect. 2.4.4, it is justified to assume that T μν ;ν = 0
still holds. Using also the contracted Bianchi identity, we deduce from the modified
field equations the condition ∂μ R = −8πG∂μ T . Hence, R + 8πGT is a constant
(=: 4Λ), and thus the unimodular field equations imply that any solution of them is
also a solution of Einstein’s equations with a cosmological term. But now Λ is an
integration constant and is thus solution dependent.
This alternative interpretation of Λ, which goes back to Einstein [76], does however not solve the Λ-problem. (In vacuum, the unimodular field equations are, for
instance, solved for all Einstein spacetimes, that is for metrics with Rμν = λgμν ,
where λ is any constant.)
Exercise 3.13 Consider a metric field g and a 2-form F , satisfying the coupled
system
Riem(g) = 0,
dF = 0,

δg F = 0.

What are the largest covariance and invariance groups?

3.6 The Tetrad Formalism
In this section we shall formulate Einstein’s field equations in terms of differential forms. This has certain advantages, also for practical calculations. We shall use
Sects. 15.7 and 15.8 of DG.
In the following, {θ α } denotes a (local) basis of 1-forms and {eα } the corresponding dual basis of (local) vector fields. We shall often assume these bases to be orthonormal, so that
g = −θ 0 ⊗ θ 0 +

(3.142)

while the curvature Ω = (Ω αβ ) is a tensor-valued 2-form
Ω̄ = AΩA−1 .

(3.143)

With respect to an orthonormal basis we have (see Eq. (15.70) of DG)
ωαβ + ωβα = 0,

(3.144)

so that ω(x) ∈ so(1, 3), the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. For orthonormal tetrad
fields {θ α }, (3.141) is a spacetime dependent Lorentz transformation

↑

θ̄ (x) = Λ(x)θ (x),

(3.145a)

ω̄(x) = Λ(x)ω(x)Λ−1 (x) − dΛ(x)Λ−1 (x),

(3.145b)

where Λ(x) ∈ L+ (if orientations are preserved). For any given point x0 there is
always a Λ(x) such that ω̄(x0 ) = 0; according to (3.145b), Λ(x) must satisfy the
equation Λ−1 (x0 ) dΛ(x0 ) = ω(x0 ). One can easily convince oneself that this is always possible, since ω(x0 ) ∈ so(1, 3). If ω(x0 ) = 0, then θ α (x) describes a local
inertial frame with origin x0 . At the point x0 , the exterior covariant derivative D
coincides with the exterior derivative d.
Obviously, the metric (3.140) is invariant under the transformation (3.145a). In
analogy to the gauge transformations of electrodynamics (and Yang–Mills theories)
the local Lorentz transformations (3.145a) are also called gauge transformations.
General relativity is invariant with respect to such transformations and is thus a
(special) non-Abelian gauge theory. The tetrad fields {θ α } can be regarded as the
potentials of the gravitational field, since by (3.140), variations of the θ α induce
variations in the metric.

3.6 The Tetrad Formalism

103

The 4-form ∗R = Rη in the Einstein–Hilbert variational principle can be represented in the tetrad formalism as
∗R = ημν ∧ Ωμν ,

(3.146)

where ημν = ∗(θ μ ∧ θ ν ). Indices are raised or lowered with the metric coefficients
gμν , appearing in g = gμν θ μ ⊗ θ ν .
We prove (3.146). Clearly
1
ηαβ ∧ Ω αβ = ηαβ R αβ μν ∧ θ μ ∧ θ ν .
2
From DG, Exercise 14.7 of Sect. 14.6.2, we have

 1
∗ θ μ ∧ θ ν = ηαβσρ g αμ g βν θ σ ∧ θ ρ ,
2
which implies that
1
ηαβ = ηαβσρ θ σ ∧ θ ρ .
2

(3.147)

Hence, we obtain


1
μ
ηαβ ∧ θ μ ∧ θ ν = ηαβσρ θ σ ∧ θ ρ ∧ θ μ ∧ θ ν = δ μα δ νβ − δ β δ να η,

and thus

3.6.1 Variation of Tetrad Fields
Under a variation δθ α of the orthonormal tetrad fields ∗R varies as




δ ηαβ ∧ Ω αβ = δθ α ∧ ηαβγ ∧ Ω βγ + exact differential,

(3.148)

where ηαβγ = ∗(θ α ∧ θ β ∧ θ γ ).
We want to prove (3.148). As for (3.147), one finds that
ηαβγ = ηαβγ δ θ δ .
Now, we have


δ ηαβ ∧ Ω αβ = δηαβ ∧ Ω αβ + ηαβ ∧ δΩ αβ .
From (3.147) and (3.149) we obtain


δηαβ = δ ηαβγ δ θ γ ∧ θ δ = δθ γ ∧ ηαβγ .

(3.149)

Einstein’s Field Equations

The second structure equation gives
δΩ αβ = dδωαβ + δωαλ ∧ ωλβ + ωαλ ∧ δωλβ .
Hence,






δ ηαβ ∧ Ω αβ = δθ λ ∧ ηαβγ ∧ Ω αβ + d ηαβ ∧ δωαβ


− dηαβ ∧ δωαβ + ηαβ ∧ δωαλ ∧ ωλβ + ωαλ ∧ δωλβ .
The last line is equal to δωαβ ∧ Dηαβ . However,
Dηαβ = 0
for the Levi-Civita connection, as we shall show below. We thus obtain






δ ηαβ ∧ Ω αβ = δθ λ ∧ ηαβγ ∧ Ω αβ + d ηαβ ∧ δωαβ ,

(3.150)

(3.151)

i.e. (3.148).
It remains to show that Dηαβ = 0. Relative to an orthonormal system the expression ηαβγ δ is constant. Since orthonormality is preserved under parallel transport
(for a metric connection) we conclude that
Dηαβγ δ = 0.

(3.152)

Together with (3.147) and the first structure equation, this implies

1 
Dηαβ = D ηαβμν θ μ ∧ θ ν = ηαβμν Dθ μ ∧ θ ν
2
= ηαβμν Θ μ ∧ θ ν = Θ μ ∧ ηαβμ ,
thus (3.150) for the Levi-Civita connection.
In the same manner, one can show that
Dηαβγ = 0.
Clearly, both (3.150) and (3.153) hold for any frame.

3.6.2 The Einstein–Hilbert Action
As in (3.148) we split off an exact differential from ∗R. If we use in
∗R = Ω αβ ∧ ηαβ
for Ω αβ the second structure equation, we get


∗R = d ωαβ ∧ ηαβ + ωαβ ∧ dηαβ + ωασ ∧ ωσβ ∧ ηαβ
or with (3.150), i.e.,

(3.153)

3.6 The Tetrad Formalism

105

dηαβ − ωσα ∧ ησβ + ωβσ ∧ ηασ = 0,
we obtain



∗R = d ωαβ ∧ ηαβ + LEH ,

(3.154)

LEH = ωαβ ∧ ωσα ∧ ησβ .

(3.155)

where

The splitting (3.154) and (3.155) is equivalent to the one we derived earlier in Exercise 3.11 of Sect. 3.3. This can easily by verified by using a coordinate basis {dx μ }
for {θ μ } (see Exercise 3.14).

The boundary term can be expressed geometrically, using the results of DG, Appendix A about hypersurfaces. We adapt (locally) the orthonormal basis to ∂D and
use Gauss’ formula (A.3), as well as (A.8a):
ωij = ω̄ij ,

ω0i = −Kij θ j

on ∂D

(3.157)

(bars indicate objects on ∂D). Thus
j

ωαβ ∧ ηαβ = ω̄ij ∧ ηi − 2Kij θ j ∧ η0i

on ∂D.

Now, one can easily see (use Eq. (3.167) below) that
j

θ j ∧ η0i |∂D = δ i Vol∂D .

(3.158)

Hence, we obtain
j

ωαβ ∧ ηαβ |∂D = ω̄ij ∧ ηi − 2 Tr(K̄) Vol∂D .
This gives

The last term in this equation involves only the induced metric on ∂D, and thus gives
no contribution to the variation of the action for variations of the metric which vanish
on ∂D. However, the boundary integral over the trace of the extrinsic curvature has
to be kept. (Examples will be considered later.)

(3.163)

Since the ηαβγ and Ω βγ transforms as tensors, (3.163) holds not only for orthonormal tetrads. Tα is related to the energy-momentum tensor Tαβ by
Tα = Tαβ θ β .

(3.164)

With this identification, (3.163) is in fact equivalent to the field equations in the
classical form

This demonstrates (3.165).
It follows from (3.153) and the second Bianchi identity DΩ = 0 that the absolute

3.6.3 Consequences of the Invariance Properties of the
Lagrangian L
Let us rewrite (3.148) in the form
1
− δ ∗ R = δθ α ∧ ∗Gα + exact differential,
2

(3.169)

with ∗Gα = − 12 ηαβγ ∧ Ω βγ . According to the derivation of (3.165),
Gα = Gαβ θ β ,

(3.170)

where, as usual, Gαβ = Rαβ − 12 gαβ R is the Einstein tensor. We now consider two
special types of variations δθ α .

Local Lorentz Invariance
For an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation in (3.145a) we have
δθ α (x) = λαβ (x)θ β (x),
where (λαβ (x)) ∈ so(1, 3). Since ∗R is invariant under such transformations, it follows from (3.169) that


0 = λαβ θ β ∧ ∗Gα − θ α ∧ ∗Gβ + exact differential.
If we integrate this over a region D such that the support of λ is compact and contained in D, it follows, with λαβ + λβα = 0, that
θ α ∧ ∗Gβ = θ β ∧ ∗Gα
or, using (3.170),
θ α ∧ ηγ Gβγ = θ β ∧ ηγ Gαγ .

(3.171)

108

3

Einstein’s Field Equations

Using also θ α ∧ ηγ = δ αγ η, we get
Gαβ = Gβα .

(3.172)

In the same manner, the local Lorentz invariance of Lmat , together with the equations for matter, imply
Tαβ = Tβα .

(3.173)

Invariance Under Diff(M)
We now produce the variations by Lie derivatives LX , with compact support of
X contained in D. This time we have, as a result of the invariance of ∗R under
Diff(M),
LX θ α ∧ ∗Gα + exact differential = 0,
or

(3.174)


LX θ α ∧ ∗Gα = 0.

(3.175)

D

Since LX θ α = diX θ α + iX dθ α with dθ α = −ωαβ ∧ θ β , we have


LX θ α ∧ ∗Gα = d iX θ α ∧ ∗Gα − iX θ α ∧ d ∗ Gα −

The second term vanishes due to (3.171) and the antisymmetry of ωαβ . Therefore,
we obtain

and from (3.175) we conclude

(3.178)

In an identical manner, the invariance of Lmat , together with the equations for matter, imply
D ∗ Tα = 0.

3.6.4 Lovelock’s Theorem in Higher Dimensions
We mention at this point the generalization of Lovelock’s theorem to dimensions > 4. This is of some relevance for Kaluza–Klein theories.
In four dimensions we know that the most general gravitational Lagrangian density, leading to second order field equations, is (up to an irrelevant total divergence)
L = aη + bΩ αβ ∧ ηαβ ,
where a, b ∈ R. In n dimensions this generalizes to

Note that m = 0 gives a cosmological term. Each of the remaining ones becomes
in dimension m a so-called Euler form (up to a numerical factor) and determines
the Euler characteristic class. Since we shall not make use of this, we illustrate this
point only with an example.

3.6 The Tetrad Formalism

111

The Einstein–Hilbert Lagrangian density Ω αβ ∧ ηαβ becomes in two dimensions
for an orthonormal 2-bein {θ α }
Ω αβ ηαβ = 2Ω 01 η01 = 2Ω 01 = Rη
or, using the second structure equation,
Rη = Ω αβ ηαβ = 2 dω01 .
This is locally exact. Its integral has in the Riemannian case a topological meaning.
According to the Gauss–Bonnet theorem the integral of Rη over a compact twodimensional manifold is 4π times the Euler characteristic (R is twice the Gaussian
curvature). For all this see, e.g., [49].
The situation is similar in higher dimensions. The characteristic classes are, for
instance, treated in S. Kobayashi and K. Nomizu, [41, 42]. One might call the terms
in (3.186) for m > 0 the “dimensionally continued Euler forms”.
The result (3.186) shows that Einstein’s equations in higher dimensions are not
as unique as in four dimensions.

3.7 Energy, Momentum, and Angular Momentum for Isolated
Systems
Far away from an isolated system (like a neutron star), where spacetime is nearly
flat, one expects that mass, momentum, and angular momentum can be defined in
terms of the asymptotically weak gravitational field, and that these quantities are
conserved. Surprisingly, this is an elusive subject in GR, worrying relativists up to
the present day.
In this section we derive the so-called Arnowitt–Deser–Misner (ADM) expressions for energy, momentum, and angular momentum at spatial infinity. These concepts are not very useful for discussing gravitational radiation. For this one has
to define mass and momentum at null infinity, called Bondi mass and momentum.
This construction, introduced in the early 1960s, will be described much later (see
Sect. 6.1).

3.7 Energy, Momentum, and Angular Momentum for Isolated Systems

113

We first rewrite the field equations in the form of a continuity equation, from
which differential “conservation laws” follow immediately. Our starting point is
(3.163) in the form
1
− Ωβγ ∧ ηβγ α = 8πG ∗ Tα .
2

(3.189)

We rewrite the left-hand side with the second structure equation12
Ωβγ = dωβγ − ωαβ ∧ ωσγ .
The contribution of the first term is proportional to


dωβγ ∧ ηβγ α = d ωβγ ∧ ηβγ α + ωβγ ∧ dηβγ α .
According to (3.153) Dη

βγ

(3.190)

(3.191)

α = 0, so that

dηβγ α + ωβσ ∧ ησ γ α + ωγσ ∧ ηβσ α − ωσα ∧ ηβγ σ = 0.
If this is used in (3.191), the result is


dωβγ ∧ ηβγ α = d ωβγ ∧ ηβγ α


+ ωβγ ∧ −ωβσ ∧ ησ γ α − ωγσ ∧ ηβσ α + ωσα ∧ ηβγ σ .
If we add the contribution of the second term of (3.190) to this, we obtain the
identity

13 Remark (for readers familiar with connections in principal fiber bundles). The identity (3.192)
12 Using dg

and its derivation can be interpreted globally on the frame bundle, when ω is regarded as an
so(1, 3)-valued connection form and θ as the canonical Rn -valued 1-form (soldering form) [106].
In standard terminology (see [41, 42]), ∗tα is a pseudo-tensorial 3-form on the principal frame
bundle.

114

3

Einstein’s Field Equations

This implies the ‘conservation laws’
d(∗Tα + ∗tα ) = 0.

(3.195)

At first sight one might interpret ∗tα as energy and momentum 3-forms of the gravitational field. However, we know from the discussion in Sect. 3.4 that it is meaningless to talk about such concepts. This is reflected here by the fact that ∗tα does
not transform as a tensor with respect to gauge transformations. When ωβγ (x) = 0
(which can always be made to hold at some given point x), then ∗tα = 0. Conversely,
∗tα vanishes even in flat space only with respect to global Lorentz systems. A physical meaning can at best be assigned to integrals of ∗tα over spacelike hypersurfaces.
For isolated systems with asymptotically flat geometry, this is in fact the case, when
one chooses the reference frame {θ α } to be asymptotically Lorentzian.14
In order to define the total angular momentum in such cases, it is convenient to
use a conservation law of the form (3.195) so that tαβ (in tα = tαβ θ β ) is symmetric
with respect to a natural basis. Unfortunately, this is not the case for (3.193). For
this reason, we rewrite the Einstein equations in still another form.15
As a starting point we again take (3.163), and insert
ηαβγ = ηαβγ δ θδ .

(3.196)

Together with (3.190) this gives (the basis is not necessarily orthonormal)

− ηαβγ δ θδ ∧ dωβγ − ωαβ ∧ ωσγ = 8πG ∗ T α .

14 The use of pseudotensors appeared to many researchers in GR to violate the whole spirit of this

generally invariant theory, and criticism of Einstein’s conservation law was widespread (see, e.g.,
the discussions of Einstein with F. Klein, [77]). Einstein defended his point of view in detail in
[75]. Note that the three forms (3.193) exists globally if the spacetime manifold is parallelizable.
In (3.195) the sum ∗Tα + ∗tα is then a three form which is globally closed.

3.7.1 Interpretation
We consider an isolated system with asymptotically flat geometry. All coordinate
systems will be assumed to be asymptotically Lorentzian. Consider a spacelike hypersurface Σ which is non-singular and asymptotically flat (precisions will follow).
We interpret


Pα =

as the total (ADM) four-momentum and

√
−g ∗ M αβ
J αβ =

(3.208)

Σ

as the total (ADM) angular momentum of the isolated system. These quantities can
be decomposed according to (3.202) into contributions from matter and from the
gravitational field. The total four momentum P α and the total angular momentum
J αβ are constant in time if the gravitational fields fall off sufficiently fast at spacelike
infinity. (This will be described in detail later.)
We can use the field equations to express P α and J αβ in terms of twodimensional flux integrals. These will be considered as the appropriate definitions
of energy, momentum, and angular momentum at spacelike infinity.
If we integrate (3.199) over a three-dimensional spacelike region D3 ⊂ Σ , we
obtain

The region of integration must be extended over a “surface at infinity”. Note that
one obtains the same expression for the four-momentum from (3.194). We shall see
that (3.209) agrees with the original ADM four-momentum.
We now write the total angular momentum also as a flux integral. If we use the
field equations (in the form (3.199)) in (3.205), we obtain

(3.214)

Again, regard this as our primary definition of angular momentum at spacelike infinity.
P α and J αβ are gauge invariant in the following sense: Under a transformation
θ (x) −→ A(x)θ (x),
ω(x) −→ A(x)ω(x)A−1 (x) − dA(x)A−1 (x),

(3.215)

which reduces asymptotically to the identity, the flux integrals (3.209) and (3.214)
remain invariant. To see this we note that the homogeneous contributions to (3.215)
obviously do not change the flux integrals. The inhomogeneous term gives an additional surface integral of an exact differential, which vanishes by Stokes’ theorem.
Thus P α and J αβ transform tensorially under every transformation which leaves
the flat metric asymptotically invariant, since every such transformation can be represented as the product of a Lorentz transformation (with respect to which P α and
J αβ transform as tensors) and a transformation which reduces to the identity asymptotically.
In order to establish the connection with presentations found in other texts (for
example, [12]), we use the result of Exercise 3.20. This allows us to write the field

This shows that t αβ is a sum of terms quadratic in g̃ ,μ , with coefficients depending
only of the metric tensor (and its derivatives). The tedious, but straightforward part
of the calculation is to collect the many terms.
It is actually much simpler to derive the result by making use of Appendix B in
[6], see also Exercise 3.21.

3.7.2 ADM Expressions for Energy and Momentum
Before rewriting expression (3.209) solely in terms of data on Σ , we state more
precisely what we mean by asymptotic flatness of the hypersurface Σ , which we
assume to be complete16 to exclude singularities.
16 A pseudo-Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete if every maximal geodesic is defined
on the entire real line. For Riemannian manifolds there is another notion of completeness. Introduce the Riemannian distance d(p, q) between two points as the infimum of L(γ ) for all piecewise
smooth curve segments from p to q. This makes the manifold into a metric space whose topology
coincides with the original one. According to an important theorem of Hopf and Rinow, a Riemannian manifold is complete as a metric space if and only if it is geodesically complete. (Another
equivalent statement is that any closed bounded subset is compact.) For such a space each pair of
points can be connected by a geodesic. For proofs see, e.g., [48].

120

Einstein’s Field Equations

We assume that there is a compact set C ⊂ Σ such that the complement Σ \ C
is diffeomorphic to the complement of a contractible compact set in R3 . (More
generally, Σ \ C could be a disjoint union of a finite number of such sets.) Under
this diffeomorphism the metric on Σ \ C should be of the form
gij = δij + hij

(3.218)

in the standard coordinates of R3 , where hij = O(1/r), ∂k hij = O(1/r 2 ) and
∂l ∂k hij = O(1/r 3 ). Furthermore, the second fundamental form Kij of Σ ⊂ M
should satisfy Kij = O(1/r 2 ) and ∂k Kij = O(1/r 3 ).
Now, we rewrite (3.209), working with coordinates for which the asymptotic
conditions stated above are satisfied. If =

This is the standard ADM expression. We emphasize that (3.220) and (3.221) involve only the asymptotics of the induced metric and of the extrinsic curvature
on Σ. The integrals have to be understood, of course, as limits over two-surfaces
SR2 for R −→ ∞.

3.7.3 Positive Energy Theorem
What about the sign of the ADM energy? To answer this question we have to make
an general assumption about the energy-momentum tensor T which is satisfied for
“normal” matter.
Dominant energy condition For an arbitrary spacetime point p and for each timeμ
like vector ξ μ at p, Tμν ξ μ ξ ν ≥ 0, and T ν ξ ν is a non-spacelike vector.
For macroscopic matter this is a reasonable assumption, because it says that to
any observer the local energy density is non-negative and that the local energymomentum flow vector is non-spacelike. The dominant energy condition implies
that relative to any orthonormal basis
T 00 ≥ T μν ,

1/2

T 00 ≥ −T0i T 0i

(3.222)

(Exercise 3.22). Generically, T μ ν has, as a linear map, a timelike eigenvector. In
this case it is easy to show that T μν can be brought to diagonal form (T μν ) =
diag(ρ, p1 , p2 , p3 ), relative to an orthonormal basis.18 Then (3.222) implies ρ ≥ 0,
|pi | ≤ ρ.
Under the assumption that the dominant energy condition holds it has been shown
that the ADM four-momentum P μ is a future directed timelike or null vector. Furthermore, P μ = 0 if and only if spacetime is flat in a neighborhood of Σ .
This positive energy theorem says roughly: One cannot construct an object out of
“ordinary” matter, i.e., matter with positive local energy density, whose total energy
(including gravitational contributions) is negative.
The first proof of this important theorem was given by R. Schoen and S.T. Yau,
[110–113]. Later, E. Witten found a much simpler proof which makes crucial use of
18 Consider the following situation in linear algebra. Let (V , g) be a Minkowski vector space, T
a linear map of V which is symmetric, v1 , T v2  = T v1 , v2 , and assume that there is a timelike
eigenvector of T : T u = ρu. Let V ⊥ be the orthogonal complement of u in V . Then V splits into
the direct orthogonal sum V = Ru ⊕ V ⊥ . The symmetry of T implies that V ⊥ is invariant under T .
Restricted to V ⊥ , with the induced Euclidean metric, T is—since it is symmetric—diagonizable.

spinor fields (see [286]). Witten showed that it is possible to write with this tool the
four-momentum in such a way that the stated properties can be read off. We shall
give this proof in Chap. 9, where more will be said about the significance of the
positive energy theorem.

3.8 The Initial Value Problem of General Relativity
Mathematicians are like theologians: we regard existence as the prime attribute of what we
study. But unlike most theologians, we need not always rely upon faith alone.
—L.C. Evans19 (1998)

A study of the Cauchy problem in GR provides a deeper understanding of the structure of Einstein’s field equations. We give an introduction to the subject but discuss
only the local problem in some detail. Moreover, we shall avoid technicalities (use
of Sobolev spaces and all that). Our aim is to show that the local problem is conceptually very similar to the initial value problem in electrodynamics, although much
more difficult because of non-linearities.
In this section we shall make use of the fundamental equations for hypersurfaces
of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, developed in DG, Appendix A. Standard reviews
of the subject are [10], [107] and [108]. Global aspects are treated in the recent
monograph [109]. A useful source will be the proceedings of the Cargèse summer
school (2002) on the Cauchy problem in GR (see [125]).

3.8.1 Nature of the Problem
Recall that any spacelike hypersurface Σ of a Lorentz manifold (M, g) inherits a
Riemannian metric ḡ (the induced metric or first fundamental form) and the second
fundamental form K̄. The equations of Gauss and Codazzi–Mainardi show that certain components of the Einstein tensor for g are determined entirely by ḡ and K̄.
If Einstein’s vacuum equations hold (we shall discuss only this case) these components have to vanish. Conversely, these equations must be imposed as constraints
for the initial data of the Cauchy problem. These remarks lead us to some basic
definitions.
An initial data set is a triple (S, h, K), where (S, h) is a three-dimensional Riemannian manifold and K a covariant 2-tensor on S. A development of (S, h, K) is
a triple (M, g, σ ), where (M, g) is a Lorentz manifold and σ a diffeomorphism of
S onto a spacelike hypersurface Σ in M, such that the induced metric and the second fundamental form for Σ are the images of h and K under the diffeomorphism
σ : S −→ Σ. A different development (M  , g  , σ  ) is an extension of (M, g, σ ),
provided there exists an injective differentiable map φ : M −→ M  that transforms
g into g  and respects the images of S pointwise: σ  = φ ◦ σ (see Fig. 3.3). A map
which satisfies the latter property will be called admissible. Two developments are
equivalent if each one is an extension of the other, i.e., if there exists an admissible
diffeomorphism φ : M −→ M  with φ∗ g = g  . A special case would be two extensions (M, g, σ ) and (M, g  , σ ) with a diffeomorphism φ : M −→ M, which leaves
σ (S) pointwise invariant and transforms g into g  , i.e., g  = φ∗ g.
19 Quote from the textbook [57] by L.C. Evans on partial differential equations. We highly recommend this well written clear graduate text to all those who are eager to read a detailed modern
introduction to this vast field of mathematics.

125

Fig. 3.3 Extension of a
development (σ  = φ ◦ σ )

Fig. 3.4 Cauchy
hypersurface Σ . Past and
future directed causal curves
intersect Σ exactly once

The Cauchy problem concerns what we shall call E-developments, namely the existence and uniqueness (modulo equivalence) of a development (M, g, σ ) for initial
data (S, h, K) such that g satisfies Einstein’s vacuum equations. Of special interest
are developments for which Σ = σ (S) is a Cauchy surface of (M, g). By this we
mean that Σ is a spacelike hypersurface with the property that any non-spacelike
curve (causal curve) intersects Σ exactly once (see Fig. 3.4).
From now on it is always assumed that σ (S) is a Cauchy surface, if the contrary
is not explicitly said.

3.8.2 Constraint Equations
As already emphasized, an E-development (M, g, σ ) of (S, h, K) can only exist if
h and K satisfy certain constraints. These follow from
N μ Gμν = 0,

(3.227)

where N μ is the (future directed unit) normal to Σ = σ (S). Using DG, Eq. (A.21),
we can write Gμν N μ N ν = 0 as the following equation on S
R + (Tr K)2 − Tr(K · K) = 0,

(3.228)

126

3

Einstein’s Field Equations

where R is the Riemann scalar for the induced metric. The other components of
(3.227) give, according to (A.19),
∇ Tr(K) − ∇ · K = 0.

(3.229)

The constraint equations (3.228) and (3.229), called Hamiltonian constraint and
momentum constraint, respectively, are tensor equations on S. They are non-linear
elliptic partial differential equations for the initial data h and K.
There is an extended literature on these difficult constraint equations. Before we
discuss special types of solutions, it may be helpful to recall the role of constraints
in the Cauchy problem for electrodynamics in Minkowski spacetime.

3.8.3 Analogy with Electrodynamics
For simplicity, let us also consider the vacuum equations. As initial data at t = 0 we
cannot freely prescribe the electric and magnetic fields. These must be constrained
by the two Maxwell equations that do not contain time derivatives:
∇ · E = 0,

∇ · B = 0.

Beside these constraint equations we have the dynamical equations
∂t E − ∇ ∧ B = 0,

∂t B + ∇ ∧ E = 0.

(3.231)

A crucial point in the discussion of the Cauchy problem is that these guarantee
the propagation of the constraints (3.230); moreover, the Cauchy problem is wellposed (see Exercise 3.23). By this one means that (a) the problem has a solution,
(b) the solution is unique, and (c) the solution depends continuously on the data
given in the problem. Something similar happens in GR, as we shall see later.
For illustration, we discuss two special types of solutions of the constraint equations which make use of conformal techniques.
First we choose K = 0, so that σ (S) is totally geodesic (see DG, Appendix A).
We are then left with the geometrical problem of finding a Riemannian metric h on
S whose curvature scalar R vanishes.20 For this we make the following ansatz: Let
h̃ be any Riemannian metric on S and set
h = ϕ 4 h̃.

(3.232)

20 For a compact S this is a special case of the Yamabe problem: Show that on a compact Rieman-

nian manifold of dimension ≥ 3 there always exists a metric with constant scalar curvature. This
problem is solved, but for complete non-compact manifolds there are only a few results.

3.8 The Initial Value Problem of General Relativity

A straightforward calculation (see Exercise 3.24) shows that R = 0 is then equivalent to
1
Δ̃ϕ − R̃ϕ = 0,
(3.233)
8
where the tildes refer to the auxiliary metric h̃. In the special case when h̃ is chosen
to be flat, this reduces to Laplace’s equation in R3 .
Next, we generalize this to K = 0, but require that the mean curvature Tr(K)
vanishes (σ (S) is a maximal surface). Assume that we have solved the relatively
simple problem
∇˜ · K̃ = 0

(3.234)

for a symmetric traceless tensor K̃. If we then set
h = ϕ 4 h̃,

K=

1
K̃
ϕ2

it turns out (see Exercise 3.24) that
∇ · K = 0 (Tr K = 0),

(3.235)

and that the Hamiltonian constraint is satisfied if ϕ is a solution of the equation
1
1
Δ̃ϕ − R̃ϕ + ϕ −7 Tr(K̃ · K̃) = 0.

(3.236)

This equation has local solutions.

3.8.4 Propagation of Constraints
Let us assume that the six dynamical equations Rij = 0, for i = 1, 2, 3, are satisfied.
Then all Gαβ can be expressed linearly and homogeneously in terms of G0μ . To see
this note that
1
G00 = g 00 R00 ,
G0i = g 00 R0i ,
2
and use this in

1 
Gij = g i0 R0j − δ ij g 00 R00 + 2g 0k R0k ,
2
Gi0 = g i0 R00 + g ik R0k .
If we use this fact in the contracted Bianchi identity
0 = ∇α Gαβ = ∂0 G0β + ∂i Giβ − Γ σβα Gασ + Γ αασ Gσβ ,

128

3

Einstein’s Field Equations

we obtain a first order linear homogeneous system of partial differential equations
(PDE) for G0μ . Thus, if these components vanish at t = 0, they vanish also for
later times 0 ≤ t < t0 , at least for analytic data. Without analyticity we can not
refer to a known uniqueness theorem for this type of equations. Indeed, there are
simple counter examples for uniqueness of such linear systems of PDE.21 However,
the propagation of the constraints can rigorously be proved with the existence and
uniqueness theorems discussed below.

3.8.5 Local Existence and Uniqueness Theorems
The classical approach to establish local existence and uniqueness theorems in GR
makes crucial use of the fact that for harmonic gauge conditions the Einstein equations become a strictly hyperbolic system for which mathematical theorems can
be applied. A second equally important fact is that it suffices to solve the Cauchy
problem for this reduced equation, because it guarantees that the harmonic gauge
condition propagates. If it is imposed on the initial surface—together with the constraint equations—it holds also for later times. Hence, the Einstein equations are
also satisfied.

3.8.6 Analogy with Electrodynamics
Since the situation in electrodynamics is conceptually very analogous, we consider this first. This time we work with the gauge potential Aμ , in terms of which
Maxwell’s equations are
Gν := ∂ μ (∂μ Aν − ∂ν Aμ ) = 0.

(3.237)

A first observation is that G0 = 0 contains no second time derivatives:
∂ i (∂i A0 − ∂t Ai ) = 0.

(3.238)

This equation says that the divergence of the electric field vanishes. It has to be imposed on the initial data Aμ , ∂t Aμ at t = 0. The remaining three spatial components
of Maxwell’s equations (3.237) do not give rise to a well-posed initial value problem
for the four potentials Aμ . Clearly, this is due to gauge invariance.
21 For example, there exist functions a(t, x) and u(t, x) in C ∞ (R2 , C) with supports in {(x, t) ∈

R2 : t > 0}, such that
∂t u + a∂x u = 0,
but do not vanish everywhere. Such an u and u ≡ 0 are both solutions with the initial condition
u = 0.

3.8 The Initial Value Problem of General Relativity

129

The standard procedure is to restrict the gauge freedom by imposing a gauge condition. Because the analogue of the harmonic gauge condition in GR is the Lorentz
gauge condition
Γ := ∂ μ Aμ = 0,

(3.239)

we impose this and get from (3.237) the ‘reduced equation’
(L)

Gμ := Aμ = 0.

(3.240)

For an arbitrary gauge we have the identity
Gμ = (L) Gμ − ∂μ Γ.

(3.241)

Equation (3.240) has an initial value formulation with an existence and uniqueness
theorem, given the initial data (Aμ , ∂t Aμ ).
If we impose on these data the Lorentz condition it propagates as a result of
(3.240), if the constraint (3.238), i.e., G0 = 0 is satisfied for the initial data. Indeed,
(3.240) implies that Γ satisfies the wave equation. Beside Γ = 0 for t = 0, we also
have ∂t Γ = 0 at t = 0, because this is equivalent to (3.238) if equation (3.240) is
satisfied:
∂t Γ = ∂t2 A0 + ∂ i ∂t Ai
= −∂ i ∂i A0 + ∂ i ∂t Ai = −∇ · E.
Summarizing, a solution of the ‘reduced’ hyperbolic equation (3.240) for which
the initial data (Aμ , ∂t Aμ ) satisfy the constraint ∇ · E = 0 and the Lorentz condition
Γ = 0, solves the Maxwell equations and the Lorentz condition. Furthermore, one
obtains in this way all solutions of Maxwell’s equations, up to gauge transformations. This is clear from the formulation of the Cauchy problem in terms of E and
B, as described earlier (see Exercise 3.23). In terms of the gauge potential we can
argue as follows.
Given a solution Aμ of Maxwell’s equations (3.237) in any gauge, we can find a
gauge transformation
Aμ −→ (L) Aμ = Aμ + ∂μ χ
such that (L) Aμ satisfies the Lorentz condition, by solving the inhomogeneous wave
equation
χ = −∂ μ Aμ .
(L) A solves the reduced equation (3.240), and satisfies initially the constraint
μ

(3.238) as well as the Lorentz condition Γ = 0, and is thus one of the solutions
considered above.

Einstein’s Field Equations

3.8.7 Harmonic Gauge Condition
In GR we proceed along the same line of reasoning. We begin by discussing the
harmonic gauge condition. (This was used from the very beginning of GR. We now
know that Einstein introduced it already in 1912 in his Zürich research notes, when
he studied the Ricci tensor; see [61].)
The harmonic gauge condition is defined as the requirement that the coordinate
functions x μ are harmonic:
√

1
x μ = √ ∂ν −gg μν = 0.
−g

(3.242)

This can be written differently. Consider
Γ α := g μν Γ αμν .

(3.243)

Inserting the explicit expressions for the Christoffel symbols, one easily finds
1
Γ α = −∂μ g μα − g αβ g μν ∂β gμν ,
2

(3.244)

Γ α = −x α .

(3.245)

thus

Therefore, (3.242) is equivalent to the gauge condition
Γ α = 0.

(3.246)

3.8.8 Field Equations in Harmonic Gauge
From now on we work on an open set M ⊂ R4 since our considerations are local.
The initial surface Σ is taken to be {x 0 = 0}.
As a preparation we write out explicitly the second order derivatives of the Ricci
tensor
β

Rμν = ∂α Γ αμν − ∂μ Γ ανα + Γ αμν Γ αβ − Γ βμα Γ ανβ .

(3.247)

These are contained in the first two terms and also, as one easily verifies, in the
expression

1
1
− g αβ ∂α ∂β gμν + gαμ ∂ν Γ α + gαν ∂μ Γ α .
2
2
So, in an arbitrary coordinate system
Rμν = (h) Rμν +


1
gαμ ∂ν Γ α + gαν ∂μ Γ α ,

(3.248)

with
1
Rμν = − g αβ ∂α ∂β gμν + Hμν (g, ∂g).
(3.249)
2
Here, Hμν (g, ∂g) is a rational expression of gμν and ∂α gμν with denominator
det(gμν ) = 0. (By Cramer’s formula g μν is a rational combination of gμν with denominator det(gμν ).) Clearly, Rμν = (h) Rμν in a harmonic gauge Γ α = 0.
For the Einstein tensor we obtain from (3.248)
(h)

Gμν = (h) Gμν +

(3.250)

with
(h)

1
Gμν = (h) Rμν − gμν (h) R,
2

(h)

R = (h) R λλ .

(3.251)

The highest derivative operator − 12 g αβ ∂α ∂β in (3.249) acts the same way on each
component of the system gμν (no mixing of highest order derivatives). The reduced
system
(h)

Rμν = 0,

(3.252)

i.e., Einstein’s field equations in harmonic gauge, is in standard terminology (see
[57]), a quasilinear hyperbolic system. The highest derivative in (3.252) is the same
as for the wave equation of a scalar field. It is of crucial importance that such a
system has for smooth initial data gμν (0, x i ) and ∂0 gμν (0, x i ), locally a unique
smooth solution. For the relevant theorems,22 see [107]. The domain of dependence
is the same as for the wave equation with metric gμν .
Next, we show that it suffices to solve the well-posed Cauchy problem for the
reduced system (3.252), because it will turn out that for special initial conditions
the gauge condition Γ α = 0 is then automatically satisfied. To this end we first
derive a linear wave equation for Γ α . This is obtained by inserting (3.250) into the
Bianchi identity. For solutions of (3.252) we find


1
0 = ∇ μ Gμν = g ρμ ∇ρ gμα ∂ν Γ α + gνα ∂μ Γ α − gμν ∂α Γ α
2
1
= gαν g ρμ ∂ρ ∂μ Γ α + lower order terms in Γ α ,
2
thus,
μ
g μν ∂μ ∂ν Γ α + Aαν
μ (g, ∂g)∂ν Γ = 0.

(3.253)

22 Physicists usually do not care about such theorems, because they take the result for granted. As a
warning, we mention that there are even linear PDE without singular points that have no solution
anywhere. A famous example was constructed by H. Lewy that also highlights the importance of
analyticity in the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem (see Chap. 8 of [58]).

132

3

Einstein’s Field Equations

For this system of linear hyperbolic PDE one again has an existence and uniqueness
theorem (see [107]). Hence Γ α (0, x i ) = 0 and ∂0 Γ α (0, x i ) = 0 imply Γ α (x μ ) = 0.
The next point is to show that the constraint equations Gμ0 = 0, that necessarily
have to be imposed at t = 0, imply ∂0 Γ α (0, x i ) = 0, while Γ α (0, x i ) = 0 is compatible with them.
That the harmonic condition at t = 0 is compatible with the constraints is not
surprising, because the latter have a geometrical meaning, while the former is a coordinate condition. In Exercise 3.25 we shall verify that the derivatives ∂0 g0μ (0, x i )
can indeed be chosen such that Γ α (0, x i ) = 0.
From (3.250) we see that for a solution of the reduced system (3.252) the constraint equations imply that at t = 0


g0α ∂ν Γ α + gνα ∂0 Γ α − g0ν ∂α Γ α = 0.
(3.254)
Let us work this out for Gaussian normal coordinates23 relative to t = 0, for which
(see DG, Eq. (A.23))






g00 0, x k = −1,
g0j 0, x k = 0,
∂0 gij 0, x k = −2Kij .
(3.255)
Imposing also Γ α (0, x k ) = 0, Eq. (3.254) becomes gνα ∂0 Γ α = 0, thus indeed
∂0 Γ α (0, x i ) = 0.
Let us summarize what has been shown so far:
0 and k 0 be smooth initial conditions at t = 0 in a bounded
Theorem 3.3 Let gμν

Moreover, this metric also satisfies the vacuum equations Rμν = 0, as well as
Γ α = 0.
Remarks

1. One can also show that gμν depends continuously on (gμν

natural topology.
2. We can choose the coordinates such that (3.255) holds at t = 0.

Next we prove that we obtain in this way locally all solutions of Einstein’s vacuum equations.
Theorem 3.4 Any solution of Einstein’s vacuum equation is locally diffeomorphic
to a solution described in Theorem 3.3. More specifically, let g be a solution on
23 Gaussian normal coordinates are introduced in Sect. 3.9.3.

3.8 The Initial Value Problem of General Relativity

133

an open region U ⊂ R4 and Σ = U ∩ {x 0 = 0}. (After an eventual coordinate shift
Σ is non empty.) Then there exists a diffeomorphism ϕ from a strip |x 0 | < ε in U
preserving the points with x 0 = 0, such that the standard coordinate functions x μ
of R4 are harmonic for the metric g̃ := ϕ∗ g, and g̃00 = −1, g̃0i = 0 for x 0 = 0.
Proof The construction of ϕ proceeds as follows. Let f α be four functions on such
a strip which are harmonic relative to the metric g,
g f α = δg ◦ df α = 0,

(3.256)

where δg is the codifferential corresponding to g. We solve these wave equations
for the initial data




f i 0, x j = x i ,
f 0 0, x j = 0,
and



∂0 f α 0, x j = ξ α ,

(3.257)

where
gαi ξ α = 0,

gαβ ξ α ξ β = −1.

(3.258)

Clearly, the differentials df α are linearly independent for a sufficiently small
strip U  .
Now, we define ϕ : U  −→ V  by x μ ◦ ϕ = f μ , where x μ are the standard coordinate functions of R4 (in other words, ϕ(x)μ = f μ (x)). For showing that
 
(3.259)
ϕ∗ g x μ = 0,
we use the general fact that for a differential form ω, and a diffeomorphism ϕ :
M −→ M, one has the natural transformation rule (exercise)
δϕ∗ g (ϕ∗ ω) = ϕ∗ (δg ω),

(3.260)

ϕ∗ g (ϕ∗ ω) = ϕ∗ (g ω).

(3.261)

and thus

With this we have
 

 
 

ϕ∗ g x μ = ϕ∗ g ϕ∗ ◦ ϕ ∗ x μ = ϕ∗ g ϕ∗ x μ ◦ ϕ




= ϕ∗ g ϕ∗ f μ = ϕ∗ g f μ = 0.
This shows that ϕ∗ g belongs to the solutions described in Theorem 3.3. By construction ϕ|S = id.

Remark After a suitable transformation of the original metric g, we can always
assume that (3.255) holds on Σ . Then ϕ preserves Σ pointwise and by (3.257),
(3.258) its induced metric and second fundamental form.

Einstein’s Field Equations

Theorem 3.4 and the uniqueness statement in Theorem 3.3 imply the
Corollary 3.1 E-developments of (S, h, k) are locally unique: Two E-developments
are extensions of a common development.
Proof If (U1 , g (1) ) and (U2 , g (2) ), Ui ⊂ R4 , are two such developments, we can
choose local coordinates such that both Σi ∩ Ui are contained in {x 0 = 0}. For
each of the E-developments construct a diffeomorphism as in the remark above.
The images of g (1) and g (2) agree by the uniqueness result of Theorem 3.3. This
implies that there is an isometry between the two E-developments, if U1 and U2 are
appropriately reduced, which respects the initial surfaces Σ1 and Σ2 .

Let us translate these results into geometrical statements.
Theorem 3.5 (Local existence and uniqueness) Let (S, h, K) be an initial data
set which satisfies the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints (3.228) and (3.229).
Then there exists an E-development (M, g, σ ). Two such E-developments are extensions of the same E-development.
Proof By Theorem 3.3 we can construct an atlas of S with domains {Vi } and Edevelopments (Ui , g (i) , σi ) of (Vi , h, K). On an intersection Ui ∩ Uj the Corollary
implies that there is an isometry ψij that takes g (i) into g (j ) , if Ui and Uj are suitable
reduced. Therefore, we can patch the local solutions together: Consider the disjoint
union of the (Ui , g (i) ) and identify points pi ∈ Ui and pj ∈ Uj when pj = ψij (pi ).
This proves the existence part.
The uniqueness follows from the local uniqueness (Corollary) by making use of
an atlas for S. We leave the details to the reader.

The existence of a maximal development now follows with Zorn’s lemma.
Theorem 3.6 (Global uniqueness) Under the hypothesis of Theorem 3.5 there is a
maximal E-development which is unique, up to isometries.
Proof See, e.g., [108].



Note that for uniqueness it is important that the hypersurface Σ is a Cauchy
surface. (Recall that we included this property in the definition of a development.)
A spacetime which admits a Cauchy surface Σ is globally hyperbolic. One can show
that it is then diffeomorphic to the product R × Σ.
It is nice to have this general existence theorem, but it does not tell us much about
the global aspects of solutions of Einstein’s field equation. A major result in this
direction was established by D. Christodoulou and S. Klainermann in 1993, [115].
This work, which gave a proof of the global stability of Minkowski spacetime, is
revisited in the recent monograph [109].

3.8 The Initial Value Problem of General Relativity

3.8.9 Characteristics of Einstein’s Field Equations
The notion of characteristic surfaces is closely linked with the Cauchy problem of
PDE. Let us explain this concept for the wave equation
g ψ = 0,

(3.262)

g μν ∂μ ∂ν ψ − Γ α ∂α ψ = 0.

(3.263)

whose explicit form is

The Cauchy problem for this equation is to find a solution for which the value of ψ
and its normal derivative on a hypersurface Σ are given.
This problem does not have a unique solution if Σ is chosen such that (3.263)
does not determine the second derivatives of ψ on Σ for given Cauchy data. In this
case, the hypersurface Σ is said to be a characteristic surface, or a characteristic of
the PDE (3.263). The second derivative can be discontinuous across a characteristic
surface. For this reason, a (moving) wave front must be a characteristic.
It is not difficult to show that Σ is a non-characteristic for the PDE (3.263),
provided
gμν N μ N ν = 0,

(3.264)

where N μ denotes the unit normal to Σ. If Σ is a non-characteristic one can show
that for a smooth solution ψ satisfying the Cauchy conditions, all partial derivatives
of ψ on Σ are determined. (The details of the calculations for general quasi linear
PDE can be found in [57].)
If Σ is described as {S = 0} for a function S, with dS = 0 on Σ , then (3.264)
becomes24
g μν ∂μ S∂ν S = 0.

(3.265)

In other words, characteristic surfaces are null hypersurfaces; S satisfies the general
relativistic eikonal equation (Hamilton–Jacobi equation)
g μν ∂μ S∂ν S = 0,

(3.266)

which we encountered in the study of the geometrical optics limit in Sect. 2.8. These
surfaces describe for instance the wave fronts in gravitational lensing.
What are the characteristic surfaces of Einstein’s vacuum equations? With our
previous results this can easily be answered. We know that the field equations are
equivalent to the pair (3.252) and (3.253). For both of them the highest derivative
24 For a simple proof of (3.265) chose the function S as one of the coordinates, say x 1 . Along Σ

the left-hand side of (3.263) has the form g 11 ∂12 ψ + terms which are all determined by the Cauchy
data on Σ (since these involve tangential derivatives of ψ and ∇ψ on Σ ). Hence, ∂12 ψ is only
determined by the Cauchy data and the differential equation (3.263) if g 11 = 0, that is if (3.265)
holds.

operator is the same as for the wave equation (3.263). Therefore, the characteristic
surfaces in GR are, as expected, null hypersurfaces.

the left-hand sides of (3.231) satisfy all Maxwell equations (by construction)

3.9.1 Generalities
We assume that a spacetime (M, g) admits a slicing by a 1-parameter family Σt of
spacelike hypersurfaces. More precisely, we assume that there is a diffeomorphism
φ : M −→ I × Σ , I ⊂ R, such that the manifolds Σt = φ −1 ({t} × Σ) =: it (Σ)
are spacelike and the curves φ −1 (I × {x}) are timelike. These curves will be called
preferred timelike orbits. Their tangent vectors define a vector field ∂t on M. This
can be decomposed into normal and parallel components relative to the slicing (see

∂t = αn + β̄.

(3.271)

Here n is the future directed unit normal field with n, n = −1 and β̄ is tangent
to the slices Σt . It is common practice to call α the lapse function and β̄ the shift
vector field. A coordinate system {x i } on Σ induces natural (comoving) coordinates
on M: φ −1 (t, m) has coordinates (t, x i ) if m ∈ Σ has coordinates x i . The preferred
timelike curves have constant spatial coordinates.
Let us set β̄ = β i ∂i . From n, ∂i  = 0 and (3.271) we find

∂t , ∂i  = βi ,
∂t , ∂t  = − α 2 − β i βi ,
(3.272)
where βi = gij β j and gij = ∂i , ∂j  are the components of the induced metric on
Σt . Thus in what we could also call comoving coordinates the metric takes the form

This shows that dt is orthogonal to dx i + β i dt, for i = 1, 2, 3.
We call a tensor field S on M tangential when it can be regarded as a family
of tensor fields on Σt , or as a t-dependent tensor field on the ‘absolute’ space Σ.
Relative to a comoving coordinate system it has the form

(For each t the values of S are in tensor products of T Σt and T ∗ Σt .) We shall
denote them by bars (except for dx i and ∂i ). As an often occurring example, let us
consider a tangential p-form ω̄ and its exterior derivative d ω̄. We can decompose
this as
d ω̄ = d̄ ω̄ + dt ∧ ∂t ω̄,

(3.276)

where d̄ denotes the exterior derivative in Σt (d̄ = dx i ∧ ∂i in comoving coordinates), and ∂t ω̄ is the partial time derivative. Both d̄ ω̄ and ∂t ω̄ are, of course, tangential. Other differential operators (covariant derivative, Lie derivative, etc.) can be
decomposed similarly.
Beside the dual pair {∂μ } and {dx μ } for comoving coordinates, we also use the
dual pair


{∂i , n} and dx i + β i dt, α dt .
(3.277)
For our computations it is often convenient to use instead of {∂i } an orthonormal
triad of tangential vector fields {ēi }, together with the dual basis {ϑ̄ i } instead of
dx i . Then we have the following two dual pairs which will be constantly used

∂t ḡ = −2α K̄ + L̄β̄ ḡ.

(3.309)

The system (3.308) and (3.309) are the dynamical equations for ḡ and K̄. They
contain the lapse function α and the shift vector β which have to be fixed by four
gauge conditions.
The simplest choice α = 1 and β̄ = 0 corresponds to Gaussian normal coordinates that are often useful.

3.9.4 Gaussian Normal Coordinates
Close to a spacelike (or timelike) hypersurface Σ ⊂ M we can introduce so called
Gaussian normal coordinates as follows. Let N be as before a field of unit normals
on Σ near a point p ∈ Σ. Construct through each point q ∈ Σ the geodesic through
q tangent to N and assign to a point along such a geodesic as time coordinate t
the proper time (t = 0 on Σ), and as spatial coordinates those of the point q of a
coordinate system of Σ in a neighborhood of p. For sufficiently small |t| we obtain
in this way a coordinate system of M in a neighborhood of p (see Fig. 3.6).
We claim that the hypersurfaces Σt near Σ with constant t are orthogonal to
the geodesics leaving Σ orthogonally (Gauss’ Lemma). We emphasize that this is
a local result; distinct geodesics can meet at some distance from Σ (coordinate
singularity).
For a proof of Gauss’ Lemma, consider a 1-parameter family cε of our congru1 + ε, and
ence of timelike geodesics, with constant coordinates x 2 , x 3 and x 1 = x(0)
apply the first variation formula of DG, Sect. 16.3. If Y denotes the variation vector

 t0

Since the length is constant (equal to t0 ), and Y at c(0) is tangent to Σ , thus orthogonal to ċ(0), we obtain with ∇ċ ċ = 0
Y, ċ = 0
for all t. Hence, every ċ is orthogonal to ∂/∂x 1 , and similarly to all ∂/∂x i . This
proves the lemma.
Since ∂t , ∂t  = −1 and ∂t , ∂i  = 0, the metric has in Gaussian normal coordinates the form
 
g = −dt 2 + gik x μ dx i dx k ,
(3.310)
thus α = 1 and β̄ = 0. We emphasize once more that this slicing usually develops
caustics (coordinate singularities).

3.9.5 Maximal Slicing
A traditional condition for the lapse results by requiring maximal slicing: H ≡
Tr(K̄) = 0. For vacuum solutions this condition, originally proposed by Lichnerowicz, implies the elliptic equation
Δ̄α = α Tr(K̄ · K̄)

(3.311)

(see (3.306a)). It has the advantage that it decouples.
Imposing successful choices for lapse and shift for numerical relativity is a difficult problem that is still under study. Mathematically, not much is known about the
evolution equations in the form (3.308) and (3.309), because they are not hyperbolic
in the sense of any known definition.
Remark The ADM system of evolutionary equations has traditionally been used in
3D numerical relativity. It turned out, however, that this system is not ideal. Severe
instabilities often show up in numerical simulations. There is no good understanding
of this, but it is true that the ADM evolutionary equations do not satisfy any known
hyperbolicity condition. This situation prompted attempts for developing alternative
formulations of Einstein’s equations. Among these there are various hyperbolicity
formulations (see [119–124]).
Eventually, it turned out that a simple way of rewriting the traditional ADM form
(3.308), (3.309) of the evolutionary equations leads to remarkably stable numerical
evolution. In this formulation (see [116]) one separates out the conformal degrees
of freedom of the 3-metric ḡ and the trace-free part of the second fundamental

3.10

form. In addition, the quantities (3.243) for ḡ are promoted to independent variables,
for which a first order evolutionary equation is derived. (For details, the reader is
referred to [117], and the textbooks [19, 20].) That this ‘conformal approach’ leads
to more stable evolutions has been demonstrated in a number of simulations (see,
e.g., [118]).

3.10 Domain of Dependence and Propagation of Matter
Disturbances
In this section we prove the following general fact. Assume that the energymomentum tensor T μν satisfies, beside T μν ;ν = 0, the dominant energy condition.
Suppose that T μν vanishes on a compact part S of a spacelike hypersurface. Then
T μν vanishes in the domain of dependence D + (S), defined as the set of all points p
of spacetime such that every past-inextensible non-spacelike curve through p intersects S. In other words, the dominant energy condition implies that matter can not
move faster than light into an empty region. It is remarkable that this follows from
4 equations for the 10 components of T μν .
In order to prove this26 we consider for a point q ∈ D + (S) the region U in D + (S)
to the past of q. One can show that this is compact (see Proposition 6.6.6 of [10]).
Consider a foliation by a time function t (whose gradient is everywhere timelike).
Then T μν t;μ t;ν ≥ 0, and X μ := T μν t;ν is non-spacelike and future directed. Therefore, the integral

T μν t;μ t;ν η

ϕ(t) :=
Ut

26 We adapt the proof in Sect. 4.3 of [10].

is non-negative. Here, Ut denotes the region of U at times ≤ t. The integrand is
equal to
dt, Xη = dt ∧ iX η.
Hence, using the Fubini theorem for manifolds,27 we obtain

∂ Ut

Σ t ∩U

By assumption, T μν = 0 on the initial surface. The rest of the boundary terms not
written out give a positive contribution, as a result of the dominant energy condition.
To show this, we use the following fact for a domain D with boundary ∂D (equipped
with the standard induced orientation):
iX η|∂D = εX ρX ,

(3.315)

where ρX is a positive density (DG, Sect. 15.11), and εX (x) = 1(−1) if X(x) points
out (into) D, and εX (x) = 0 if X(x) is tangent to ∂D. The reader may prove this
as an exercise or consult p. 447 of [56]. Because X is non-spacelike and future
directed, it points out of the domain (εX = 1) or is tangential (εX = 0) on the parts
of the boundary under discussion. So the additional boundary contribution is nonnegative, hence we know that


iX η ≤
diX η.
Σ t ∩U

Here, the integrand on the right is
diX η = (∇ · X)η = T μν t;μν .
Since U is compact there is a P > 0 such that
T μν t;μν ≤ P T μν t;μ t;ν
on U . Therefore, we obtain with (3.314) the inequality
dϕ
≤ P ϕ(t).

Boltzmann Equation in GR

149

Because ϕ vanishes on the initial surface S, the Gronwall inequality implies ϕ(t) ≤
0, hence ϕ ≡ 0 on U . If the dominant energy condition is satisfied, this is only
possible if T μν = 0 on U (use (3.222)).

3.11 Boltzmann Equation in GR
In relativistic astrophysics and cosmology one often has to use a general relativistic
version of the Boltzmann equation. Important examples are: (1) Neutrino transport
in gravitational collapse. (2) Description of photons and neutrinos before the recombination era in cosmology, when a fluid description no more suffices. In this
section we give a general introduction to this kinetic theory. References to concrete
applications will be given later.

3.11.1 One-Particle Phase Space, Liouville Operator for Geodesic
Spray
For what follows we first have to develop some kinematic and differential geometric
tools. Our goal is to generalize the standard description of Boltzmann in terms of
one-particle distribution functions.
Let g#be the metric of the spacetime manifold M. On the cotangent bundle
T ∗ M = p∈M Tp∗ M we have the natural symplectic 2-form ω, which is given in
natural bundle coordinates28 (x μ , pν ) by
ω = dx μ ∧ dpμ .

(3.316)

(For an intrinsic description, see Chap. 6 of [60].) So far no metric is needed. The
pair (T ∗ M, ω) is always a symplectic manifold.
The metric g defines a natural diffeomorphism between the tangent bundle T M
and T ∗ M which can be used to pull ω back to a symplectic form ωg on T M. In
natural bundle coordinates the diffeomorphism is given by (x μ , p α ) → (x μ , pα =
gαβ p β ), hence


ωg = dx μ ∧ d gμν p ν .
(3.317)
On T M we can consider the “Hamiltonian function”
1
L = gμν p μ p ν
2

(3.318)

28 If x μ are coordinates of M then the dx μ form in each point p ∈ M a basis of the cotangent

space Tp∗ M. The bundle coordinates of β ∈ Tp∗ M are then (x μ , βν ) if β = βν dx ν and x μ are the
coordinates of p. With such bundle coordinates one can define an atlas, by which T ∗ M becomes a
differentiable manifold.

The geodesic flow is the flow of the vector field Xg .
Let Ωωg be the volume form belonging to ωg , i.e., the Liouville volume
Ωωg = const ωg ∧ · · · ∧ ωg ,
or (g = det(gαβ ))
 


Ωωg = (−g) dx 0 ∧ dx 1 ∧ dx 2 ∧ dx 3 ∧ dp 0 ∧ dp 1 ∧ dp 2 ∧ dp 3
≡ (−g)dx 0123 ∧ dp 0123 .

(3.323)

The one-particle phase space for particles of mass m is the following submanifold of T M:


Φm = v ∈ T M | v future directed, g(v, v) = −m2 .

(3.324)

This is invariant under the geodesic flow. The restriction of Xg to Φm will also be
denoted by Xg . Ωωg induces a volume form Ωm (see below) on Φm , which is also
invariant under Xg :
LXg Ωm = 0.

(3.325)

Ωm is determined as follows (known from Hamiltonian mechanics): Write Ωωg in
the form
Ωωg = −dL ∧ σ,
(this is always possible, but σ is not unique), then Ωm is the pull-back of Ωωg by
the injection i : Φm → T M,
Ωm = i ∗ σ.

(3.326)

While σ is not unique (one can, for instance, add a multiple of dL), the form Ωm is
independent of the choice of σ (show this). In natural bundle coordinates a possible
choice is
σ = (−g) dx 0123 ∧

dp 123

(−p0 )

because
−dL ∧ σ = −gμν p μ dp ν + · · · ∧ σ = (−g) dx 0123 ∧ gμ0 p μ dp 0 ∧

Hence,

with p 0 > 0, and gμν p μ p ν = −m2 .
We shall need some additional tools. Let Σ be a hypersurface of Φm transversal
to Xg . On Σ we can use the volume form
volΣ = iXg Ωm |Σ.

(3.330)

ωm := iXg Ωm

(3.331)

dωm = 0,

(3.332)

Now we note that the 6-form

on Φm is closed,

because
dωm = diXg Ωm = LXg Ωm = 0
(we used dΩm = 0 and (3.325)). From (3.327) we obtain
ωm = (iXg η) ∧ Πm + η ∧ iXg Πm .

(3.333)

In the special case when Σ is a “time section”, i.e., in the inverse image of a
spacelike submanifold of M under the natural projection Φm → M, then the second
term in (3.333) vanishes on Σ, while the first term is on Σ according to (3.320)

Indeed, because of (3.332) the left-hand side of this equation is

Now, let D be a domain in Φm which is the inverse of a domain D̄ ⊂ M under

3.11.2 The General Relativistic Boltzmann Equation
Let us first consider particles for which collisions can be neglected (e.g. neutrinos
at temperatures much below 1 MeV). Then the conservation of the particle number
in a domain that is comoving with the flow φs of Xg means that the integrals

f ωm ,
φs (Σ)

Σ as before a hypersurface of Φm transversal to Xg , are independent of s. We now
show that this implies the collisionless Boltzmann equation
LXg f = 0.

(3.341)

The proof of this expected result proceeds as follows. Consider a ‘cylinder’ G,
sweeping by Σ under the flow φs in the interval [0, s] (see Fig. 3.7), and the integral


LX g f Ω m =
f ωm
G

∂G

(we used Eq. (3.338)). Since iXg ωm = iXg (iXg Ωm ) = 0, the integral over the mantle
of the cylinder vanishes, while those over Σ and φs (Σ) cancel (conservation of
particles). Because Σ and s are arbitrary, we conclude that (3.341) must hold.
From (3.337) and (3.338) we obtain, as expected, the conservation of the particle
number current density: nμ ;μ = 0.

With collisions, the Boltzmann equation has the symbolic form
LXg f = C[f ],

The Schwarzschild Solution and Classical Tests
of General Relativity

Imagine my joy at the feasibility of general covariance and the result that the equations give
the perihelion motion of Mercury correctly. For a few days I was beside myself with joyous
excitement.
—A. Einstein
(To P. Ehrenfest, Jan. 17, 1916)

The solution of the field equations, which describes the field outside of a spherically symmetric mass distribution, was found by Karl Schwarzschild only two
months after Einstein published his field equations. Schwarzschild performed this
work under rather unusual conditions. In the spring and summer of 1915 he was assigned to the eastern front. There he came down with an infectious disease and in the
fall of 1915 he returned seriously ill to Germany. He died only a few months later,
on May 11, 1916. In this short time, he wrote two significant papers, in spite of his
illness. One of these dealt with the Stark effect in the Bohr–Sommerfeld theory, and
the other solved the Einstein field equations for a static, spherically symmetric field.
From this solution he derived the precession of the perihelion of Mercury and the
bending of light rays near the sun. Einstein had calculated these effects previously
by solving the field equations in post-Newtonian approximation.

4.1 Derivation of the Schwarzschild Solution
The Schwarzschild solution is the unique static, spherically symmetric vacuum
spacetime and describes the field outside a spherically symmetric body. It is the
most important exact solution of Einstein’s field equations.
We know that a static spacetime (M, g) has locally the form (see Sect. 2.9)
M = R × Σ,

g = −ϕ 2 dt 2 + h,

(4.1)

where h is a Riemannian metric on Σ and ϕ is a smooth function on Σ . The timelike
Killing field K with respect to which (M, g) is static is ∂t . We assume that this is
the only static Killing field and thus that there is a distinguished time. Note also that
ϕ 2 = −K, K.

4 The Schwarzschild Solution and Classical Tests of General Relativity

Fig. 4.1 Construction of
Schwarzschild coordinates

We say that a Lorentz manifold is spherically symmetric, provided it admits the
group SO(3) as an isometry group, in such a way that the group orbits, i.e., the subsets on which the group acts transitively, are two-dimensional spacelike surfaces. If
(4.1) is also spherically symmetric, the action of SO(3) is only non-trivial on Σ ,
i.e., the time t is preserved. This follows from the fact that K = ∂t is invariant under SO(3) (because of the uniqueness assumption). Indeed, this implies that K is
perpendicular to the orbits of SO(3). (A non-vanishing orthogonal projection of K
on an orbit would also be invariant, but such an invariant vector field can not exist.)
Another way to see that t remains invariant is to note that the 1-form ω = K, K dt
belonging to K (see Eq. (2.114)) is also invariant. Since K, K is obviously invariant we conclude that dt remains invariant under the SO(3) action. But since SO(3)
is connected this implies that t is preserved.
We now consider the isometric action of SO(3) on (Σ, h). An orbit is a homogeneous two-dimensional Riemannian manifold S and therefore has constant Gaussian
curvature k and is complete. √
It is known1 that the standard simply connected surface
M(k) (2-sphere of radius 1/ k for k > 0, hyperbolic plane of curvature k < 0, Euclidean plane for k = 0) is a Riemannian covering of S. By this one means that there
is a covering map which is also a local isometry. Since the isometry group of S includes SO(3), k must be positive
and there are only two possibilities
√
√ for S: Either S
is the 2-sphere of radius 1/ k or the projective plane of radius 1/ k (obtained from
the 2-sphere by identifying antipodal points). Considering—for good reasons—only
the first possibility we have a foliation of (Σ, h) by invariant 2-spheres, characterized by the surface area A. The radial Schwarzschild coordinate r is defined by
A = 4πr 2 . We assume that dr = 0.
Let us now consider the family of geodesics orthogonal to some particular 2sphere (see Fig. 4.1), for which we introduce polar coordinates and transport these
with the family of geodesics. We leave it as an exercise to show that this family is
orthogonal to all SO(3) orbits. (Consider, for instance, the scalar product of a Killing

field ξ for the SO(3) action with the tangent field u for the geodesic congruence, and
show that uξ, u = 0.) With this construction the metric h takes the form


h = e2b(r) dr 2 + r 2 dϑ 2 + sin2 ϑ dϕ 2 .
(4.2)
Clearly, K, K also depends only on r. Setting −K, K = e2a(r) , Eq. (4.1) takes
the form Σ = I × S 2 , where I is an interval (R, ∞) of R+ , and


g = −e2a(r) dt 2 + e2b(r) dr 2 + r 2 dϑ 2 + sin2 ϑ dϕ 2 .
(4.3)
The Schwarzschild coordinates (t, r, ϑ, ϕ) are well adapted to the symmetries of the
spacetime manifold.
The functions a(r) and b(r) approach zero asymptotically (g is asymptotically
flat). We must now insert the ansatz (4.3) into the field equations. For this, it is
necessary to compute the Ricci tensor (or the Einstein tensor) corresponding to the
metric (4.3). This is accomplished most quickly with the help of the Cartan calculus. The traditional computation using Christoffel symbols is, for instance, given in
detail in [13].
We choose the following basis of 1-forms:
θ 0 = ea dt,

θ 1 = eb dr,

θ 2 = r dϑ,

θ 3 = r sin ϑ dϕ.

(4.4)

The metric (4.3) then reads
g = gμν θ μ ⊗ θ ν ,

(gμν ) = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1).

(4.5)
μ

Thus, the basis {θ α } is orthonormal. Hence, the connection forms ω ν satisfy (see
Sect. 3.6)
ωμν + ωνμ = 0,

ωμν := gμλ ωλν .

(4.6)

In order to determine these from the first structure equation, we compute the exterior
derivatives of θ μ . With a  = da/dr, etc., we have
dθ 0 = a  ea dr ∧ dt,
dθ 1 = 0,
dθ 2 = dr ∧ dϑ,
dθ 3 = sin ϑ dr ∧ dϕ + r cos ϑ dϑ ∧ dϕ.
Expressing the right-hand sides in terms of the basis θ σ ∧ θ ρ , we obtain
dθ 0 = a  e−b θ 1 ∧ θ 0 ,
dθ 1 = 0,
dθ 2 = r −1 e−b θ 1 ∧ θ 2 ,


dθ 3 = r −1 e−b θ 1 ∧ θ 3 + cot ϑθ 2 ∧ θ 3 .

(4.7)

160

4 The Schwarzschild Solution and Classical Tests of General Relativity

When this is compared with the first structure equation dθ α = −ωαβ ∧ θ β , one expects the following expressions for the connection forms:
ω01 = ω10 = a  e−b θ 0 ,
ω02 = ω20 = ω03 = ω30 = 0,
ω21 = −ω12 = r −1 e−b θ 2 ,

(4.8)

ω31 = −ω13 = r −1 e−b θ 3 ,
ω32 = −ω23 = r −1 cot ϑθ 3 .
This ansatz indeed satisfies (4.6) and the first structure equation. On the other hand,
we know that there is unique solution (see DG, Sect. 15.7).
μ
The calculation of the curvature forms Ω ν from the second structure equation is
now straightforward. For example


Ω 01 = dω01 + ω0k ∧ ωk1 = dω01 = d a  e−b θ 0

and Ωμν := gμλ Ω λν = −Ωνμ . From this, one reads off the components of the Riemann tensor with respect to the basis {θ α }. The Ricci tensor can conveniently be

We now solve the vacuum equations for these expressions. The equation G10 = 0

the same form as in the static case. From G00 + G11 = 0 we again obtain the relation
a  + b = 0. Now, however, we can only conclude that
a = −b + f (t).

If we introduce the new time coordinate

we again obtain the Schwarzschild metric (4.12). For r > 2m, a spherically symmetric vacuum field is thus necessarily static (Birkhoff theorem). This should not be too
surprising because of the spin-2 nature of the gravitational field. The Birkhoff theorem is closely related to an analogous fact in electrodynamics: The electromagnetic
field outside a time dependent spherical charge distribution is time independent, and
equal to the Coulomb field of the total charge.
The physical meaning of the integration constant m in (4.12) becomes clear by
comparison with the Newtonian limit at large distances. In this region we must have
g00 ≃ −(1 + 2φ), with φ = −GM/r. Hence,

The Schwarzschild solution (4.12) has an apparent singularity at
r = RS := 2

GM

c2

(4.20)

where RS is the so-called Schwarzschild radius. Schwarzschild himself was quite
disturbed by this “singularity”. For this reason, he subsequently investigated the
solution of Einstein’s field equations for a static, spherically symmetric mass distribution having constant energy density. He showed that the radius of such a configuration must be bigger than 9RS /8. Schwarzschild was extremely satisfied by this
result, since it showed that the singularity is not relevant (for the special case being

164

4 The Schwarzschild Solution and Classical Tests of General Relativity

considered). However, somewhat later, in 1923, Birkhoff proved that a spherically
symmetric vacuum solution of Einstein’s equations is necessarily static for r > RS .
Hence, the exterior field for a non-static, spherically symmetric mass distribution is
necessarily the Schwarzschild solution for r > RS . Clearly, the lower bound 9RS /8
is no longer valid for a non-static situation. Hence it is necessary to investigate in
more detail what is going on in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild sphere r = RS .
We shall do this in Sect. 4.7. It will turn out that the spacetime geometry is not singular there. Merely the Schwarzschild coordinates fail to properly cover the spacetime region for r −→ Rs (“coordinate singularity”). The Schwarzschild sphere has
nevertheless physical significance (as a horizon). When r < RS , the solution is no
longer static. It took remarkably long until all this was clearly understood. Lemaître
was the first who recognized in 1933 the fictitious character of the “Schwarzschild
singularity”.

4.1.2 Geometric Meaning of the Spatial Part of the Schwarzschild
Metric
We shall now give a geometrical illustration of the spatial part of the metric (4.12).
Consider the two dimensional submanifold {ϑ = π2 , t = const} and represent this as
surface of rotation in three-dimensional Euclidean space E 3 . This submanifold has
the induced metric
ĝ =

dr 2
+ r 2 dϕ 2 .
1 − 2m/r

(4.21)

On the other hand, a surface of rotation in E 3 has the induced metric
 


ĝ = z2 dr 2 + dr 2 + r 2 dϕ 2 = 1 + z2 dr 2 + r 2 dϕ 2 ,
where z(r) describes the surface. (We use cylindrical coordinates.) If we require this
to agree with (4.21), then

Integration gives z = (8m(r − 2m))1/2 + const. If we set the integration constant

we first note that F = dA, A = re dt, hence dF = 0. Since ∗F = − re2 θ 2 ∧ θ 3 =

4.2 Equation of Motion in a Schwarzschild Field
We consider a test body in a Schwarzschild field. We know (see Sect. 2.4.1) that
its geodesic equation of motion is the Euler–Lagrange equation for the Lagrangian

2L = −1.

We consider first the ϑ -Euler–Lagrange equation
 2 ·
r ϑ̇ = r 2 sin ϑ cos ϑ ϕ̇ 2 .
This implies that if the motion of the test body is initially in the equatorial plane
ϑ = π2 (and hence ϑ̇ = 0), then ϑ ≡ π2 . We may therefore take ϑ = π2 without loss

It is instructive to have a closer look at the effective potential V (r) in (4.34). As
a function of r/m it depends in an interesting way on the ratio L/m. The limiting
values are√always V (r) −→ −∞ for r −→ 0 and V (r) −→ 1 for r −→ ∞. When
L/m < 2 3 the potential has no critical points (see Fig. 4.2), whence any incoming
particle with E 2 < 1 crashes directly toward r = 2m. Other cases are discussed in
Exercise 4.5 (see also Fig. 4.3).

1. For L/m < 2 3 any incoming particle falls toward r = 2m.

This famous result was presented by Einstein in a lecture delivered to the Prussian
Academy of Sciences in Berlin on 18 November 1915, before he had the definite
field equations with matter (see [74]). For the excess perihelion motion of Mercury
he obtained 43 seconds of arc per century, in very satisfactory agreement with observations. Einstein later told his former collaborator A. Fokker that when he saw
the result he was so excited that he had heart palpitations.
The perihelion shift of Mercury’s orbit was an unsolved problem in celestial
mechanics since the announcement by Le Verrrier in 1859 that, after the perturbing
effect of the other planets on Mercury’s orbit had been accounted for, there remained
in the data an unexplained advance in its perihelion. Various ad hoc proposals were
made to account for this excess, such as the existence of a new planet Vulcan near
the Sun, a ring of planetoids, a solar quadrupole moment, and a deviation from the
inverse-square law of gravitation.—The natural explanation by GR was indeed a
great triumph.
From (4.48) one sees that this important effect of GR is most pronounced when
the orbit’s semi-major axis is small and/or the eccentricity is large. In addition, it is
easier to determine the precise position of the perihelion observationally for large
eccentricities. In the solar system, Mercury provides the most favorable case. Substituting the orbital elements for this planet and the physical constants of the Sun,
the prediction (4.48) gives for the rate of perihelion shift
ω̇ = 42 .98 per century.

(4.49)

On the other hand, the measured perihelion shift of Mercury is known accurately.
The excess shift, after the perturbing effects of the other planets have been accounted
for, is known to about 0.1 percent from radar observations of Mercury since 1966.
Within this uncertainty theory and observation agree.
Before we take a closer look at the Newtonian perturbations, it should be mentioned that the equinoctial precession of the celestial coordinates used in planetary
observations gives an apparent advance of about 5000 per century. The perturbing effects of the various planets on Mercury’s perihelion precession are listed in
Table 4.1. Note that the observational accuracy of 0.1 percent corresponds on Mercury’s orbit to about 300 meters.
An additional Newtonian perturbation is caused by the solar quadrupole moment.
Let us derive the contribution of the solar oblateness to the perihelion shift. The
Newtonian potential exterior to a mass distribution having the matter density ρ(x)
is

(4.56)
Assuming that the Sun rotates uniformly with its observed surface angular velocity one estimates J2 ∼ 10−7 . This agrees with values inferred from rotating solar
models that produce the observed normal modes of solar oscillations (helioseismology). From this we conclude that the solar oblateness effect on the perihelion shift
of Mercury is smaller than the observational error. The perihelion anomaly is almost
entirely given by GR.
This and other solar system tests of GR discussed below involve weak fields.
With the discovery of the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16 by Taylor and Hulse in 1974
strong field effects and the influence of gravitational radiation reaction can be tested.
This will be discussed in detail later in Sect. 6.8. At this point we only mention that
the periastron advance2 of this remarkable close binary system of compact objects
is per day as large as for Mercury in a century. The reader is encouraged to read the
Nobel Prize lectures [128, 129] of Hulse and Taylor.

4.4 Deflection of Light
This is the most important result obtained in connection with the theory of gravitation since
Newton’s day.
—J.J. Thomson (6 November 1919)
2 Literally, the term perihelion shift should be restricted to orbits around the Sun, while the more
general term is periastron.

For the sun we obtain Einstein’s famous prediction
δ = 1.75 R /b.

(4.64)

This result follows already from the linearized theory (see Chap. 5). Thus, the bending of light rays does not depend on the non-linearity of GR; by contrast, the precession of the perihelion does depend on this, as will be shown in Exercise 4.7.
Historically, this prediction of Einstein was first tested during the solar eclipse
of March 29, 1919. Eddington and Dyson organized two expeditions, one to the
Brazilian city Sobral, and the other to the island Principe in the gulf of Guinea.
The effect of the deflection of light is observed as an apparent outward shift in
the position of the stars during the eclipse. This shift can be determined by photographing the stars in the vicinity of the sun during the eclipse and later the same
stars at night. Then one compares the two photographs (see Fig. 4.6).
Sir F.W. Dyson, the Astronomer Royal, had realized that the expected eclipse
should be particularly suitable, since the Sun would be standing before the stellar
cluster of the Hyades. The final result of the two teams were
δ=

1.98 ± 0.12
1.60 ± 0.3

Sobral
Principe.

Based on these, Eddington announced that “there can be no doubt that the values
confirm Einstein’s prediction. A very definite result has been obtained that light is
deflected in accordance with Einstein’s law of gravitation.”

4.4 Deflection of Light

177

The news made headlines in most newspapers, and Einstein quickly rose to international fame. On 27 September 1919 he wrote on a postcard to his mother: “. . .
joyous news today. H.A. Lorentz telegraphed that the English expeditions have actually measured the deflection of starlight from the Sun.”
The history around this event is complicated. For good reasons, controversies
surrounded the reliability of the results at the time. On the other hand, J.J. Thomson,
Chair of the special joint meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Royal
Society of London on 6 November 1919, stated: “This is the most important result
obtained in connection with the theory of gravitation since Newton’s day.” For a
detailed discussion of the experiments and references to the original literature see
[130].
We have mentioned in Sect. 2.2 that in 1914, a German expedition, led by E. Freundlich and funded by Krupp, was sent to the Crimea to photograph the solar eclipse
on 21 August. Due to the outbreak of the First World War, the scientists were imprisoned, and their instruments were confiscated by Russian authorities.
Later, numerous measurements of the bending of light have been performed during solar eclipses. The results show considerable scatter and the accuracies were
low. After 1969, substantial improvements have been made using radio astronomy.
Every year the quasar 3C 279 is eclipsed by the sun on October 8, and thus the deflection of radio waves emitted from this quasar, relative to those from the quasar 3C
273, which is 10◦ away, can be measured. Similar measurements can be performed
on the group 0111+02, 0119+11 and 0116+08.
Before a comparison with GR can be made, it is necessary to correct for the
additional deflection caused by the solar corona. For radio waves, this deflection depends on frequency as ω−2 (see Exercise 4.6). By observing at two frequencies, the
contributions due to the solar corona and the Earth’s ionosphere can be determined
very precisely.
The development of very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) have the capability of measuring angular separations and changes in angles as small as 10−4 seconds of arc. A series of transcontinental and intercontinental VLBI quasar and radio
galaxy observations (made primarily to monitor the Earth’s rotation) was sensitive
to the deflection of light over almost the entire celestial sphere. (Note that at 90◦
from the Sun, the deflection is still 4 milliarcseconds.) A recent analysis of VLBI
data [131] yielded for the ratio of the observed deflection to Einstein’s prediction
the value 0.99997 ± 0.00016.
It has become traditional to parameterize the static, spherically symmetric vacuum field independent of theory. In “isotropic” coordinates, one then has, in place
of (4.16) and (4.17)

For a systematic presentation of the so-called Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN)
formalism and an analysis of solar system tests within this framework, we refer to
[8]. The result of Exercise 4.7 shows that the precession of the perihelion is sensitive to non-linearities of the theory (the parameter β), while the light deflection is
proportional to 12 (1 + γ ). The measurements discussed so far restrict the Eddington–
Robertson parameters as follows:
|γ − 1| < 3 × 10−4 ,

|β − 1| < 3 × 10−3 .

Fig. 4.8 Time delay of radar signals

4.5 Time Delay of Radar Echoes
In 1964 I. Shapiro proposed as a new test of GR to determine the time delay of
radar signals which are transmitted from the Earth through a region near the Sun to
another planet or satellite and then reflected back to the Earth. Suppose that a radar
signal is transmitted from a point 1 with coordinates (r1 , ϑ = π2 , ϕ1 ) to another point
2 with (r2 , ϑ = π2 , ϕ2 ), as indicated in Fig. 4.8.
We first compute the Schwarzschild coordinate travel time t12 required. From

To give an idea of the experimental possibilities, we mention that the error in the
time measurement of a circuit during the Viking mission was only about 10 ns.
We emphasize once more that the coordinate time delay (4.82) cannot be directly
measured. For this, it would be necessary to know (r12 − r02 )1/2 + (r22 − r02 )1/2 extremely precisely (i.e., to better than 1 km for a 1% measurement). Now, the various
radial coordinates in general use (see, e.g., (4.14)) already differ by an amount of the
order of GM /c2 ≃ 1.5 km. For this reason, the theoretical analysis and practical

time-delay measurements.
The solid line gives the
theoretical prediction. (From
[132])

evaluation of the data from a time delay experiment is much more complicated. One
must carry out the measurements of the circuit times over a period of several months
and fit the data to a complicated model which describes the motion of the transmitter and receiver very precisely. The post-Newtonian corrections to the equations of
motion must also be taken into account.3 In every reasonably realistic model, there
is a set of parameters which are not known well enough. It is necessary to include
all these “uninteresting” parameters, along with the relativistic parameter γ (see
(4.65)), in a simultaneous fit.
The first (“passive”) experiments were performed with radar echoes from Mercury and Venus. The rather complicated topography of these planets limited the precision attainable in these experiments. In addition, the reflected signals were very
weak. The result of an early measurement is shown in Fig. 4.9.
The (“active”) radio observations from satellites, in which the reflected signals
are shifted in frequency by a transponder, suffer from the difficulty that the satellites
are subject to strong, non-gravitational perturbations, such as radiation pressure, loss
of gas, etc.
In all the experiments, time delays due to the solar corona provide an additional
source of error. In spite of all these difficulties, the Viking mission (see [133]) provided a very precise determination of γ :
γ = 1 ± 0.001,

(4.84)

confirming the GR prediction γ = 1. An important factor in attaining such an amazing precision is that in the Viking mission two transponders landed on Mars, while
two others continued to orbit the planet. The orbiting transponders transmitted in
3 A similar, but even more demanding analysis will be carried out in Sect. 6.8, in connection with
binary pulsar data. The Shapiro time delay will there also play an important role.

4.5 Time Delay of Radar Echoes

both the S-band and the X-band (unfortunately, the two “landers” could only transmit at S-band frequencies). It was thus possible to determine the rather large time
delays (up to 100 µs) due to the solar corona fairly precisely (since these are proportional to ν −2 ). Since two of the transponders are fixed on Mars, the determination
of the orbits is more precise than was possible with Mariner 6, 7 an 9. One also
discovered that the corona varies considerably with time, and hence that the time
delays cannot be determined sufficiently precisely with a parameterized theoretical
model.
We add that the one-way time delay of signals from the millisecond pulsar PSR
1937+21 have also been measured, but the accuracy is by far not as high as for the
Viking experiment.
More recently, a substantially improved test of the predicted time delay has been
achieved, using the radio multi-frequency links with the Cassini spacecraft. The
experiment was carried out between 6 June to 7 July 2002, around the time of a
solar conjunction when the spacecraft was on its way to Saturn.
What is actually measured is the fractional frequency shift of a stable and coherent two-way signal (Earth–spacecraft–Earth). The expected general relativistic
contribution to this observable is the time derivative of (4.83a), i.e.,
1 dr0
dΔt
= −8m
.
dt
r0 dt
For the parameterized metric (4.65) this is proportional to 1 + γ . Numerically, this
quantity is −(1 × 10−5 s)(1 + γ ) d ln r0 /dr.
The analysis of the experiment led to (see [142])
γ = 1 + (2.1 ± 2.3) × 10−5 .
This is a significant improvement in comparison to (4.84).
Exercise 4.8 Use the electron density (4.68) to compute the time delay caused by
the solar corona.

For the computation of the time delay, one may use the unperturbed straight line
path for the light ray. This can be seen with Fermat’s principle, according to which
the actual path of the ray minimizes the transit time (hence the error is of second
order in the perturbation).

4 The Schwarzschild Solution and Classical Tests of General Relativity

4.6 Geodetic Precession
Suppose that a gyroscope with spin S moves along a geodesic. Then the four-vector
S is parallel transported (see Sect. 2.10.1). As a special case, we consider a circular motion in the plane ϑ = π2 in the Schwarzschild field and compute the corresponding spin precession. The spin precession for general motion will be studied in
post-Newtonian approximation in Sect. 6.6.
In the following, we use the tetrad (4.4) and its dual basis, denoted by {eα }. The
four-velocity u and the spin S of the gyroscope moving along a geodesic satisfy the
equations
S, u = 0,

∇u S = 0,

∇u u = 0.

(4.85)

The components of ∇u S are given by (see DG, (15.61))
μ

(∇u S)μ = Ṡ μ + ω β (u)S β = 0,

(4.86)

where a dot again denotes differentiation with respect to proper time. For circular
motion with ϑ = π2 , we obviously have u1 = u2 = 0. If we now use the connection
forms (4.8) with a = −b, we obtain
Ṡ 0 = −ω0β (u)S β = −ω01 (u)S 1 = −a  e−b θ 0 (u)S 1 = b e−b u0 S 1 .
The other equations are derived similarly. The result is

When expanded in terms of these, S has only spatial components: S = S̄ i ēi . Obviously, we have
S 0 = u3 S̄ 3 ,

S 1 = S̄ 1 ,

S 2 = S̄ 2 ,

S 3 = u0 S̄ 3 .

(4.98)

In addition to the geodetic precession (4.98), there is a further small contribution
from GR which is due to the Earth’s rotation. This Lense–Thirring precession will
be discussed in Sects. 5.2 and 6.6 (see also Sect. 2.10.5). The Stanford Gyroscope
Experiment had as its goals the measurement of these effects. It completed the flight
portion of its mission in the fall of 2005. The final results, reported in [143], are:
The geodetic drift rate is −6601 ± 18.3 mas/yr, and the frame-dragging drift rate is
−37.2 ± 7.2 mas/yr, to be compared with the GR predictions of −6606.1 mas/yr,
and −39.2 mas/yr, respectively (“mas” is milliarcsecond).
The most serious competition for these results comes from the LAGEOS experiment, in which laser ranging accurately tracked the paths of two satellites orbiting
the Earth. The LAGEOS satellites finally yielded tests at a quoted level of approximately 10% [144].
Remarks
1. The Earth is a natural gyroscope. After one “sidereal year” (i.e., Δϕ = 2π ) the
projection of the Earth’s axis on the ecliptic has advanced by the angle
2π(1 − e) = 0.019 .
The sidereal year is characterized by the return of the Sun to the same location
with respect to the fixed stars. The pole axis has then moved with respect to the
fixed stars. However, this effect is masked by other perturbations of the Earth’s
axis.

4.7 Schwarzschild Black Holes

187

2. The Earth–Moon system can be considered as a “gyroscope”, with its axis perpendicular to the orbital plane. The predicted precession, first calculated by de
Sitter in 1916, is about 2 arc-seconds per century. Using Lunar laser ranging data
over many years, this effect has been measured to about 0.7 percent (see [134]).
3. Another natural gyroscope is the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16. As we shall see in
Sect. 6.8, its general relativistic precession amounts to 1.21 deg per year, leading
to a change in the pulse profile and polarization properties. Due to these effects,
spin precession is now detected for several relativistic binaries. (For the Hulse–
Taylor pulsar see [135]; the interesting data from the double pulsar system will
be discussed in Sect. 6.8.)
Exercise 4.9
1. Determine the azimuthal velocity of a circular geodesic orbit in the Schwarzschild field. How large is this on the last stable circular orbit? The result is
vϕ =

L
1

.
r 1 + L2 /r 2

This becomes equal to 1/2 for the last stable circular orbit, and approaches 1 for
the smallest (unstable) circular orbit.
2. Calculate also the radial acceleration for a non-geodesic circular orbit. Show that
this becomes positive for r < 3m. This counter-intuitive result has led to lots of
discussions.
Hints Use the tools developed in Sect. 4.6.

4.7 Schwarzschild Black Holes
In Chap. 7 we shall show that, in spite of the uncertainties in the equation of state,
the mass of non-rotating, cold (neutron) stars is bounded by a few solar masses.
Here we mention only a few important results (see also [137]).
Let ρ denote the mass-energy density, and assume that the equation of state is
known for ρ ≤ ρ∗ , where ρ∗ is not significantly larger than the nuclear matter density ρ0 = 2.8 × 1014 g/cm3 . The mass of a non-rotating neutron star is bounded
by
M/M ≤ 6.75(ρ0 /ρ∗ )1/2 ,

(4.99)

assuming only that the equation of state above ρ∗ obeys ρ > 0 and ∂p/∂ρ > 0.
If, in addition, one assumes that the speed of sound is less than the speed of light,
so that ∂p/∂ρ < c2 , the bound (4.99) can be tightened:
M/M ≤ 4.0(ρ0 /ρ∗ )1/2 .

(4.100)

188

4 The Schwarzschild Solution and Classical Tests of General Relativity

“Realistic” equations of state give typical values of Mmax around 2M . For rapidly
rotating neutron stars this limit increases.
Of course, a supercritical mass can exist in a temporary equilibrium, if pressure is
built up by means of thermonuclear processes. Sooner or later, however, the nuclear
energy sources will be exhausted, and thus a permanent equilibrium is no more possible, unless sufficient mass is “blown off” (for example in a supernova explosion).
Otherwise, the star will collapse to a black hole.
In this section, we shall consider qualitatively the spherically symmetric collapse and the detailed properties of spherically symmetric black holes. Many of the
qualitatively important aspects of the realistic collapse to a black hole are already
encountered in this simple situation. The spherically symmetric collapse is particularly simple, since we know the gravitational field outside of the star. In this region,
it depends only on the total mass of the collapsing object, and not on any dynamical
details of the implosion, as we have already shown for r > 2m in Sect. 4.1 (Birkhoff
theorem). In the following section, we shall extend this result to the case r ≤ 2m.

has an apparent singularity at r = 2m. We shall see that (4.101) becomes singular
at r = 2m only because the chosen coordinate system loses its applicability4 at
r = 2m. A first hint of this behavior comes from the observation that, with respect to
the orthonormal basis (4.4), the Riemann tensor (4.10) is finite at r = 2m. A typical
component is

Hence at r = 2m, the tidal forces remain finite.
Before we continue the Schwarzschild solution beyond r = 2m, let us consider
timelike radial geodesics in the vicinity of the horizon. For L = 0, we obtain from
(4.33) and (4.34) the following equation of motion for a test body in a Schwarzschild
field:
ṙ 2 = 2m/r + E 2 − 1.

(4.102)

4 It is easy to construct coordinate singularities. For example, consider in R2 the metric ds 2 =

dx 2 + dy 2 and introduce in place of x the coordinate ξ = x 3 /3. The transformed metric is given
by
ds 2 = (3ξ )−4/3 dξ 2 + dy 2 ,
which is “singular” at ξ = 0.

Next, we consider radial null directions for the metric (4.101) (for r > 2m and
r < 2m). For these we have ds = 0 and

As r ↓ 2m, the opening angle of the light cones becomes increasingly narrow, as
shown in Fig. 4.11.
The previous discussion indicates that the simultaneous use of the coordinates r
and t is limited. By using the proper time, it is possible to describe events which
only occur after t = ∞.
When r > 2m, t is a distinguished timelike coordinate. The Schwarzschild solution is static and the corresponding Killing field K is just K = ∂/∂t (the corresponding 1-form K  is given by K  = K, K dt). Since the coordinate t is adapted
to the Killing field K, it is uniquely defined, up to an additive constant.
We now wish to continue the Schwarzschild manifold (r > 2m) in such a way
that the Einstein vacuum field equations are always satisfied. This was done most
simply by Kruskal in 1960. We wish to avoid having the light cones contract in a

singular manner for r ↓ 2m. Hence we try to transform to new coordinates (u, v),
for which the metric has the following form




g = −f 2 (u, v) dv 2 − du2 + r 2 dϑ 2 + sin2 ϑ dϕ 2 .
(4.113)
For radially emitted light rays we then have (du/dv)2 = 1 when f 2 = 0. The metrics of the two-dimensional submanifolds {ϑ, ϕ = const} are conformally equivalent
to the 2-dimensional Minkowski metric dv 2 − du2 .
We can easily write down the differential equations for the desired transformation
(ϑ and ϕ are unchanged). From

We may regard r ∗ and y = r ∗ + t as independent variables. In (4.121), both sides

4.7.2 Discussion
1. So far we just made a change of coordinates. In the (u, v)-plane, the Schwarzschild region r > 2m corresponds to the shaded quadrant u > |v| of Fig. 4.12.
The lines r = const in the (u, v)-plane corresponds to hyperbolas. This follows from

4m
In the limit r → 2m these approach the lines at 45◦ in Fig. 4.12. According
to (4.126), the lines t = const correspond to radial lines through the origin, as
shown in Fig. 4.13.
2. However, the transformed metric


g = −f 2 (u, v) dv 2 − du2 + r 2 (u, v) dΩ 2 ,
(4.127)
in which r is implicitly defined as a function of u and v by (4.126), is regular in
a larger region than the quadrant u > |v|.
The region in which (4.127) is non-singular is bounded by the hyperbolas
v 2 − u2 = 1, where according to (4.126) we have r = 0, and hence by (4.125)

4.7 Schwarzschild Black Holes

195

Fig. 4.14 Graph of the
function g

Fig. 4.15 The four quadrants
of the Kruskal region

f 2 becomes singular. For v 2 − u2 < 1, r is a uniquely defined function of u
and v, since the right-hand side of the first equation in (4.126) is a monotonic
function when r > 0; its derivative with respect to r is proportional to rer/2m ,
thus positive for r > 0. If we write (4.126) as u2 − v 2 = g(r/2m), the graph of
the function g looks as in Fig. 4.14. We have thus isometrically embedded the
original Schwarzschild manifold in a larger Lorentz manifold, which is known as
the Schwarzschild–Kruskal manifold. The Ricci tensor vanishes on the extended
manifold. This is a consequence of the next two remarks.
3. In the derivation of the Kruskal transformation, we have arbitrarily chosen the
sign of h to be positive (and hence g to be negative). We could just as well have
chosen the reverse. This would amount to the transformation (u, v) → (−u, −v).
Thus the regions I and III in Fig. 4.15 are isometric.
4. We now consider the original Schwarzschild solution (4.101) formally for
r < 2m. This also satisfies the vacuum equations, as is easily shown by direct
computation (see also the Appendix to this chapter). In this region, r behaves
as a time coordinate and t as a space coordinate. This manifold can be mapped
isometrically onto region II of Fig. 4.15. In order to see this, consider the derivation of the Kruskal transformation once more. For 0 < r < 2m, we now have
F (r ∗ ) < 0, and hence the relative sign of g and h must be positive. If we choose

196

The transformed metric again has the form (4.127), and the function f is also
given in terms of r by (4.125). The image of (0 < r < 2m) under the transformation (4.128) is precisely the region II. The inverse of (4.128) is given by

Taking g and h both negative is equivalent to the transformation (u, v) →
(−u, −v), so that the regions II and IV are mutually isometric.
5. Along the hyperbolas v 2 − u2 = 1, the metric is truly singular. For example, here
the invariant Rαβγ δ R αβγ δ diverges. The Kruskal extension is maximal, which
means that every geodesic can either be extended to arbitrary large values of the
affine parameter, or it runs into the singularity v 2 − u2 = 1 for a finite value
of this parameter. The manifold is geodesically incomplete (see the footnote on
p. 119).
6. The causal relationships in the Schwarzschild–Kruskal manifold are quite obvious. Radial light rays are lines at 45◦ , as in the Minkowski diagram. Observers
in I and III (where the metric is static) can receive signals from IV and send them
to II. However, any particle which enters region II must run into the singularity
at r = 0 within a finite proper time. A particle in region IV must have come from
the singularity at a finite previous proper time. There is no causal connection
between regions I and III.
The singularity in the future is shielded from distant observers in regions I and
III by an event horizon. By definition, this is the boundary of the region which is
causally connected with distant observers in regions I and III, and is given by the
surfaces r = 2m. Signals which are sent from IV to I (or III) will already have
reached I at t = −∞. It is presumably not possible to observe such light.
7. In Sect. 4.7.4 we shall see that the complete Kruskal extension is not relevant in
astrophysics.
8. For a geometric visualization of the Schwarzschild–Kruskal manifold, we represent the two-dimensional surface {v = 0, ϑ = π2 } as a surface of rotation in the
three-dimensional space (see Fig. 4.16). The upper part of the embedding diagram corresponds to u > 0 (I) and the lower part to u < 0 (III). The reader should
consider how the funnel-like structure (“Schwarzschild throat”, “Einstein–Rosen
bridge”) changes for slices with increasing v.
9. The Schwarzschild–Kruskal manifold is static in regions I and III, but is dynamical in regions II and IV. In these regions, the Killing field K = ∂/∂t becomes
spacelike. (At the horizon, K is null: K, K = 1 − 2m/r = 0.) There are no
observers at rest in regions II and IV.

In Appendix to this chapter, we shall prove a generalization of Birkhoff’s theorem (see Theorem 4.1).

4.7.3 Eddington–Finkelstein Coordinates
For spherically symmetric gravitational collapse, only part of the regions I and II
of the Kruskal diagram are relevant. For this part we shall introduce other, frequently used coordinates, which are originally due to Eddington and were rediscovered by Finkelstein. They are related to the original Schwarzschild coordinates
(t, r) in (4.101) by a change of time, but leaving (r, ϑ, ϕ) unchanged:

With the help of these equations, one can readily convince oneself that the transformation (4.131) is regular for u > −v (i.e., in the region I ∪ II). Inserting (4.130) into

This form is valid in the region I ∪ II. The metric coefficients expressed in terms of
the Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates are independent of t  ; the price one pays is
the existence of non-diagonal terms, i.e., a non-trivial shift.
We determine the light cones for (4.133). For radially propagating light rays the

The radial null geodesics corresponding to the first of these equations are given by

the tangents to the null geodesics of the other family have the following properties:
dr

dt 

dr

for r → 2m.

(4.136)

The second of these properties implies that the geodesics do not cross the surface r = 2m. This is indicated in Fig. 4.17. One can easily show that non-radial
null geodesics and also timelike directions have dr/dt  between the two values in
(4.135). Hence the light cones have the structure shown in Fig. 4.17.

4.7.4 Spherically Symmetric Collapse to a Black Hole
We now describe qualitatively the spherically symmetric, catastrophic collapse of
a supercritical mass. Since, according to the generalized Birkhoff Theorem 4.1, the
exterior field is a region of the Kruskal manifold, the collapse is most easily visualized in Kruskal coordinates as in Fig. 4.18. In Fig. 4.19 we show the same process
in Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates. From these two figures we may draw the following conclusions:
1. Equilibrium is no longer possible when the stellar radius becomes smaller than
the radius of the horizon, since the world lines of the stellar surface must lie

200

4 The Schwarzschild Solution and Classical Tests of General Relativity

inside the light cones. Collapse to a singularity cannot be avoided. At some point
in the vicinity of the singularity, GR will probably no longer be valid, since
quantum effects will become important.
2. If a signal is emitted from inside the horizon, it will not reach a distant observer.
The stellar matter is literally cut off from the outside world. Also light rays will
approach the singularity. Thus, the horizon is the boundary of the region which is
causally connected to a distant observer. It is defined generally by this property.
Thus, the event horizon acts like a one-way membrane through which energy
and information can pass to the interior, but not to the exterior. The existence of
horizons, or causal boundaries, in our universe is a remarkable consequence of
GR. The singularity is behind the horizon, and hence has no causal connection
to an external observer; he cannot “see” it. It has been conjectured by R. Penrose
that this is true for all “realistic” singularities (“cosmic censorship hypothesis”).
3. An observer on the surface of a collapsing star will not notice anything peculiar
when the horizon is crossed. Locally the spacetime geometry is the same as it is
elsewhere. Furthermore, for very large masses the tidal forces at the horizon are
harmless (see below). Thus the horizon is a global phenomenon of the spacetime
manifold. Note also the “null surface of last influence” shown in Fig. 4.18.
4. An external observer far away from the star will see it reach the horizon only
after an infinitely long time. As a result of the gravitational time dilation, the
star “freezes” at the Schwarzschild horizon. However, in practice, the star will
suddenly become invisible, since the redshift will start to increase exponentially
(see below), and the luminosity decreases correspondingly. The characteristic
time for this to happen is τ ∼ RS /c ≃ 10−5 (M/M ) s; for M ∼ M this is
extremely short. Afterward, we are dealing with a “black hole”. It makes sense
to call the horizon the surface of a black hole, and the external geometry the
gravitational field of the black hole. The interior is not relevant for astrophysics.
When observed from a distance, the exterior field looks exactly like that of any
massive object. Its surface area is 4πRS2 .
Black holes act like cosmic vacuum cleaners. For example, if a black hole is part
of a close binary system, it can suck up matter from its partner and heat it to such
a degree that a strong X-ray source results. There is strong reason to believe that a
number of X-ray sources arise from such an accretion mechanism. We shall examine
this evidence more closely in Sect. 8.7.
Astrophysicists are by now convinced that gigantic black holes, with perhaps
109 M , exist in the center of many galaxies. The accretion of matter by these black
holes would provide a relatively natural explanation for the huge amounts of energy
which are set free in a rather small volume as observed in active galactic nuclei.
It now appears likely that the central core of most galaxies contains a black hole
of at least 106 M . The best evidence for supermassive black holes has been established for our galaxy (see [140] and [275]). Many years of high resolution astrometric imaging made it possible to determine the orbit for the star (S2) currently closest
to the compact massive black hole candidate Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). The measured
points and the projection of the best fitting Kepler orbit are shown in Fig. 4.20. The
orbital period is 15.2 years, and the pericentre distance of the highly elliptic Kepler

around Sgr A*. Beside the
data points (from NTT/VLT
and Keck measurements) the

shown as a continuous curve.
(From [141])

orbit is only 17 light hours. The orbital elements require an enclosed very compact
mass of (3.7 ± 1.5) × 106 solar masses. This means that the pericentre distance is
about 2100 times the Schwarzschild radius. For further details of these remarkable
findings, see [140, 141]. The future infrared interferometry will offer the possibility
to explore relativistic motions at 10–100 Schwarzschild radii from the central dark
mass, and tighten its interpretation as a black hole.
The current evidence for both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes will be
presented in Sect. 8.7. This has become overwhelming, but is still indirect.

4.7.5 Redshift for a Distant Observer
Suppose that a transmitter approaches the Schwarzschild horizon radially with fourvelocity V . The emitted signals with frequency ωe are received by a distant observer
at rest (with four-velocity U ) at the frequency ω0 (see Fig. 4.21). If k is the wave

which shows that the redshift increases exponentially in the vicinity of r = 2m.

4.7.6 Fate of an Observer on the Surface of the Star
As the stellar radius decreases, an observer on the surface of the star experiences
constantly increasing tidal forces. Since his feet are attracted more strongly than his
head, he experiences a longitudinal stress. At the same time, he is compressed from
the sides (lateral stress). Let us calculate these forces.
As a first step, we compute the components of the Riemann tensor relative to the
basis (4.4). If we insert



e2a = e−2b = 1 −

into the curvature forms (4.9), we obtain

All other components that are not determined by (4.153) and by symmetry properties vanish.
The falling observer with four-velocity U will use his rest system as a frame
of reference. For r > 2m, this is reached by the special Lorentz transformation in
the radial direction, which transforms e0 to the four-velocity U . Remarkably, the

components of the Riemann tensor with respect to this new system are unchanged.
A Lorentz “boost” has the form

The invariance of the other components is shown similarly. This invariance is the
result of the particular structure of the Schwarzschild geometry.
We now follow the observer in quadrant II. For this, we need some results from
the Appendix to this chapter. According to (4.214), the metric in quadrant II has the
form (4.204) with (see (4.214))
e2b = e−2a = (2m/t) − 1,

R = t.

(4.154)

If one inserts these metric functions into the curvature forms (4.208) relative to the
basis (4.205), one obtains the same expressions as we had for r > 2m, except that r
and t are interchanged. If we denote the timelike variable t in (4.154) by r, then the
expressions (4.153) are always valid for the local rest system.
The equation for geodesic deviation implies that the distance between two freely
falling test bodies increases according to (3.11) as
n̈i = R i00j nj ,

(4.155)

where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to the proper time. Using (4.153)

Let us consider a square prism having mass μ and height l with equal length and
width w, as in Fig. 4.23.

206

4 The Schwarzschild Solution and Classical Tests of General Relativity

We now ask what forces must be present in the body in order to avoid having
its various parts move along diverging (or converging) geodesics. From (4.156) we
see that the 1-, 2- and 3-directions define the principal axes of the stress tensor (the
2- and 3-directions are equivalent). The longitudinal stress is calculated as follows:
According to (4.156) an element dμ of the body at a height h above the center of
mass (the distance is measured along e1 ) would be accelerated relative to the center
of mass with a = 2mr −3 h, if it were free to move. In order to prevent this, a force
dF = a dμ =

2m
h dμ
r3

must act on the element. This force contributes to the stress through the horizontal
plane through the center of mass. The total force through this plane is

The longitudinal stress T l is given by T l = −F /w 2 , so that

(4.157)

Similarly, using (4.156), one finds for the lateral stress T⊥ :
T⊥ = +

8 lr 3

(4.158)

As a numerical example, take μ = 75 kg, l = 1.8 m and w = 0.2 m. We find
T l ≃ −1.1 × 1014 M/M (r/1 km)−3 N/m2 ,
T⊥ ≃ 0.7 × 1012 M/M (r/1 km)−3 N/m2 .

(4.159)

For comparison, recall that 1 atmosphere is 1.013 × 105 N/m2 .
When the mass of the black hole is very large, the tidal forces are even at the
Schwarzschild horizon completely harmless.
After the body is finally torn apart, its constituents (electrons and nucleons) move
along geodesics. For r < 2m, these have the qualitative form indicated in Fig. 4.24.
The spatial coordinate t is nearly constant as r → 0 (the reader should provide an
analytic discussion). Thus, when the upper (lower) end has the radial coordinate t2
(t1 ), the length L of the body approaches

and τcollapse = τ |r=0 . For r ≃ 0, we have τcollapse − τ ∝ r 3/2 . For the surface area A

ΔϑΔϕ ∝ r 2 ∝ (τcollapse − τ )4/3 → 0.
The volume V behaves according to
V = AL ∝ r 3/2 ∝ (τcollapse − τ ) → 0.
It is thus not advisable to fall into a black hole.

4.7.7 Stability of the Schwarzschild Black Hole
The Schwarzschild solution is only physically relevant if it is stable against small
perturbations. Whether this is the case is a very difficult unsolved problem. Some
insight can be expected from a linear stability analysis. It turns out (see [138] and
[139]) that the frequencies ωn of the normal modes in the time dependent factors
exp(−iωn t) are all real, because the ωn2 can be shown to be the eigenvalues of a selfadjoint positive operator of the Schrödinger type. (The radial parts of the normal
modes are the corresponding eigenfunctions.)
From this linear stability we can, however, not conclude anything about the stability of the non-linear problem (as is well known from simple examples of ordinary
non-linear differential equations).

4.8 Penrose Diagram for Kruskal Spacetime
In this section, we shall construct a ‘conformal compactification’ of the Kruskal
spacetime. Such constructions make it possible to discuss the behavior at infinity

208

4 The Schwarzschild Solution and Classical Tests of General Relativity

with local differential geometric tools, a point of view that is important for the analysis of gravitational radiation (see Sect. 6.1).
For illustration, let us first recall the well-known example of a conformal compactification of the Euclidean space (Rn , η) provided by the n-sphere S n and its
natural Riemann metric g: From Exercise 3.8, Eq. (3.76) it follows that the inverse
of the stereographic projection from the north pole is a diffeomorphism ϕ such that
ϕ ∗ g is conformal to the flat metric η. Furthermore, the conformal factor Ω, given
by (3.76), has a smooth extension to all of S n . On the north pole it vanishes and
dΩ = 0.

4.8.1 Conformal Compactification of Minkowski Spacetime
As a more relevant example for what follows, we now construct a conformal compactification of Minkowski spacetime. In polar coordinates the Minkowski metric
is


g = −dt 2 + dr 2 + r 2 dϑ 2 + sin2 ϑ dϕ 2 .
(4.160)
It will be useful to introduce the null coordinates u = t − r and v = t + r, in terms
of which we have


1
g = −du dv + (v − u)2 dϑ 2 + sin2 ϑ dϕ 2 .
4

(4.161)

Note that the hypersurfaces {u = const} and {v = const} are null surfaces, i.e.,
du, du = 0 and dv, dv = 0. Both coordinates u, v range over the complete real
line, subject only to the restriction v ≥ u. This unbounded range can be mapped
diffeomorphically to a bounded region, for instance by the map (u, v) −→ (U, V )
given by
u = tan U,

v = tan V ,

(4.162)

with U, V ∈ (− π2 , π2 ) and the restriction V − U ≥ 0. Using
du dv =

1
cos2 U cos2 V

dU dV

and
(v − u)2 =

1
cos2 U cos2 V

sin2 (U − V ),

the metric becomes in the coordinates (U, V , ϑ, ϕ)
g=
where

are also shown

Thus g and g̃ are conformally related as
g̃ = Ω 2 g,

Ω 2 = 4 cos2 U cos2 V .

(4.165)

In contrast to g, the metric g̃ is also defined when U or/and V are equal to ±π/2.
In other words, g̃ is a smooth metric on the compact manifold M̃ = [− π2 , π2 ]2 × S 2 .
The Lorentz manifold (M̃, g̃) is actually a compact submanifold of the Einstein universe, discussed in Sect. 3.2. This becomes obvious by introducing the coordinates
t˜ = U + V and χ = V − U , in terms of which


g̃ = −d t˜2 + dχ 2 + sin2 χ dϑ 2 + sin2 ϑ dϕ 2 .
(4.166)
Here, the spatial part is the metric of S 3 in polar coordinates (χ, ϑ, ϕ).
The compact manifold M̃ is the shaded part of the Einstein cylinder R × S 3 ,
shown in Fig. 4.25. The image of Minkowski spacetime is the open part of this
compact subset. Its boundary, called conformal infinity of Minkowski spacetime,
consists of the following pieces: The two null-hypersurfaces I + and I − , given
by V = π/2, |U | < π/2 for I + and U = −π/2, |V | < π/2 for I − , represent future and past null infinity, respectively. This is where null-geodesics end up. The
points i ± , given by U = V = ±π/2, represent future and past timelike infinity,
where timelike geodesics end. Finally the point i 0 , corresponding to U = −π/2,
V = π/2 represents spacelike infinity. This is the end of all spacelike geodesics.
Note that the conformal factor vanishes on the conformal boundary of Minkowski
spacetime, consisting of I ± , i ± and i 0 , but dΩ = 0 there. This part is fixed by the
Minkowski metric. Any further extension, like the part (−π, π) × S 3 of the Einstein
cylinder, is arbitrary.
The conformal diagram in the (t˜, χ) coordinates is shown in Fig. 4.26. The interior of the triangle corresponds to Minkowski spacetime.

4.8.2 Penrose Diagram for Schwarzschild–Kruskal Spacetime
For the Schwarzschild–Kruskal spacetime we proceed very similarly. Let u, v be the
Kruskal coordinates introduced in Sect. 4.7, and let ũ = v − u, ṽ = v + u. We use
again the transformation (4.162),
ũ = tan U,

ṽ = tan V ,

with (U, V ) ∈ (− π2 , π2 ) and the restriction V − U ≥ 0. In addition, we use the combinations t˜ = U + V and r̃ = V − U . The image of the Schwarzschild–Kruskal
spacetime in the (r̃, t˜)-plane is shown in Fig. 4.27. Note, for example, that in
this Penrose diagram the hyperboloids v 2 − u2 = 1, where the metric (4.113) diverges, are transformed into tan U · tan V = ũṽ = v 2 − u2 = 1. This means that
cos(U + V ) = 0, i.e., t˜ = ±π/2.
For a suitable conformal factor Ω 2 the metric g̃ := Ω 2 g has again a smooth
extension to I ± . Interestingly, it can also be extended to i 0 , however, not in a
differentiable manner; g̃ is only continuous at i 0 .

4.9 Charged Spherically Symmetric Black Holes
The generalization to electrically charged black holes is of theoretical interest, because some new qualitative features will show up. In particular, we shall encounter
two horizons, an external event horizon and an internal “Cauchy horizon”. This we
shall also find for uncharged, but rotating black holes (see Chap. 7). Astrophysically,
charged black holes are of little interest, since macroscopic bodies do not possess
sizable net electric charges.
In Exercise 4.4 we derived the Reissner–Nordstrøm solution as the unique two
parameter family of static, spherically symmetric solutions of the coupled Einstein
and Maxwell equations. In Schwarzschild coordinates the metric and the Faraday
form F are given by (G = 1)

In the following discussion we distinguish the three regions:
0 < r < r−

(region A),

r− < r < r+

(region B),

r > r+

(region C).

It will turn out that {r = r+ } is an event horizon, while {r = r− } is a ‘horizon’ of a
different kind.

positive r. At the point r = 0 we have again a true singularity, as can be seen by
calculating the invariant Rαβγ δ R αβγ δ .
For a better understanding of (4.178) we investigate the radial null geodesics. For
dϑ = dϕ = 0 we obtain
(d t˜ + dr) (1 − f ) d t˜ − (1 + f ) dr = 0.

and the second family satisfies

Numerator and denominator on the right are plotted in Fig. 4.29. At r± the slope
(4.181) becomes vertical. The two families of radial null geodesics are shown in
Fig. 4.30.
From the structure of the light cones we see that the surface {r = r+ } is an
event horizon (one way membrane), similar to the one we found for the uncharged
Schwarzschild solution. Moreover, one sees that a particle crossing this horizon
inward has to move toward the center of symmetry until it crosses or it reaches

214

4 The Schwarzschild Solution and Classical Tests of General Relativity

asymptotically the surface {r = r− }. Note that this is a null hypersurface (characteristic surface).
Somewhat surprisingly, in the region A the light cones are no more inclined toward the center, whence test particles do not need to fall toward the singularity. The
following analysis will actually show that neutral test particles cannot reach the
singularity.

4.9.2 Timelike Radial Geodesics
Neutral test particles move along timelike geodesics of the metric (4.178). We limit
the discussion to radial orbits, but the results can be easily generalized to non-radial
timelike geodesics.

(4.187)

This equation requires F ≥ 0. The allowed region for the radial motion can be seen
from Fig. 4.31. For E 2 < 1 there are two intersections A and B  with F = 0 (note
that g00 −→ 1 for r −→ ∞). At these points ṙ = 0 according to (4.187): ṙ = 0 for
r = rA or r = rB  . The allowed region is rA ≤ r ≤ rB  ; the neutral test particle
oscillates between A and B  .
When E 2 > 1 there is only a minimal distance, that approaches r = 0 with increasing energy. Is there an intuitive reason for the existence of the non-vanishing
minimum distance? Perhaps one can argue as follows: The electrostatic energy density, proportional to 1/r 4 (see Exercise 4.4), leads to an infinitely large electrostatic
energy. Since, however, the total energy has the finite value m, there will necessarily be an infinite amount of negative, non-electrostatic energy. It is because of this
that at sufficiently small distances the gravitational force becomes repulsive. (This
remark demonstrates that the Reissner–Nordstrøm solution is not very physical.)
Let us discuss the motion of the test particle a bit more closely. From (4.187) we
obtain
√
−f F ± E F
,
(4.188)
ṙ =
1 + (1 + f )F
where the double sign corresponds to the two possibilities ṙ > 0 or ṙ < 0. For the
negative sign ṙ is everywhere negative. In particular, at r = r± (f = 1) we find
ṙ|r± = −

2E 2
< 0.
1 + 2E 2

(4.189)

On the other hand, for the plus sign we get
ṙ|r± = 0.

(4.190)

From this it follows that, after the particle has passed the point B  in Fig. 4.31, it
cannot cross the surface {r = r− }, but reaches it asymptotically for t˜ −→ ∞. This
conclusion can also be drawn from the orientation of the light cones at r− (see
Fig. 4.30). The motion of the particle in the (r, t˜)-plane looks therefore as shown in

216

Fig. 4.32 Typical orbit of a
neutral test particle

Fig. 4.32. One finds that it reaches the point B∞ with coordinates r = r− , t˜ = ∞ in
a finite proper time. Timelike geodesics passing through B∞ are thus incomplete.
Below, we shall extend the manifold, using Kruskal-type coordinates, such that these
geodesics do not terminate after a finite affine length.

4.9.3 Maximal Extension of the Reissner–Nordstrøm Solution
In the regions B and C the radial variable r∗ takes the values
−∞ < r∗ < ∞

for r+ < r < ∞,

+∞ > r∗ > −∞

for r− < r < r+ .

In a first step, we introduce in regions A and C the new coordinates

v = t + r∗ .

For piecing together the three regions in a smooth fashion and for the maximal
extension, we introduce further coordinate transformations. In the regions A and C,
we set
tan U = −e−αu = e−α(t−r∗ )


= −e−αt eαr |r − r+ |1/2 |r − r− |−β/2 ,

(4.195)

tan V = eαv = eα(t+r∗ )


= eαt eαr |r − r+ |1/2 |r − r− |−β/2 ,

(4.196)

where

(< 1).

(4.197)

In region B we change some signs:



= eαt eαr |r − r+ |1/2 |r − r− |−β/2 ,

(4.198)

tan V = eαv = eα(−t+r∗ )


= e−αt eαr |r − r+ |1/2 |r − r− |−β/2 .

(4.199)

With these substitutions, the metric takes in all three regions the same form
g=

(4.200)

The coordinate r as a function of U and V is implicitly given by
tan U tan V =

−e2αr |r − r+ ||r − r− |−β
e2αr |r − r+ ||r − r− |−β

(r > r+ and 0 < r < r− )
(r− < r < r+ ).

(4.201)

The three regions A, B and C can be represented (for fixed values of the polar angles ϑ, ϕ) by the three ‘blocks’ in Fig. 4.33. The edges are identified as indicated. By
this procedure we do not yet obtain a ‘geodesically complete’ manifold, as the discussion in the last section shows. As for the Kruskal extension, we can obtain three
other regions A , B  and C  by applying the transformation (u, v) −→ (−u, −v).
Now we can construct a maximal analytic extension by piecing together copies of
the six blocks so that an over-lapping edge is covered by either a u(r)- or a v(r)system of coordinates (with the exception of the corner of each block). This results
in the ‘ladder’ shown in Fig. 4.34 which extends indefinitely in both directions.
Then all geodesics, except those which terminate at the singularity, have infinite
affine lengths, both in the past and in the future directions. The metric (4.200) is
everywhere analytic, except for r = r− , since |r − r− | appears in (4.201) with a
negative power. There the metric is, however, at least C 2 .

Since U and V are null coordinates, the properties of the maximally extended
spacetime are transparent. For example, it is clear that the spacetime region external
to r+ (in C) is very similar to the region of the Schwarzschild spacetime external to
r = 2M = RS . Any observer who crosses the surface {r = r+ }, following a futuredirected timelike orbit, is forever lost to an external observer (in C). The surface
{r = r+ } is an event horizon. However, after crossing this horizon, infinitely many
possibilities are left open. There is, for instance, the possibility to move into a region

Possibilities for timelike
geodesics starting in the
asymptotic region C

A (as indicated in Fig. 4.34). At the instant when the surface {r = r− } is crossed,
something very dramatic happens. A hypothetical observer will witness, in an infinitely blue-shifted flash, a panorama of the entire history of the external world.
(This is discussed in detail in [136].) Should he survive this and enter the region A ,
the observer’s future is no longer determined by his past history. Indeed, the region
A is outside the domain of dependence of the spacelike slice S extending the regions C and C  shown in Fig. 4.34. For this reason the surface {r = r− } between B
and A is called a Cauchy horizon.
As indicated in Fig. 4.34, an observer entering B has also the option to enter the
region A. There is no danger of falling into the singularity. On the contrary, he will
cross the surface {r = r− } between A and B  , and eventually emerge into a new
asymptotically flat universe (C or C  ). For all this to be possible it is crucial that the
singularity {r = 0} is timelike, while it is spacelike for the Schwarzschild–Kruskal
spacetime.

220

4 The Schwarzschild Solution and Classical Tests of General Relativity

There is, of course, the question whether all this is just mathematics. The maximal extension of the Reissner–Nordstrøm solution is probably not physically realized. (Presumably, the Cauchy horizon is unstable.) However, it is a wonderful
source for science fiction writers.

Appendix: Spherically Symmetric Gravitational Fields
In this appendix, we consider non-stationary but spherically symmetric fields and
prove, among other things, the generalized Birkhoff theorem. We recall the
Definition 4.1 A Lorentz manifold (M, g) is spherically symmetric provided it admits the group SO(3) as an isometry group, in such a way that the group orbits are
two-dimensional spacelike surfaces.
We have seen in Sect. 4.1 that the group orbits are necessarily surfaces of constant
positive curvature, and thus the metric 2-spheres (ignoring projective planes).

4.10.1 General Form of the Metric
Let q ∈ M and let Ω(q) be the orbit through q. The (one-dimensional) subgroup of SO(3) which leaves q invariant is the stabilizer Gq . It is isomorphic
to SO(2), and induces a two-dimensional orthogonal irreducible representation
in the tangent space Tq Ω(q). The orthogonal complement of this subspace in
the tangent space Tq (M) will be denoted by Eq . Since the orbits are spacelike,
Eq is a two-dimensional Minkowski space on which Gq acts by isometries, i.e.,
two-dimensional Lorentz transformations. The Lorentz group in two dimensions,
O(1, 1), is a one-dimensional abelian Lie group (isomorphic to the additive group
R). It has, of course, no subgroup isomorphic to SO(2). Hence, Gq acts trivially on
Eq .7
The map p → Ep , p ∈ M, defines a distribution on M, in the sense of Definition C.1 in DG, Appendix C. We want to show that this normal distribution E is
integrable.8 For this we must show that there exists an integral manifold through
each point q ∈ M.
A natural candidate is the image, N (q) under the exponential map of a sufficiently small neighborhood U of the origin in Eq . Obviously, Gq acts trivially on
N(q). To prove that Nq is an integral manifold of E, it suffices to show that at each
point p ∈ N(q) the orbit Ω(p) intersects N (q) orthogonally (see Fig. 4.35). That
7 This simple argument for four-dimensional Lorentz manifolds, as well as further elaborations,
have been communicated to me by D. Giulini.
8 This notion and related concepts are introduced in DG, Appendix C.

families of integral manifolds

between group orbits

this is indeed the case, we note that Gp = Gq for all p ∈ N (q), and consider the following subspaces transverse to Tp (N (q)) in Tp (M) : Wp = Tp (N (q))⊥ , Tp (Ω(p)).
Both are two-dimensional, and on each of them Gp acts orthogonally and irreducibly. (A non-trivial representation of SO(2) in a two-dimensional real vector
space is irreducible.) The two vector spaces can not have a one-dimensional intersection, for this would be an invariant subspace (violating irreducibility). The
two subspaces also cannot be transversal (for then Tp (M) would be the direct
sum of the two, and Tp (N (q)) would not be pointwise fixed. We conclude that
Wp = Tp (Ω(p)), thus Ω(p) indeed intersects N (q) orthogonally at p.
We can now define locally a bijective mapping φ : Ω(q) −→ Ω(p) between
two group orbits as follows: φ maps the point q into the point Ω(p) ∩ N (q). This
mapping is Gq -equivariant, since q, as well as Ω(p) and N (q) are invariant under
Gq (see Fig. 4.36).
Therefore, vectors of Tq Ω(q) having the same length are transformed by φ into
vectors of Tφ(q) Ω(p) having also the same length. Furthermore, since all points in
Ω(q) are equivalent (with respect to the group action), one obtains the same magnification factors for all points in Ω(q); this means that the mapping φ is conformal.
With these remarks we can introduce local coordinates (t, r, ϑ, ϕ) such that the
group orbits be surfaces of constant t and r, and the surfaces N orthogonal to these
are the surfaces {ϑ, ϕ = const}. Since φ is conformal, and since the orbits are metric
2-spheres (see Sect. 4.1), the spacetime metric has the form


g = g̃ + R 2 (t, r) dϑ 2 + sin ϑ dϕ 2 ,
where g̃ is an indefinite metric in t and r.
Expressed more abstractly, (M, g) is, at least locally, a warped product
M = M̃ ×R S 2 ,

(4.202)

where M̃ is a 2-dimensional Lorentz manifold. This means that M is the product
manifold M̃ × S 2 , and the metric has the form
g = g̃ + R 2 ĝ,

(4.203)

222

4 The Schwarzschild Solution and Classical Tests of General Relativity

where g̃ and ĝ denote a Lorentz metric on M̃ and the standard metric on S 2 , respectively, and R is a function on M̃, called the warped function. In the Appendix B of
DG, we discuss general warped products of two pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and
compute, in particular, the Ricci and Einstein tensors in terms of those of the factors
and the warping function. This turns out to be useful in many instances.
We can choose the coordinates r and t on M̃ such that g̃ is diagonal:
g̃ = −e2a(t,r) dt 2 + e2b(t,r) dr 2 .
Indeed, if we start from the general form
g̃ = −α 2 dt 2 − 2αβ dt dr + γ 2 dr 2 ,
we can use the fact that α dt + β dr has an integrating factor: α dt + β dr = A dt 
(see Exercise C.1 in DG, Appendix C). In terms of the coordinates (t  , r) the metric
g̃ has thus the form g̃ = −A2 dt 2 + B 2 dr 2 . Hence, it is always possible to introduce
coordinates such that the metric has the form



g = −e2a(t,r) dt 2 + e2b(t,r) dr 2 + R 2 (t, r) dϑ 2 + sin2 ϑ dϕ 2 .

(4.204)

At this point, one still has the freedom to choose either t or r arbitrarily on M̃. In
the following, we shall repeatedly make use of this fact.
We will need the connection forms and curvature forms corresponding to the
metric (4.204), as well as the Ricci and Einstein tensors not only in this appendix,
but also in later chapters. Let us compute these relative to the orthonormal basis
θ 0 = ea dt,

θ 1 = eb dr,

θ 2 = R dϑ,

θ 3 = R sin ϑ dϕ.

Exterior differentiation of the θ μ results immediately in (the prime denotes ∂/∂r

4.10.2 The Generalized Birkhoff Theorem
We now consider spherically symmetric solutions of the vacuum field equations,
and prove the following
Theorem 4.1 (Birkhoff’s Theorem) Every (C 2 -)solution of the Einstein vacuum
equations which is spherically symmetric in an open subset U is locally isometric
to a domain of the Schwarzschild–Kruskal solution.
Proof The local solution depends on the nature of the surfaces {R(t, r) = const}.
We first consider
(a) The surfaces {R(t, r) = const} are timelike in U and dR = 0. In this case, we
may choose R(t, r) = r. If we now use Ṙ = 0 and R  = 1 in G01 = 0, we find
from (4.209) and (4.212) that ḃ = 0. This information, together with G00 +
G11 = 0, i.e. Ẽ − F̃ = 0, implies a  + b = 0. Hence a(t, r) = −b(r) + f (t).
Thus, by choosing a new time coordinate, one can arrange things such that a
is also independent of time. The equation G00 = 0 then gives (re−2b ) = 1, or
e−2b = 1 − 2m/r. Thus, for case (a) we obtain the Schwarzschild solution for
r > 2m:

− r 2 dϑ 2 + sin2 ϑ dϕ 2 .

r
1 − 2m/r
(b) The surfaces {R(t, r) = const} are spacelike in U and dR = 0. In this case, we
may choose R(t, r) = t. Now the equation G01 = 0 gives the condition a  = 0,
so that a depends only on t. We now obtain ȧ + ḃ = 0 from G00 + G11 = 0, and

Spherically Symmetric Gravitational Fields

225

we can introduce a new r-coordinate such that b also depends only on t. Finally
we obtain from G00 = 0 the equation (te−2a )· = −1 or
e−2a = e2b =

2m
− 1,
t

R = t,

(4.214)

where t < 2m. This is the Schwarzschild solution for r < 2m, for if we interchange the variables r and t, we obtain (4.213) with r < 2m.
(c) Suppose, that dR, dR = 0 in U . Consider first the special case, that R is constant in U . Then G00 = 0 implies R = ∞. We may therefore assume that dR is
lightlike and not equal to zero. The coordinates (t, r) can be chosen such that
R(t, r) = t − r. If dR is lightlike, then we must have a = b. The equation G01
is then automatically satisfied and from G00 + G11 = 0 we obtain the condition
a  = −ȧ. Hence a is a function of t − r. The equation G00 = 0 then implies
the ridiculous condition t −1 − r = 0. Case (c) is therefore incompatible with the
field equations.
(d) Suppose finally, that {R(t, r) = const} is spacelike in some part of U and timelike in another part. In this case one obtains the solutions (a), respectively (b).
As in Sect. 4.7.4, one can join these smoothly along the surfaces dR, dR = 0,
thereby obtaining a domain of the Schwarzschild–Kruskal spacetime.


4.10.3 Spherically Symmetric Metrics for Fluids
We now consider the spherically symmetric field of a (not necessarily static) fluid,
whose four-velocity U is also assumed to be invariant with respect to the isotropy
group SO(3). Hence U is perpendicular to the orbits and its integral curves lie in the
surfaces N . We may choose t such that U is proportional to ∂/∂t. Since U, U  =
−1, we have
∂
.
(4.215)
∂t
We could have chosen the time coordinate such that U = ∂/∂t, but then the (t, r)part of the metric would not necessarily be diagonal, but would have the form
U = e−a

g̃ = −dt 2 + 2grt dt dr + grr dr 2 .

(4.216)

For an ideal fluid with p = 0 (incoherent dust), the field equations imply ∇U U = 0.
The r-component of this equation implies Γ rtt = 0 or, in other words, ∂gtr /∂t = 0.
Let us therefore choose the new coordinates
 r

t =t +
gtr (r) dr,
r  = r.
Then the metric takes the form (suppressing the primes)


g = −dt 2 + e2b dr 2 + R 2 (t, r) dΩ 2

(4.217)

226

4 The Schwarzschild Solution and Classical Tests of General Relativity

and
∂
.
(4.218)
∂t
However, this is only possible when p = 0.
Of course, for a static situation, the four-velocity U (in (4.217)) should be proportional to a timelike Killing field, which can choose to be ∂/∂t (by a suitable
choice of coordinates). In this case, R, a and b are independent of t. In the basis
(4.205), the energy-momentum tensor has the diagonal form
U=

T μν = (p + ρ)U μ U ν + pg μν = diag(ρ, p, p, p).

(4.219)

If we would have R  = 0, then, because of G00 − G11 = 8πG(ρ + p), this would
imply ρ + p = 0. This is excluded for normal fluids. We may therefore choose
R(r) = r. For a static situation, we can thus always introduce coordinates such that
the metric has the form



g = −e2a(r) dt 2 + e2b(r) dr 2 + r 2 dϑ 2 + sin2 ϑ dϕ 2 .
(4.220)
This will be important in our study of relativistic stars (e.g., neutron stars) in Chap. 7
(see Sect. 7.10).

4.10.4 Exercises
Exercise 4.11 Let (M, g) be a spherically symmetric, stationary Lorentz manifold
with timelike Killing field K. Assume that K is unique. Show that then K is even
static and perpendicular to the SO(3)- orbits Ω(q).
Solution Since K is assumed to be unique, it must be invariant under all rotational
isometries. This implies that it is orthogonal to any orbit sphere Ω(p), since a nonvanishing orthogonal projection of K on an SO(3) orbit would also be invariant;
but such an invariant vector field can not exist. Next, we note that the function R in
(4.204) is invariant under the flow of K, since R has a geometrical meaning (4πR 2
is the area of an orbit). Therefore, LK R = 0, i.e., K, ∇R = 0. Hence, K must be
orthogonal to the hypersurface Σ , generated by the integral curves of ∇K starting
from an orbit sphere. (This argument assumes that the gradient if R does not vanish,
but the staticity of K remains valid.)
Exercise 4.12 Derive (4.210) and (4.212) from the general formulas for warped
products, obtained in the Appendix B of DG.

Weak Gravitational Fields

Most gravitational fields encountered in the physical universe are weak. Exceptions
are the strong fields near compact objects (black holes and neutron stars) or in the
very early universe. It is remarkable that Einstein investigated weak gravitational
fields quite exhaustively only one month after his first systematic exposition of
GR (see [74]). Because of a computational error in his derivation of the so-called
quadrupole formula for the power, emitted by a material source in the form of gravitational waves,1 he took the subject up again somewhat later and added some important considerations (see [75]).

5.1 The Linearized Theory of Gravity
In this chapter, we consider systems for which the metric field is nearly flat (at least
in a certain region of spacetime). Then there exist coordinate systems for which
gμν = ημν + hμν ,

|hμν |  1.

(5.1)

For example, in the solar system, we have |hμν | ∼ |φ|/c2  GM /c2 R ∼ 10−6 .
However, the field can vary rapidly with time, as is the case for weak gravitational
waves.
For such fields, we expand the field equations in powers of hμν and keep only
the linear terms. The Ricci tensor is given, up to quadratic terms, by
Rμν = ∂λ Γ λνμ − ∂ν Γ λλμ .

(5.2)

Here, we can use the linearized approximation


Γ αμν = ηαβ (hμβ,ν + hβν,μ − hμν,β ) = hα μ,ν + hα ν,μ − hμν ,α .

which he proposed the first Lorentz-invariant equation for the gravitational field.

Weak Gravitational Fields

We adopt the convention that indices are raised or lowered with ημν or ημν , respectively. Then the Ricci curvature can be written as
Rμν =


1 λ
h μ,λν − hμν − hλ λ,μν + hλ ν,λμ ,
2

(5.4)

and for the scalar Riemann curvature we obtain
R = hλσ ,λσ − h,

(5.5)

h := hλλ = ηαβ hαβ .

(5.6)

where

In the linear approximation, the Einstein tensor is given by
2Gμν = −hμν − h,μν + hλ μ,λν + hλ ν,λμ + ημν h − ημν hλσ ,λσ .

(5.7)

The contracted Bianchi identity reduces to
Gμν ,ν = 0,

(5.8)

as one also sees by direct computation. As a consequence of (5.8) and the linearized
field equations
hμν + h,μν − hλ μ,λν − hλ ν,λμ − ημν h + ημν hλσ ,λσ = −16πGTμν ,

(5.9)

we obtain
T μν,ν = 0.

(5.10)

Thus in this approximation the gravitational field generated by Tμν does not react
back on the source. For example, if we consider incoherent dust, Tμν = ρuμ uν , then
μ
Eq. (5.10) implies, beside (ρuμ ),μ = 0, also uν u ,ν = 0 or duμ /ds = 0, so that the
μ
integral curves of u are straight lines.
As a first step of an iterative procedure for weak fields, one can determine hμν
from the linearized field equations (5.9) with the “flat” Tμν and compute the reaction
on physical systems by setting gμν = ημν + hμν in the basic equations of Sect. 2.4.
This procedure makes sense as long as the reaction is small. We shall discuss some
specific examples further on.
In the following, it will be useful to work with the quantity
1
γμν := hμν − ημν h,
2

(5.11)

in terms of which hμν is given by

hμν = γμν − ημν γ ,

We may regard the linearized theory as a Lorentz covariant field theory (for the
field hμν ) in flat space. (This point of view was adopted in Sect. 2.2.) If we consider
a global Lorentz transformation, we obtain from the transformation properties of
gμν with respect to coordinate transformations, that hμν transforms as a tensor with
respect to the Lorentz group. Indeed, if

where η := diag(−1, 1, 1, 1), then we can write

∂x α ∂x β

so that
hαβ = Λμα Λνβ hμν .

(5.14)

As is the case in electrodynamics, there is a gauge group. The linearized Einstein
tensor (5.7) is invariant with respect to gauge transformations of the form
hμν −→ hμν + ξμ,ν + ξν,μ ,

(5.15)

where ξ μ is a vector field, as one can easily verify by direct computation. This
transformation can be regarded as an infinitesimal coordinate transformation. In
fact, let
x μ = x μ + ξ μ (x),

(5.16)

where ξ μ (x) is an infinitesimal vector field (it must be infinitesimal to preserve
(5.1)). This transformation induces infinitesimal changes in all fields. With the exception of the gravitational field, which is described by the infinitesimal hμν , it is
possible to neglect these changes in the linearized theory. From the transformation

Weak Gravitational Fields

Gauge invariance can be expressed more geometrically as follows: Previously,
we emphasized that the metric g is physically equivalent to ϕ ∗ g for any diffeomorphism ϕ. In particular, g is equivalent to φs∗ g, where φs denotes a local flow of some
vector field X. For small s we have
 
φs∗ g = g + sLX g + O s 2 .
If we express this in terms of h := g − η, and set ξ = sX, this amounts to
 
 
h −→ h + Lξ g + O s 2 = h + Lξ η + Lξ h + O s 2 .
Thus, it is clear that for weak fields h and h + Lξ η are physically equivalent for an
infinitesimal vector field ξ . Since
(Lξ η)μν = ξμ,ν + ξν,μ ,
this amounts to the substitution (5.15). With this interpretation of gauge transformations the gauge invariance of the linearized Riemann tensor R (1) can be understood
conceptually as follows: The Riemann tensor R[g] fulfills the covariance property
φs∗ (R[g]) = R[φs∗ g]. Hence, we have




d
R[g + sLX g] .
LX R[g] =
ds s=0

(5.17)

If we now set g = η on both sides, we find 0 = R (1) (LX η), and thus
R (1) (h + LX η) = R (1) (h)
for every vector field X. This argument shows: Since the Riemann tensor vanishes
to zeroth order, it is gauge invariant to first order.

5.1.1 Generalization
For later use we generalize this discussion to small perturbations h around some
curved background metric ḡ. The gauge transformations are
h −→ h + Lξ ḡ

or

hμν −→ hμν + ξμ|ν + ξν|μ ,

(5.18)

where an upright line denotes covariant derivative with respect to the background
metric.
If ḡ satisfies the vacuum equations Ric[ḡ] = 0, then the linearized Ricci tensor is
gauge invariant. This follows as before from




d
Ric[ḡ + sLξ ḡ] .
Lξ Ric[ḡ] =
ds s=0

(5.19)

5.1 The Linearized Theory of Gravity

231

If Ric[ḡ] does not vanish, (5.19) implies for the linearized Ricci tensor δRμν [h] the
transformation law
δRμν −→ δRμν + Lξ R̄μν ,
where R̄μν is the Ricci tensor of the background metric. We can easily find an
explicit expression for the linearized Ricci tensor δRμν [h] by using the Palatini
identity (3.86)

and are invariant under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms

for any vector field ξ . These substitutions can be written as
hμν −→ hμν + ξμ|ν + ξν|μ ,
δTμν −→ δTμν + T̄ λμ ξλ|ν + T̄ λν ξλ|μ + T̄μν|λ ξ λ .

(5.23)

The linearized field equations describe the propagation of small disturbances on a
given spacetime background, satisfying the field equations with energy-momentum
tensor T̄μν . In vacuum they reduce to
ḡ αβ (hβμ|να − hαβ|μν + hβν|μα − hμν|βα ) = 0.

(5.24)

Returning to weak perturbations of Minkowski spacetime, we now make use of
gauge invariance to simplify the field equations. One can always find a gauge such
that2

Zürich, see [61] and [73].

Weak Gravitational Fields

This gauge is called the Hilbert gauge. To see that (5.25) can be achieved we note
that the gauge transformation
hμν −→ hμν + ξμ,ν + ξν,μ
translates to
γμν −→ γμν + ξμ,ν + ξν,μ − ημν ξ λ,λ .

(5.26)

Thus, we obtain

μν
μ
,ν = 0, we merely need to choose ξ to be a solution of

ξ μ = −γ μν,ν
in order to satisfy the Hilbert condition. Such solutions always exist (retarded potentials).
For the Hilbert gauge, (5.13) simplifies considerably:
γμν = −16πGTμν .

(5.27)

The most general solution of (5.27) satisfying the subsidiary condition (5.25), is
γμν = 16πGDR ∗ Tμν + solution of the homogeneous wave equation,

(5.28)

where DR is the retarded Green’s function
DR (x) =

4π|x|

Note that
∂ν (DR ∗ Tμν ) = DR ∗ ∂ν Tμν = 0,
so that the first term of (5.28) indeed satisfies the Hilbert condition (5.25). We shall
discuss the solutions to the homogeneous equation (weak gravitational waves) in
Sect. 5.3.
The retarded solution is explicitly

γμν (x) = 4G

We interpret this as the field generated by the source, while the second term in
(5.28) represents gravitational waves coming from infinity. As in electrodynamics,
we conclude that gravitational effects propagate at the speed of light.

5.1 The Linearized Theory of Gravity

233

Remarks In this gauge dependent formulation all components hμν appear to be radiative. For a better understanding of the linearized theory it is helpful to introduce
gauge invariant variables (a formalism that is often used in cosmological perturbation theory). The details can be found in Sect. 2.2 of [145]. It turns out, as expected,
that the total number of free, gauge-invariant perturbations is six. The linearized
Einstein equations imply that four of them satisfy Poisson-type equations, and only
two obey wave-like equations. The latter are described by the transverse and traceless part of the metric, that will be introduced in Sect. 5.3. That other components
of the metric appear to be radiative in some gauges, but this is a gauge artifact. Such
gauge choices, although useful for calculations, can thus lead to confusions of gauge
modes with truly physical radiation.

5.1.2 Exercises
Exercise 5.1 Compute the Riemann tensor in the linearized theory and show by an

Exercise 5.3 Show that the Lagrangian density (5.30) changes only by a divergence
under gauge transformations (5.15). Thus if ξ μ vanishes on the boundary of D, the
action integral over D is invariant under gauge transformations. Using this, derive
the Bianchi identity (5.8) from (5.31).
Remark Since L changes if the gauge is changed, the canonical energy-momentum
tensor (from SR) is not gauge invariant. This is a reflection of the non-localizability
of the gravitational energy. Even in the linearized theory, it is not possible to find
gauge invariant expressions for the energy and momentum densities.
Exercise 5.4 Show that Einstein’s vacuum field equations are uniquely determined
by the following three requirements:
(a) General invariance;
(b) the linearized approximation agrees with (5.9) for Tμν = 0 (massless spin-2
equation in Minkowski spacetime);
(c) the field equation is linear in the second order derivatives.

Remark This says, roughly speaking, that the linearized theory determines already
the full theory, as a result of its general invariance. This fact is quite remarkable.

5.2 Nearly Newtonian Gravitational Fields
We now consider nearly Newtonian sources, with T00  |T0j |, |Tij | and such small
velocities that retardation effects are negligible. In this case (5.29) becomes to leading order



g = −(1 + 2φ) dt 2 + (1 − 2φ) dx 2 + dy 2 + dz2 .

(5.35)

Note that in this Newtonian approximation the spatial part of the metric is nonEuclidean. At large distances from the source, the monopole contribution to (5.33)

The errors in the metric (5.36) are:

GR.
(b) γ0j vanishes up to terms of order vφ, where v ∼ |T0j |/T00 is a typical velocity
of the source. The first order terms will be treated below.
(c) γij vanishes, up to terms of order φ|Tij |/T00 .
In the solar system, all of these corrections are of order 10−12 , while φ ∼ 10−6 .
Remark We have seen in Sect. 2.7 that Fermat’s principle (2.90) and (5.36) imply
that light rays behave in almost Newtonian fields exactly as in an optical medium

with index of refraction (2.92):
n = 1 − 2φ.

(5.38)

Later in this Chapter (see Sect. 5.8) we shall use this to develop the foundations of
gravitational lensing theory.

5.2.1 Gravitomagnetic Field and Lense–Thirring Precession
In the next order (in 1/c) we encounter for rotating sources the “gravitomagnetic
field”. If the spatial stresses Tij can be neglected, the field equations (5.27) reduce
to
γij = 0,

γ0μ = −16πGT0μ .

(5.39)

Thus Aμ := 14 γ0μ satisfies Maxwell type equations:
Aμ = −4πJμ ,

(5.40)

where Jμ = GT0μ is proportional to the mass-energy current density. (Note that
A0 = −φ.) It is natural to define “gravitational electric and magnetic fields” E and
B by the same formulas in terms of Aμ as in electrodynamics.
Let us now assume that the time derivatives of γμν can be neglected (quasistationary situations). Then Δγij = 0 in all space, whence γij = 0, and hence Aμ
describes the gravitational field completely. These potentials are given by

T0i (x  ) 3 
A0 = −φ,
Ai (x) = G
(5.41)
d x.
|x − x  |
Next, we show that the geodesic equation of motion for a neutral test particle
can be expressed in this approximation entirely in terms of the gravitoelectric and
gravitomagnetic fields E and B:
ẍ = E + 4ẋ ∧ B.

(5.42)

The factor 4 in the “magnetic term” reflects the spin-2 character of the gravitational
field.
For the derivation of (5.42) we first note that the metric can be expressed in terms
of Aμ as
g00 = −1 + 2A0 ,

g0i = 4Ai ,

gij = (1 + 2A0 )δij .

Hence, the effective Lagrangian is

(5.44)

As in electrodynamics, the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equations are found to
agree with (5.42).
With these results it is easy to determine the Lense–Thirring precession of a gyroscope, due to the gravitomagnetic field. One can simply translate the well-known
e
spin precession formula in electrodynamics, Ṡ = μ ∧ B, where μ = 2m
S, by the
substitution e → m and B → 4B. This gives the precession frequency
Ω LT = −2∇ × A.

(5.45)

This agrees with (2.166).

Exercise 5.5 Show that the metric (5.37) implies the correct deflection of light rays.

5.3 Gravitational Waves in the Linearized Theory
We now consider the linearized theory in vacuum. In the Hilbert gauge, the field
equations then read (see (5.27))
γμν = 0.

(5.50)

For the free field, it is possible to find, even within the Hilbert gauge class, a gauge
such that we also have
γ = 0.

(5.51)

This can be seen as follows. According to (5.26), a change of gauge has the effect
γμν −→ γμν + ξμ,ν + ξν,μ − ημν ξ λ,λ ,
and hence γ −→ γ − 2ξ λ,λ as well as
γ μν,ν −→ γ μν,ν + ξ μ .
In order to preserve the Hilbert condition γ

μν
,ν = 0, we have to impose

ξ μ = 0.

(5.52)

μ
If γ = 0, then we must seek a ξ μ which satisfies (5.52) as well as 2ξ ,μ = γ . Note

that (5.52) requires the consistency condition γ = 0, which is generally satisfied
only in vacuum. However, this condition is also sufficient. In order to prove this we
show that if φ is a scalar field such that φ = 0, then there exists a vector field ξ μ
μ
with the properties ξ μ = 0 and ξ ,μ = φ.
μ
Construction of the vector field ξ μ : Let ημ be a solution of η ,μ = φ. Such a
μ
solution exists; one may take ημ = Λ,μ , with Λ = φ. Now let ζ = ημ . Since
μ
ζ ,μ = 0, there exists3 an antisymmetric tensor field f μν = −f νμ , such that ζ μ =
μν
f ,ν . Now let σ μν = −σ νμ be a solution of σ μν = f μν . Then
ξ μ := ημ − σ μν,ν
satisfies the equations
ξ μ,μ = ημ,μ = φ,
ξ μ = ημ − σ μν,ν = ζ μ − f μν,ν = 0.
Within the gauge class determined by (5.25) and (5.51), only gauge transformations
which satisfy the additional conditions
ξ μ = 0 and ξ μ,μ = 0

(5.53)

are allowed. For this gauge class we have γμν = hμν .
3 This follows from Poincaré’s Lemma, written in terms of the codifferential (see DG,
Lemma 14.2).

to the residual gauge invariance, only two of them are independent.
Under a gauge transformation belonging to the vector field



(5.58)
the polarization tensor εμν changes according to
εμν −→ εμν + kμ εν + kν εμ .

(5.59)

Now, consider a wave which propagates in the positive z-direction:
k μ = (k, 0, 0, k).

(5.60)

From (5.56) we have
ε0ν = −ε3ν ,

ε01 = −ε31 ,

ε02 = −ε32 ,

Note that the first equation is equivalent to ε00 = −ε30 = −ε03 = ε33 . Equation
(5.57) implies −ε00 + ε11 + ε22 + ε33 = 0, so that
ε11 + ε22 = 0.
These relations permit us to express all components in terms of
ε00 , ε11 , ε01 , ε02 and ε12 .

(5.61)

In particular, we have
ε03 = −ε00 ,

ε13 = −ε01 ,

ε23 = −ε02 ,

ε33 = ε00 .

ε22 = −ε11 ,

(5.62)

5.3 Gravitational Waves in the Linearized Theory

239

For a gauge transformation (5.59), the components (5.61) transform as
ε00 −→ ε00 − 2kε0 ,

ε11 −→ ε11 ,

ε02 −→ ε02 − kε2 ,

ε12 −→ ε12 .

ε01 −→ ε01 − kε1 ,

(5.63)

If we require that (5.58) satisfies the conditions (5.53), then we have k μ εμ = 0, i.e.,
ε0 = −ε3 . It then follows from (5.63) that one can choose ε μ such that only ε12
and ε11 = −ε22 do not vanish. As for light, one has only two linearly independent
polarization states. Under a rotation about the z-axis, these transform according to

This shows that the polarization states ε± have helicity ±2 (left, respectively right

hμ0 = 0,

hkk = 0

hkj,j = 0,

where hkk := 3k=1 hkk .
We now consider a general gravitational wave hμν of the linearized theory. For
each plane wave of the Fourier decomposition, we choose the special gauge (5.65).

Weak Gravitational Fields

Since the gauge conditions (5.65) are all linear, they will then be satisfied for the
general wave under consideration. We have thus shown that the gauge conditions
(5.65) can be satisfied for an arbitrary gravitational wave. If a symmetric tensor
satisfies (5.65), we call it a transverse, traceless tensor, and the gauge (5.65) is
known as the transverse, traceless gauge (TT gauge). Note that for the TT gauge
only the hij are non-vanishing, and hence we have only six wave equations
hij = 0.

(5.66)

We now compute the linearized Riemann tensor in the TT gauge. For any gauge,
we have
R μσ νρ = ∂ν Γ μρσ − ∂ρ Γ μνσ + quadratic terms in Γ.
Using (5.3) for the Christoffel symbols, we obtain (Rμσ νρ = gμλ R λσ νρ )

Rμσ νρ = (hσ μ,νρ + hρμ,σ ν − hρσ,μν ) − (hσ μ,νρ + hνμ,σρ − hνσ,μρ )

Ri0j 0 = (h0j,0i + hi0,j 0 − hij,00 − h00,ij ) = − hTij,00

(5.68)

Since the Riemann tensor is gauge invariant, one sees from (5.68) that hμν cannot
be reduced to fewer components than we achieved in the TT gauge.

5.3.3 Geodesic Deviation in the Metric Field of a Gravitational
Wave
For an understanding of the action of a gravitational wave on matter (a detector) it
is helpful to look at the induced oscillations of the separations between neighboring
freely falling test particles. As in Sect. 3.1 we consider a congruence of timelike
geodesics, representing a swarm of freely falling small bodies. The separation vector
satisfies the equation for geodesic deviation (3.9). Relative to an orthonormal triad
{ej } perpendicular to the four-velocity field, which is parallel transported along an
arbitrary geodesic γ (τ ) of the congruence, we can write this in the form (3.12):
d2
n = Kn,
dτ 2
where Kij = R i00j .

(5.69)

5.3 Gravitational Waves in the Linearized Theory

241

There exists a TT-coordinate system, such that hμν satisfy the TT conditions
(5.65), for which, to leading order in the hij , we have along γ
∂/∂x i = ei

(i = 1, 2, 3),

∂/∂t = e0 := γ̇ .

(5.70)

Such a system can be constructed in two steps. One first constructs a local inertial
system along γ (for which t = τ ), as in Sect. 2.10.6. For this (5.70) holds. Then one
performs an infinitesimal coordinate transformation, such that the TT conditions
(5.65) are satisfied.
According to (5.68) and (5.69), we have (since t is equal to the proper time τ
along γ ) to first order in the hij

This equation describes the oscillations of test bodies near γ induced by weak gravitational waves. For example, if the particles were at rest relative to one another
before the wave arrives (n = n(0) for hij = 0), then integration of (5.71) results in
 j

Let us consider the special case of a plane wave propagating in the z-direction.
In the TT gauge the non-vanishing components are
hTxxT = −hTyyT = A(t − z),

(5.73)

hTxyT = hTyxT = B(t − z).

The particle will not oscillate if it is moving in the direction of propagation (n(0) =
j
(0, 0, a)), since then hij n(0) = 0. Hence only transverse oscillations are possible.
We shall now discuss these for various polarizations of the incident plane wave. The
transverse components of the displacement vector n satisfy
n̈⊥ = K⊥ n⊥ ,
where

If A× = 0, the principal axes coincide with the x- and y-axes. If A+ = 0, the principal axes are rotated by 45◦ . For obvious reasons, we say that the wave is linearly
polarized in these two cases. If A× = ±iA+ , the wave is said to be (right, respectively left) circularly polarized. For the upper sign, the principal axes rotate in the
positive direction (counter clockwise for a wave approaching the reader), and in
the negative direction for the lower sign. Note that the principal axes rotate at the
frequency ω/2.
Figure 5.1 shows the motion of a ring of test particles moving about a central
particle in the transverse plane, for the two linearly polarized states.

5.3.4 A Simple Mechanical Detector
Gravitational wave detectors are instruments that are highly sensitive to the extremely weak tidal forces induced by a gravitational wave. The best hopes for the

first direct detections of gravitational radiation lies with large-scale interferometers.
Several such detectors are now ready or are being upgraded. We shall say more on
this later (see Sect. 5.6). At this point it may be helpful to discuss a simple idealized
oscillator.
Consider two masses m connected by a massless spring of equilibrium length
2l0 . We choose the orientation of the system as shown in Fig. 5.2. Let ω0 be the
frequency of the oscillator, and assume that the damping time τ0 is much larger than
1/ω0 . If the separation of the two masses is 2(l0 + ξ(t)), then the relative separation
ξ(t) satisfies the differential equation

ξ̇ + ω02 ξ = tidal acceleration.

The tidal acceleration can easily be obtained from our previous results. Consider
an incoming periodic wave (5.80) propagating in the z-direction of a TT-coordinate
system, with wave length much larger than the size of the detector. If we choose
the polarization with principal axis along the x- and y-axes (A× = 0), then the tidal
acceleration matrix K⊥ in (5.75) is

5.4 Energy Carried by a Gravitational Wave
We have learned in Sect. 3.4 that in GR it is impossible to define energy- and momentum densities of a gravitational field. On the other hand, we have just seen that
gravitational waves put energy into material systems (detectors) they pass through.
Therefore, it should be possible to associate energy flux to a plane wave, at least in
an averaged approximate sense.
A very physical way to arrive at such an expression is described in the text book
[14]. We repeat here only the general idea; the details are fully given in [14].
Consider an array of idealized oscillator detectors, discussed at the end of the
last section, nearly continuously distributed on a plane on which an incident plane
wave is vertically impinging. After some transients the oscillators will carry out
steady oscillations under the influence of the tidal forces of the wave. Thus the wave
supplies energy to each oscillator, whose time average we have computed in (5.85).
From this it is easy to obtain the time averaged energy put into the oscillators per
unit surface and time. It is very reasonable to define this as the change δF of the net
energy flux F of the wave.
On the other hand, each oscillator will radiate waves (see Sect. 5.5 below), which
interfere with the primary wave. Exactly downstream this interference is destructive,
and a calculation (familiar from electrodynamics) leads to a certain expression for
the change δA of the amplitude A of the gravitational wave. The crucial result is that
the ratio δF/δA is given by the following simple formula, in which the properties
of the detector have dropped out:
1
δF
=
ω2 A.

(5.92)

In the remainder of this section we give a more formal justification of (5.92).
We begin with a few qualitative remarks on the notion of a gravitational wave.
This is an idealized approximate concept, as is the case for wave phenomena in
other fields of physics. By “gravitational waves” we mean propagating ripples
in curvature on scales much smaller than the characteristic scales of the background spacetime. A typical example is the time dependent field due to an aspheric core collapse of a massive star. This produces outgoing fluctuations in the
gravitational field outside the star (supernova) on a background which is approximately described by the Schwarzschild metric. A good analogy to this are water
waves as small ripples rolling on the ocean’s surface with its large scale curvature.
Clearly, the separation into ripples and background cannot be precise, but nearly
so, because of the widely different length scales involved. We proceed with a more
precise discussion (see also Sect. 35 of [15]).

5.4.1 The Short Wave Approximation
For a gravitational wave propagating through a vacuum background with metric ḡ
we introduce two length scales: L denotes a typical curvature radius of the background, and λ a typical wavelength of the wave (see Fig. 5.3). We assume that
λ/L  1. For the decomposition of the full metric gμν into the background ḡμν
plus fluctuation hμν ,
gμν = ḡμν + hμν ,

(5.93)

we assume that the magnitude ε of a typical amplitude of the ripples described by
hνμ is much smaller than 1. More precisely, we assume that there are coordinate
systems (called “steady”) such that

where the round brackets stand for “typical value of”.
With this set up we expand the Ricci tensor in powers of h about the background
R̄μν :
(1)
(2)
+ Rμν
+ ··· .
Rμν = R̄μν + Rμν
(1)

(5.94)

(2)

Note that Rμν ∼ ε/λ2 , Rμν ∼ ε 2 /λ2 , etc. The background contribution R̄μν is a
non-linear phenomenon: We expect that the energy density contained in the wave,
averaged over regions much larger than λ but small in comparison to L, is of order
1
2
−2
G (ε/λ) . The Einstein equation then implies that the background curvature (∼ L )
(2)
is about G times this energy density, thus of the same order as Rμν . In certain
situations the background may even be entirely due to the waves.
The linearized approximation of the field equations has already been discussed
briefly in Sect. 5.1. Recall that
(1)

Rμν

In vacuum this has to vanish

Rμν
[h] = 0,

(5.96)

(1)

since Rμν is the only linear term in (5.94). In second order (∼ ε 2 /λ2 ) the vacuum
field equation implies
(2)
.
R̄μν = −Rμν

(5.97)

At this point we introduce averages over four-dimensional spacetime regions that
are much larger than λ, but small in comparison to L. Denoting these by · · · , we
can split (5.97) into two equations, namely an averaged (smooth) part

The slowly varying part (5.98) is equivalent to the following equation for the background Einstein tensor,

This equation for the background suggests that Tμν
has to be regarded as the
effective energy-momentum tensor for the gravitational wave. For high frequency
waves this notion is well-defined in an averaged sense. It loses meaning as soon as
λ is no more much smaller than L. (Analogous averaged quantities are used at many
places in physics, for instance in the electrodynamics of media.)

5.4.2 Discussion of the Linearized Equation Rμν

Rμν transforms as

[h] = 0 is only gauge invariant if the backTherefore, the linearized equation Rμν
ground Ricci tensor R̄μν vanishes. Because of (5.98) this is not the case, but R̄μν is
(1)
of higher order than Rμν . Moreover, since Lξ R̄μν involves partial derivatives, the
violation of gauge invariance is very small. Up to such small terms which we can
safely ignore, we can thus impose gauge conditions on hμν , while keeping (5.96).
In the ideal case when we consider the propagation equation (5.96) on a fixed background with vanishing Ricci curvature, the following discussion will be exact.
In a first step we impose the Hilbert gauge condition:

γμν |ν = 0,

(5.104)



γμν = hμν − ḡμν h h = hλλ .

(5.105)

This can always be enforced. Indeed, γμν

|ν

transforms under (5.102) as (use the
|ν

γμ ν|ν −→ γμ ν|ν + ξμ |ν − R̄μν ξ ν .

(5.106)

Hence, if the ξμ are chosen such that
|ν

ξμ |ν − R̄μν ξ ν = −γμ ν|ν ,
then the transformed γμν satisfies (5.104). But this hyperbolic system of partial
differential equations always locally has solutions.

5.4 Energy Carried by a Gravitational Wave

249

Now we write Eq. (5.96), i.e.
|α

|α

|α

−hμν|α + hαμ|ν + hαν|μ − h|μν = 0,

(5.107)

in terms of γμν , and impose (5.104). A straightforward calculation (see Exercise 5.9)
leads to
γμν|α

|α

+ 2R̄αμβν γ αβ − R̄αμ γ αν − R̄αν γ αμ = 0.

(5.108)

Here, we ignore the last two terms because they are of order ε 2 /λ2 , while the leading
order of (5.107) is ε/λ2 . This leads us to the propagation equation
γμν|α

|α

+ 2R̄αμβν γ αβ = 0

(5.109)

within the Hilbert gauge class. Note again, that this is exact in the idealized limit
mentioned earlier.
Is it possible to require also h = 0, as for the Minkowski background? To answer
this question we first note that the Hilbert condition is preserved if ξμ satisfy
|ν

ξμ |ν − R̄μν ξ ν = 0.

(5.110)

It will be useful to write this equation in terms of differential forms. Let ξ = ξμ dx μ
and let  = δ ◦ d + d ◦ δ be the wave operator for differential forms with respect to
the background metric, then (5.110) is equivalent to
ξ = 0.

(5.111)

|μ

Since γ := γ λλ −→ γ −2ξμ , γ can be made equal to zero within the Hilbert gauge,
if the 1-form ξ can be chosen such that it satisfies (5.111) as well as 2δξ = γ . For
this to be possible, the following consistency condition
γ = 2δξ = 2δξ = 0
must be satisfied. This is not strictly consistent with (5.108), which implies (taking
the trace)
γ + 2R̄αβ γ αβ = 0.

(5.112)

However, the consistency condition is violated by very small terms. (For the idealized case there is again no inconsistency.)
Adopting the argument in Sect. 5.3 for weak fields, we now show conversely, that
the condition γ = 0 is also sufficient. In other words, we prove the
Lemma 5.1 Given a function φ with φ = 0, then there exists locally a 1-form ξ
with
ξ = 0,

δξ = φ.

(5.113)

250

5

Weak Gravitational Fields

Proof Choose first a 1-form η with δη = φ. This is always possible: Take η = dΛ of
a function Λ which satisfies Λ = φ. Next, let ζ = η and note that δζ = δη =
φ = 0. Hence, by Poincaré’s lemma there exists locally a 2-form ϕ with ζ = δϕ.
Now, choose a 2-form σ such that σ = ϕ. We claim that ξ := η − δσ satisfies
the equations (5.113). Indeed, δξ = δη = φ, and ξ = η − δσ = ζ − δϕ = ζ −
ζ = 0.

Summarizing, to sufficient accuracy we can use (5.112) for the Hilbert gauge
class, and impose—up to higher order inconsistencies—in addition the gauge condition γ = 0.

5.4.3 Averaged Energy-Momentum Tensor for Gravitational Waves
A direct calculation of (5.101) is very involved (see [158, 159]). It is much simpler
(2)
to compute the right-hand side Gμν  in (5.101) with the help of the identity (3.226),
which relates the Einstein tensor to the Landau–Lifshitz pseudo-tensor. We take the
average of the quadratic part in hμν of this equation:

(5.114)

In evaluating averages we can make use of the following rules. First, we can ignore
averages of spacetime derivatives, because these can be transformed to surface integrals, whereby the order with respect to 1/λ is increased by 1. For this reason we
can “integrate by parts”: AB,α  = −A,α B. Furthermore, we can leave out terms
which (possibly after partial integration) vanish as a result of the linearized equation
(5.96).
In a first step we obtain from (5.114)

Gμν(2) . Turning to the right-hand side, we recall that tLL is quadratic in the first

Further simplifications can be made for the average of (5.119) by using the first
order equation (5.96), after some partial integrations. Note that partial integrations
under · · ·  can also be done with respect to covariant derivatives. Since we kept in
(5.119) only the leading contributions of order ε 2 /λ2 , we can replace (5.96) by any
equation that differs by terms which are a positive power of λ/L times smaller. We
can thus use (5.112), if the Hilbert condition is imposed. We may even leave out
the curvature term in (5.112), because this induces only a fractional error of order
(λ/L)2 . On the right-hand side of (5.119) we can also interchange covariant derivatives, making again a fractional error of order (λ/L)2 . With this and the leading

In the solved Exercise 5.11 we shall obtain this result more directly. (Recall that
(5.122) is based on the expression (3.217) for the Landau–Lifshitz pseudo-tensor,
which was the result of rather heavy calculations.) For a harmonic wave (5.80) this

Weak Gravitational Fields

Exercise 5.11 (Energy and momentum of a plane wave) Consider in linearized theory a not necessarily harmonic wave hμν (x 1 − t), propagating in the x 1 -direction.
Show that it is possible to find a gauge within the Hilbert gauge class such that
at most h23 and h22 = −h33 do not vanish (TT gauge). Compute the energyμν
α .
momentum complex tLL in this particular gauge by using formula (3.198) for ∗tLL
Solution The Hilbert condition γ νμ,ν = 0 implies (γ 0μ ) = (γ 1μ ) . Apart from an
irrelevant integration constant (we are only interested in time-dependent fields), this
equation is also valid for the γμν . Hence
γ 00 = γ 10 ,

γ 01 = γ 11 ,

γ 02 = γ 12 ,

γ 03 = γ 13

and thus γ 00 = −γ 11 . The independent components are therefore γ00 , γ02 , γ03 , γ22 ,
γ23 and γ33 .
By introducing a gauge transformation with a vector field of the form ξ μ (x 1 − t),
so that ξ μ = 0 and ξ λ,λ = ξ0 + ξ1 , the independent components transform as
γ00 −→ γ00 − ξ0 + ξ1 ,

γ02 −→ γ02 − ξ2 ,

γ22 −→ γ22 − ξ0 − ξ1 ,

γ23 −→ γ23 ,

γ03 −→ γ03 − ξ3 ,
γ33 −→ γ33 − ξ0 − ξ1 .

(5.130)

Among these, γ23 and the combination γ22 − γ33 remain invariant. Obviously, it is
possible to make γ00 , γ02 , γ03 , and γ22 + γ33 vanish by a suitable choice of ξμ . Then
γ = 0 and thus γαβ = hαβ . Moreover,

We now compute the energy-momentum 3-forms (3.198) in this gauge. We shall
perform the calculation with respect to an orthonormal basis. In the linearized theory, such a basis has the form
θ α = dx α + ϕ αβ dx β ,

(5.131)

ϕαβ + ϕβα = hαβ .

(5.132)

where

Equation (5.132) determines only the symmetric part of ϕαβ . Under infinitesimal
local Lorentz transformations, ϕαβ is changed by an antisymmetric contribution.
We may thus choose ϕαβ to be symmetric, i.e., ϕαβ = 12 hαβ . Since
dθ α = ϕ αβ,γ dx γ ∧ dx β ≃ ϕ αβ,γ θ γ ∧ θ β
one finds, to first order in ϕαβ , for the connection forms


ωαβ = ϕ αγ ,β − ϕβγ ,α dx γ .

(5.133)

5.4 Energy Carried by a Gravitational Wave

255

For our special plane wave, the ϕαβ are functions only of u = x 1 − t, and hence

nγ ,
ϕαβ,γ = ϕαβ

(nγ ) := (−1, 1, 0, 0).

Therefore,
ωαβ = φα nβ − φβ nα ,


φα := ϕαγ
dx γ .

(5.134)

Since only ϕ23 and ϕ22 = −ϕ33 do not vanish, we note that
nα φα = 0,

nα nα = 0.

(5.135)

From this it follows that ωαβ ∧ ωαγ = 0 and the first term of the Landau–Lifshitz

5.5 Emission of Gravitational Radiation
In this section we investigate, in the framework of the linearized theory, the energy
radiated in the form of gravitational waves by time-dependent sources. For this we
need the retarded solution (5.29) in the Hilbert gauge

at large distances from the localized sources.
Far away from the matter sources we can replace the denominator of (5.138) by
|x| ≡ r, while the retarded time can be approximated by
t − x − x  ≃ t − r + x  · x̂,

x̂ := x/r.

The asymptotic field is thus

5.5.1 Slow Motion Approximation
Later we shall calculate the energy loss for arbitrary time variations of T μν , but let
us first study the case when the time variation of T μν is sufficiently slow that we
can approximate the retarded time in (5.139) by t − r,

indices. Then the integral can be conveniently transformed by making use of

In contrast to electrodynamics, the lowest multipole is quadrupole radiation. This,
of course, is due to the spin-2 nature of the gravitational field. For the same reason
the prefactor in (5.155) differs from the one for the quadrupole radiation in electrodynamics.
Let us express the total energy EGW radiated by the source in terms of the Fourier
transform

5.5.2 Rapidly Varying Sources
Let us generalize these results, making only the assumption that the fields are weak,
but may be rapidly varying in time. Then we have to use the expression (5.139) for
the asymptotic field.
It is useful to replace T μν in (5.139) by its Fourier transform with respect to time

5.5.3 Radiation Reaction (Preliminary Remarks)
Within the approximations assumed in this section, the concept as well as the formulas for gravitational wave energy loss far away from the sources will presumably
satisfy most readers. A much more difficult question is, however, whether and exactly how the gravitational luminosity LGW is related to the time derivative of some
energy E of the sources, given as an explicit functional of the instantaneous state of
the sources.
For Newtonian sources (like our planet system) it is certainly very reasonable to
expect that the Newtonian energy E(t) suffers a secular change given by
dE
= −LGW ,
dt

(5.168)

as we are used to in electrodynamics. Below we shall explore the consequences of
this for a binary star system. The justification of (5.168), and its extension beyond
the Newtonian dynamics, is a difficult problem. For this it is necessary to derive the
full equations of motion of a binary system, say, to sufficiently high orders at least
until time-odd terms show up. Since LGW is in leading order proportional to c−5
(like the quadrupole radiation in electrodynamics) a post-Newtonian expansion for
the motion of the sources at least to order c−5 is required.
In recent years, after many previous attempts, this demanding work has been
carried out by several groups, using different methods. More about this will be said
in Chap. 6. This kind of analytic work on post-Newtonian celestial mechanics is
a field of active research. Unavoidably, the details are exceedingly involved, and
there are still loose ends. These investigations are important for the interpretation of
future observations of binary neutron star or black hole coalescence.–
At the time of preparing this new edition, the subject seems to be largely settled,
and astonishing agreement with numerical simulations has been reached.

5.5.4 Simple Examples and Rough Estimates
Let us now apply our basic formulas, in particular (5.155) and (5.158), to some concrete systems. This will allow us to estimate the gravitational radiation of interesting
astrophysical sources.

5.5.5 Rigidly Rotating Body
Consider a body, rigidly rotating about the 3-axis with frequency ω. An important
example is a binary star system in circular orbits about their common center of mass.
If ρ(x  ) denotes the mass density of the body relative to Euclidean coordinates x 

262

5

Weak Gravitational Fields

fixed in the body, then the time dependent mass density in the inertial (laboratory)
frame is given by ρ(x, t) = ρ(x  ), where
x1 = x1 cos ωt − x2 sin ωt,
x2 = x1 sin ωt + x2 cos ωt,

(5.169)

x3 = x3 .
To simplify things we assume that the rotation is around one of the principal axis of
the ellipsoid of inertia. We can then also choose the other two body fixed axes along
principal directions. Then the moment-of-inertia tensor in body fixed coordinates,

 

(5.170)
Iij = ρ x  xi xj d 3 x  ,
is diagonal. Relative to the inertial system, the components of this tensor are

.

Note that its time dependence goes with twice the rotation frequency. The trace-free
quadrupole tensor is given by
Qij = 3Iij − δij Ikk .

(5.172)

This determines hTijT by (5.158), and LGW according to (5.155).
Before proceeding with this example, we recall that according to (5.76) the relative amplitude Δl/ l of spatial oscillations between test particles, induced by a
linearly polarized harmonic plane wave (5.80), is equal to 12 A+ or 12 A× , where A+
and A× are the amplitudes of hTμνT for the two linear polarizations. It is natural to
introduce as a measure the total strain

(5.173)
h := A2+ + A2× .
Note also, that for a plane wave (5.80) the average gravitational energy flux is according to (5.126) given by

1-direction at a distance D:

Along the 3-axis the wave is circularly polarized, with A× = iA+ ,
A+ =

One day measurements of the polarization of waves from the orbital motion of
a binary system may reveal the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight, a crucial

More interesting is a binary star system of masses m1 and m2 in circular orbits
about their common center of mass. If r is the separation of the two orbits, we have

Note that GM 2 /c2 r is, up to a factor 2, the ratio of the Schwarzschild radius belonging to the total mass to the separation of the system.
When, for instance, an inspiraling binary neutron star system, caused by the emission of gravitational radiation, becomes very narrow, LGW becomes huge. Take, for
example, two neutron stars with masses ≃ 1.4M at a separation r = 100 km (orbital period ≃ 10−2 ) s, then (5.184) gives LGW ≃ 1052 erg/s.
This example suggests the following rule of thumb: An astronomical orbiting
system of mass M and size R will have a luminosity of gravitational radiation

The ‘compactness parameter’ GM/c2 R, entering with the fifth power, is usually
very small, but will not be much smaller than 1 when two black holes coalesce
at the end of an inspiraling phase. There are high hopes to observe such events
with laser interferometers. Gravitational waves provide the only way to make direct
observations of black holes.
Let us compute the total strain h for a binary star system. Using in (5.179) Kepler’s third law we arrive at

(5.187)

For the above example of two neutron stars we find for D ≃ 30 000 ly (distance to
the center of the Milky Way) the total strain h ≈ 10−18 . Laser interferometers have
now routinely reached in the kHz region a sensitivity of ∼ 10−21 , and in some years
10−22 should be achieved.
Let us again abstract from this example a rule of thumb. If the motion inside an
astrophysical source is highly non-spherical, then a typical component of Q̈kl will

where φint is a characteristic value of the Newtonian gravitational potential inside
the system. So
h  φint φext ,

(5.189)

where φext is the gravitational potential at the distance D. This agrees with (5.186).
For a coalescing binary neutron star system, we have φint ∼ 0.2. If we observe
such an event in the Virgo cluster, say, we can expect h ∼ 5 × 10−22 . This is about
the Bohr radius measured in astronomical units, and illustrates the goal of detector
development and the heroic efforts that have to be invested.
Estimates of the strain induced by various astrophysical sources in ground based
and space based detectors as a function of frequency are shown in Fig. 5.4.

Note that the dependence on the two masses is proportional to M5/3 , where M
is the so-called chirp mass given by
M = η5/3 m,
where m = m1 + m2 and η = m1 m2 /(m1 + m2 )2 .
In an effort over more than twenty years, Hulse and Taylor succeeded to verify
this expression by observations of a remarkable binary system, which consists of a
pulsar (PSR 1913+16) and a compact partner, which is also a neutron star. A detailed
discussion of this system will be given in Sect. 6.8.
We shall see that the very precise measurements of the pulse arrival times over
years made it possible to determine not only the Keplerian parameters, but also
certain post-Keplerian parameters, such as the precession of the periastron. These
then fix the masses m1 and m2 of the two neutron stars to an amazing precision:
m1 = 1.4411 ± 0.0007M ,

m2 = 1.3873 ± 0.0007M .

Using also the ‘measured’ values
T (day) = 0.322997462736(7),

e = 0.6171308(4)

in (5.202), the predicted secular orbital period change is the tiny number
Ṫtheor = (−2.40243 ± 0.00005) × 10−12 .
For the precise comparison with the observed value, it is necessary to take into
account a small correction due to the relative acceleration between the binary pulsar
system and the solar system caused by the differential rotation of the galaxy. Then
theory and observation agree within the errors of about 0.5%. This is a great triumph
of GR, which leaves little room for doubt in the validity of the quadrupole formula
for other systems.

5.6 Laser Interferometers
Laser interferometry is based on the Michelson interferometer. Laser light is used to
measure changes in the difference between the lengths of two (nearly) perpendicular
arms. Beside many sources of noise, such differences are induced by the strain of
a gravitational wave passing through the instrument. A Michelson interferometer
operating between freely suspended mirrors is ideally suited to measure these.
Figure 5.6 is a schematic drawing of an equal-arm Michelson interferometer. For
LIGO, the largest operating detector, the two arms have lengths of 4 km. Light sent
from the laser light source to the beam splitter is divided evenly between the two
arms. Having traversed the arms, the light is reflected back to the splitter by mirrors
at their far ends. On the return journeys to the photodetector (photodiode), the roles
of reflection and transmission in the splitter are interchanged for the two beams
and, furthermore, the phase of the reflected beam is inverted by 180◦ . Therefore the

5.6 Laser Interferometers

271

recombined beams heading toward the photodetector interfere destructively, while
the beams heading back to the light source interfere constructively. The interference
arms are adjusted such that the photodetector ideally sees no light, all of it having
been diverted, by perfect interference, back to the source. One would get this kind
of perfect interference if the beam geometry provides a single phase over the propagating wavefront. An idealized uni-phase plane wave has this property, as does the
Gaussian wavefront in the lowest order spatial mode of a laser.
If, in the absence of any disturbances, the interferometer is carefully balanced so
that no light appears at the photodetector, a sufficiently strong gravitational wave
passing through the interferometer can disturb this balance and cause light to fall on
the detector. That is the principle how laser interferometers will sense gravitational
waves. To obtain the required sensitivity, various refinements have to be added. We
indicate only two, namely multi-pass arrangement and power recycling (for details,
see the review article [147]).
It is beneficial to arrange for the light to remain in an arm longer than the time
to go up and down, since the intensity change at the photodetector due to a gravitational wave depends on the interaction time of the wave in the arms. A multi-pass
arrangement is used in the arms of the interferometer. This can be achieved with a
Fabry–Perot resonant cavity. In practice this trick results in a light-storage time of
about 1 ms. That is about 50 times longer than a single straight transit through a
3 km arm.
A second trick is called power recycling. By making the entire interferometer a
resonant optical storage cavity the interfering light intensity is increased. Most of the
light interferometrically diverted from the photodetector direction (when the arms
are unstrained) returns toward the light source. That makes it possible to achieve a
significant gain by placing another mirror between the laser and the beam splitter. By
properly choosing this extra mirror’s position and making its transmission equal to
the optical losses inside the interferometer, one can match the losses so that no light
at all is reflected back to the laser. This is equivalent to increasing the laser power
by about a factor of 50–100, without adversely affecting the frequency response of
the interferometer to a gravitational wave.
The success of an interferometer (or any other detector) ultimately depends on
how well noise sources are under control. That has always been the prime technological challenge in this field. An obvious noise, particularly severe for interferometers, is caused by ground vibrations. External mechanical vibrations must be
screened out. Readers, who are interested in such and other issues are again referred
to the review [147], and references therein. The expected noise contributions of the
LIGO II interferometer are shown in Fig. 5.7.
Presumably, the first generation of large gravitational detectors (GEO 600,
LIGO I, VIRGO, TAMA 300) will not yet have the sensitivity for serious astronomical observations, and perhaps not even for a first detection. The observations
are planned to go through several upgrades with ever increasing sensitivity. Efforts
are on the way with the goal of a future pan-European project called EURO.
A detector in space would not notice the Earth’s noisy environment. The LISA
project, studied by both ESA and NASA would open up the frequency window
between 0.1 mHz and 100 mHz for the first time (see [147] and [148]). LISA, with

arms of 5 × 106 km long would see, for example, the coalescence of gigantic black
holes in the centers of galaxies with extraordinary sensitivity (see, in this context
Fig. 5.4). There is also the exciting prospect that LISA may discover gravitational
waves that have been produced in the very early universe.
As useful supplements of our brief treatment of gravitational waves, their sources
and detection, we refer to the textbook [146] and the review articles [149–151],
which also contain lots of references.

5.7 Gravitational Field at Large Distances from a Stationary
Source
We now consider a stationary gravitational field far away from a stationary isolated
source (star, black hole) and determine the leading terms of its expansion in powers
of 1/r.
For a stationary field we choose an adapted coordinate system, with respect to
which the gμν are independent of time. Since spacetime is asymptotically flat, we
choose the coordinates to be asymptotically nearly Lorentzian:
gμν = ημν + hμν ,

|hμν |  1.

In a first step, we ignore the non-linearity of the field equations in the asymptotic
region. There we have then according to (5.27) in the Hilbert gauge,
Δγμν = 0,

1
γμν := hμν − ημν h.

Every solution of the Laplace equation Δφ = 0 can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics as

(5.205)

We now decompose B j k and B j kl into irreducible pieces with respect to the rotation
group. For B j k we have
B j k = δ j k B + S j k + Aj k ,

(5.206)

where B is the trace of B j k , S j k is symmetric and traceless, S jj = 0, and Aj k =

δ B + S j k + Aj k δ j k − 3nj nk = −3S j k nj nk = 0,
which means that
S j k = 0.
For B j kl we use the result of Exercise 5.15, which shows that, after imposing the
Hilbert condition,


B j kl = δ j k Al − Aj δ kl + Ak δ j l .

Within the Hilbert gauge, one can choose B in γ0j and Aj in γj k to vanish. This
is achieved with the gauge transformation defined by the vector field with covariant

The constants m and S j will be interpreted further on.
Up to now we have considered only the linear approximation in the asymptotic
region. The dominant non-linear terms must be proportional to the square, (m/r)2 ,
of the dominant linear terms. In order to calculate them, it is simplest to consider the
Schwarzschild solution in appropriate coordinates and expand it in powers of m/r.
First of all, we note that the Hilbert gauge condition is the linearized form of the
harmonic gauge condition x μ = 0. According to (3.242) this can be written as
√

−gg μν ,ν = 0.
(5.210)
Now

√
−g ≃ 1 + 12 h and g μν ≃ ημν − hμν , and hence
√
−gg μν ≃ ημν − γ μν .

(5.211)

Thus, in the linear approximation, (5.210) does in fact reduce to the Hilbert gauge
μν
condition γ ,ν = 0.
For this reason, we transform the Schwarzschild solution

to harmonic coordinates. These are constructed using the results of Exercise 5.16.
The transformed Schwarzschild metric then reads, if now r = (x i x i )1/2 ,

Now, we compute the energy and angular momentum of the system, using the
asymptotic expressions (5.213). We use the expressions (3.209) and (3.214) for
these quantities in terms of flux integrals. In our coordinates, the connection forms

The total angular momentum is the sum of (5.217) and (5.218):

We have thus shown that the parameters S j in (5.213) are the components of the
system’s angular momentum.
On the other hand, we have representations of P 0 and Jk in terms of volume
integrals (see (3.207) and (3.208)). For the particular case that the field is weak

The angular momentum S k of a system can be measured with a gyroscope. Suppose this is far away from the source and at rest in the coordinate system in which
(5.213) is valid. The gyroscope then rotates relative to the basis ∂/∂x i with the
angular velocity (see (2.166))

5.7.1 The Komar Formula
For a stationary asymptotically flat metric of an isolated system there is a nice intrinsic formula for the total mass M in terms of the stationary Killing field, known

With Stoke’s theorem we can convert the integral (5.223) into a volume integral
if there are no horizons present. For this we need the identity
d ∗ dk = 2 ∗ R(k),

(5.224)

where R(k) is the 1-form with components Rμν k ν . To prove this we contract in the
Ricci identity
kσ ;ρμ − kσ ;μρ = R λ σρμ kλ
the indices σ and ρ and use the consequence k σ;σ = 0 of the Killing equation kσ ;ρ +
kρ;σ = 0. This gives
−kσ ;μ;σ = kμ;σ;σ = −Rμσ k σ .

(5.225)

This implies (see DG, (15.105))
δ dk = −2R(k),

(5.226)

where δ is the codifferential. But this last equation is equivalent to (5.224).

in irreducible pieces as follows (round brackets indicate symmetrization in the enclosed indices):
B j kl = δ j k Al + C (j δ k)l + ε ml(j E k)m + S j kl ,
where E km is symmetric and traceless and S j kl is completely antisymmetric and
traceless in all pairs of indices. From (5.205) we then have
C j = −2Aj ,

E km = S j kl = 0.

5.8 Gravitational Lensing
Gravitational Lensing has become an important field in astronomy and astrophysics.
In recent years the rate and quality of the data have rapidly improved, thanks to
considerable improvements of the observational capabilities (wide-field cameras,
new telescopes, etc.).

5.8 Gravitational Lensing

281

Gravitational lensing produces magnifications and distortions of light beams
from distant sources. It has the distinguishing feature of being independent of the
nature and the physical state of the deflecting mass distributions. Therefore, it is
perfectly suited to study dark matter on all scales. Moreover, the theoretical basis
of lensing is very simple. For all practical purposes we can use the ray approximation for the description of light propagation. In this limit the rays correspond to null
geodesics in a given gravitational field.
In this section we present an introduction to gravitational lensing that should help
the reader to absorb the current literature.

5.8.1 Three Derivations of the Effective Refraction Index
In Chap. 2 we already showed in different ways that for almost Newtonian, asymptotically flat situations gravitational lensing theory is just standard ray optics with
the effective refraction index
n(x) = 1 − 2φ(x),

(5.230)

where φ(x) is the Newtonian potential. Let us recall how this result was obtained.
In Sect. 2.7 we saw that for a static metric the spatial path of a light ray is a
F = g /(−g ). For an almost Newtonian situation
geodesic of the Fermat metric gik
ik
00
it was shown in Sect. 5.2 that
g = −(1 + 2φ) dt 2 + (1 − 2φ) dx 2 .

(5.231)

F reduces to Fermat’s princiTherefore, the variational principle for geodesics of gik
ple of ordinary optics



(5.232)
δ n x(λ) ẋ(λ) dλ = 0,

with refraction index (5.230).
The result (5.230) was also obtained in Sect. 2.8 in our study of the geometrical
optics limit. If we insert the eikonal ansatz for the Maxwell field


Fμν = Re fμν eiψ ,
(5.233)
with a slowly varying amplitude fμν and a real rapidly varying ψ, we obtain in
leading order the general relativistic eikonal equation (2.104):
g μν ∂μ ψ∂ν ψ = 0.

(5.234)

For an almost Newtonian situation we can set ψ(x) = S(x) − ωt, and obtain the
standard form (2.111) of the eikonal equation in ray optics with the refraction index
(5.230).

282

Weak Gravitational Fields

We derive (5.234) once more slightly differently (working only with the field
strengths). Write (5.233) in terms of differential forms as
F = f eiψ .
(We omit to indicate that the real part on the right has to be taken.) From dF = 0
we get
df + if ∧ dψ = 0,
and d ∗ F = 0 implies
d ∗ f + i(∗f ) ∧ dψ = 0.
In leading order we can neglect in these equations the differentials of f and ∗f ,
f ∧ dψ = 0,

(∗f ) ∧ dψ = 0.

(5.235)

Taking the interior product i∇ψ of the first equation we obtain
0 = i∇ψ (f ∧ dψ) = (i∇ψ f ) ∧ dψ + f (∇ψ)2 .
Since the second equation in (5.235) is equivalent to i∇ψ f = 0, we see that (5.234)
holds.
We also repeat the Hamilton–Jacobi method for light propagation. The light rays
γ (λ) are the integral curves of the vector field ∇ψ ,


γ̇ (λ) = ∇ψ γ (λ) ,
(5.236)
and are thus orthogonal to the wavefronts {ψ = const}. The integral curves are null
geodesics with affine parameter λ. Indeed, γ̇ is a null vector because of (5.234):
g(γ̇ , γ̇ ) = g(∇ψ, ∇ψ) = 0.
Moreover,
∇γ̇ γ̇ = ∇∇ψ (∇ψ)|γ (λ)
vanishes, because the right-hand side is

 ν   μ  1 μ ν
∇ ψ ∇ν ∇ ψ = ∇ ∇ ψ∇ν ψ = 0.
2
A third way of obtaining (5.230) makes use of Exercise 2.25, in which Maxwell’s
equations were written for a general static metric in terms of differential forms E,
B, D and H . If the constitutive relations (2.188), H = ∗B, D = ∗E are written for
the almost Newtonian 3-metric gik ≃ (1 − 2φ)δik , we obtain Maxwell’s equations
in flat spacetime for a medium with
ε = μ ≃ 1 − 2φ.

(5.237)

5.8 Gravitational Lensing

283

Equation (5.230) is thus found again, using Maxwell’s relation:
n=

√
εμ ≃ 1 − 2φ.

Finally, we recall how the ray equation in optics follows from Fermat’s principle (5.232). The latter can be regarded as a Hamiltonian variational principle, with
Lagrangian

L(x, ẋ) = n(x) ẋ 2 .
(5.238)

At this point the qualitative picture sketched in Fig. 5.8 is useful for a first orientation. It shows the typical structure of wave fronts in the presence of a cluster
perturbation, as well as the rays orthogonal to them.
For sufficiently strong lenses the wave fronts develop edges and self-intersections. An observer behind such folded fronts obviously sees more than one image.
From this figure one also understands how the time delay of pairs of images arises:
This is just the time elapsed between crossings of different sheets of the same wave
front. Since this time difference is, as any other cosmological scale, depending on
the Hubble parameter, gravitational lensing provides potentially a very interesting
tool to measure the Hubble parameter. So far, the uncertainties of this method are
still relatively large, but the numbers fall into a reasonable range.

For a point mass M located at the origin of the transversal plane, Σ(ξ ) is equal

where n is the unit outward normal to the disk. The last equality just gives (5.250).
(One also can obtain this result by introducing polar coordinates in (5.248) and
working out the angular integration, but the above derivation is much simpler.)
We shall study axisymmetric lens models in more detail later, but proceed now
with general lenses.

that (5.253) holds also in cosmology.
It is convenient to write (5.251) in dimensionless form. Let ξ0 be a length parameter in the lens plane (whose choice will depend on the specific problem), and let
η0 be the corresponding scaled length in the source plane, η0 = (Ds /Dd )ξ0 . We set

but like hTklT of a weak gravitational wave in the TT gauge (see Sect. 5.3).
Without proof we remark that κ > 1 (Σ > Σcrit ) somewhere implies that for
certain source positions there are multiple images. (For a proof see Sect. 5.4.3 of
[24].) This condition is, however, not necessary.

5.8.4 Alternative Derivation of the Lens Equation
We give here another derivation of the basic equations (5.248) and (5.253) that can
be generalized to a cosmological situation (see [152]). By making use of the notation

in the Fig. 5.10, the differential equation for a light ray ξ = ξ (θ , ζ ) (θ denotes the
observing angles) is, to first order in the Newtonian potential:

(Note that dζ /ds = 1, up to quadratic terms in the small ξi .)


 
 

G ζ, ζ  = ζ − ζ  θ ζ − ζ  ,
(5.265)
we transform (5.264) into an integral equation,

 
ξ (θ , ζ ) = ζ θ − 2
dζ  ζ − ζ  ∇ ⊥ φ ξ θ , ζ  , ζ  .

Here, the first term is a solution of the homogeneous equation, which would describe
the light ray without deflection. Clearly,
d
ξ (θ , ζ ) = θ .
dζ ζ =0

(5.267)

To first order in φ, we can replace the argument in ∇ ⊥ φ on the right-hand side of
(5.266) by the unperturbed ray and obtain the explicit solution

5.8.5 Magnification, Critical Curves and Caustics
Next, we show that the magnification μ, that is, the ratio of the flux of an image to
the flux of the unlensed source, is given by
μ=

1
.
| det Dϕ|

(5.276)

5.8 Gravitational Lensing

291

In order to derive this result, we recall a simple but important fact from ray optics.
Consider a ray L and any two points along the ray and construct areas dA1 and
dA2 normal to the ray at these points. Let dE1 = dE2 be the energy of all rays
passing through both dA1 and dA2 during the time dt. Since
dE1 = Iν1 dA1 dt dΩ1 dν1 ,

dE2 = Iν2 dA2 dt dΩ2 dν2 ,

where dΩ1,2 is the solid angle subtended by dA2,1 at dA1,2 , and because dΩ1 =
dA2 /R 2 , dΩ2 = dA1 /R 2 (R denotes the distance between dA1 and dA2 ), we obtain
Iν1 dν1 = Iν2 dν2 .

(5.277)

If there is no frequency shift, the specific intensity is thus constant along a ray
Iν = const.

(5.278)

This holds also for gravitational light deflection by localized, nearly static lenses,
because this does not introduce an additional frequency shift between source and
observer, beside the cosmological one.6 Now, the flux of an image of an infinitesimal
source is the product of its surface brightness I and the solid angle dΩ it subtends
on the sky. From (5.278) we conclude that the magnification μ is the ratio of dΩ
and the solid angle dΩ0 for the undeflected situation. On the other hand dΩ0 /dΩ
is equal to the area distortion of the lens map ϕ, and thus equal to the Jacobian
| det Dϕ|. This proves our claim (5.276). (For a more sophisticated derivation, which
applies also in cosmology, see [24], Sects. 3.4–3.6, (3.81), (3.82) in particular.)
The lens map ϕ becomes singular along critical curves in the lens plane. These
are characterized by
det(Dϕ) = 0

(5.279)

(1 − κ)2 − |γ |2 = 0.

(5.280)

or, using (5.262), by
The caustics are the images of these critical curves.7
In the vicinity of these source points the magnification becomes very large. On
caustics it diverges formally, but this is of no physical significance, because the
magnification remains finite for any extended source (see [24], Sect. 6.4). For a
point-like source, the ray approximation breaks down and we would have to use
wave optics. (One finds a discussion of this in Chap. 7 of [24].)
6 More general argument: Without absorption and scattering processes the distribution function f
for photons satisfies the Liouville (collisionless Boltzmann) equation (for details see Sect. 3.11)

LXg f = 0,
where Xg is the vector field of the geodesic spray. Since the intensity I (ω) is proportional to ω3 f ,
we conclude that I (ω)/ω3 remains constant along null-geodesics.
7 A famous theorem of Sard tells us that these critical values of ϕ form a set of measure zero.

5.8.6 Simple Lens Models
It is now high time to study some simple, but important examples of specific types of
lenses. Although they are simple, they turn out to be very useful to better understand
the lensing phenomenon.

5.8.7 Axially Symmetric Lenses: Generalities
If the lens is axially symmetric, our general lensing equations simplify considerably.
For the deflection angle, this was already shown in Sect. 5.8.2. According to (5.250)
α̂(ξ ) =

tangential critical curve,

(The reasons for this terminology will soon become clear.) The image of a tangential

plane.

and this matrix must have an eigenvector X with eigenvalue zero. For symmetry
reasons, the vector must be either tangential, X = (0, 1), or normal, X = (1, 0), to
the critical curve (which must be a circle). We see readily that the first case occurs
for a tangential critical curve, and the second for a radial critical curve. It turns out
that the radial critical curve consists of folds.
For a tangential critical curve {|x| = xt }, we have by (5.294) and (5.283)
m(xt ) =

 xt

2xκ(x) dx = xt2 .

(5.296)

2ξ Σ(ξ ) dξ = ξt2 Σcrit .

(5.297)

With (5.254) this translates to
 ξt
0

The total mass M(ξt ) inside the critical curve is thus
M(ξt ) = πξt2 Σcrit .

(5.298)

This shows that the average density Σt inside the tangential critical curve is equal
to the critical density,
Σt = Σcrit .

(5.299)

(Correspondingly, κt = 1.) This is one of the reasons for introducing Σcrit .
Equation (5.299) can be used to estimate the mass of a deflector if the lens is
sufficiently strong and the geometry is such that almost complete Einstein rings8
are formed. If θarc is the angular distance of the arc, we obtain numerically
M(θarc ) = π(Dd θarc )2 Σcrit

8 If the source is on the symmetry axis behind an axially symmetric lens it is seen as a ring. There
are beautiful examples where this ideal condition is nearly satisfied. Ring-shaped images are today
called ‘Einstein rings’, but this possibility was already described by O. Chwolson in 1924.

Since Σ(ξ ) = Mδ 2 (ξ ), we then have κ(x) = πδ 2 (x), according to (5.254), and thus
m(x) ≡ 1. The latter equation follows also from (5.281), (5.282) and (5.254). Thus,

Even when it is not possible to see multiple images, the magnification can still
be detected if the lens and source move relative to each other giving rise to lensinginduced time variability in the magnification. This kind of variability is called microlensing. Microlensing was first observed in the multiple-imaged QSO2237+0305
(see [153]). In 1986, Paczyński proposed to monitor millions of stars in the LMC
to look for such magnifications in a fraction of the sources. In the meantime, this
has been successfully implemented. The time scale for microlensing-induced variations is obviously given by t0 = Dd θE /v, where v is a typical virial velocity of the
galactic halo. Numerically

5.8.9 Singular Isothermal Sphere
The so-called singular isothermal sphere is often used as a simple model for the
mass distribution in elliptical galaxies. One arrives at this model by assuming an
ideal isothermal gas law p = (ρ/m)kB T for the equation of state, where ρ is the
mass density of stars and m the (average) mass of a star. The equation of hydrostatic
equilibrium then gives

5.8.10 Isothermal Sphere with Finite Core Radius
Since no analytic solutions of (5.317) without a central singularity are known, the
surface mass density (5.322) is often modified parametrically by introducing a finite
core radius ξc
Σ(ξ ) =

mass density is

2
2 x + xc2

xc := ξc /ξ0 .

(5.332)

With the help of the formulas above, one can easily work out everything one is
interested in. When does the lens produce multiple images? Consider, in particular,
an extended source near y = 0 and discuss the form of the images (arcs and counter
arcs, etc.). In Chap. 8 of [24] other examples are studied.

5.8.11 Relation Between Shear and Observable Distortions
Consider a situation as sketched in Fig. 5.8. Typically, a population of distant galaxies behind the gravitational field of a deflector (galaxy, cluster of galaxies) is observed. Equation (5.263) tells us how the Hessian of the gravitational potential ψ
of the lens (the tidal field) distorts the shapes of galaxy images. However, since
the source galaxies are not intrinsically circular, it is impossible to extract useful
information from individual images (except for giant arcs).
This problem can be circumvented by observing a sufficiently dense sample of
galaxies, because it is reasonable to assume that the ensemble average of the source
ellipticity (precisely defined below) vanishes. Intrinsic alignments, caused for example by tidal fields, are not plausible. (There are also ways to test this hypothesis.)
Under this assumption the (reduced) complex shear can be determined, as we show
next.
Consider an individual galaxy with surface brightness I (θ ) of its image at position θ . With this distribution we define the tensor Qij of second brightness moments.
A useful quantity, characterizing the shape, is the complex ellipticity
ε=

Q11 − Q22 + 2iQ12
.
Tr Q + 2(det Q)1/2

(5.333)

5.8 Gravitational Lensing

301

The linearized lens map Dϕ provides a relation between the observed ε and the
source ellipticity ε (s) (defined in terms of the intrinsic surface brightness). This relation is completely determined by the reduced shear
g(θ ) :=

γ (θ )
,
1 − κ(θ )

(5.334)

and not by γ (θ ) alone. This becomes obvious by writing the linearized lens map
(5.262) as

There are good reasons to assume that the local ensemble average ε (s)  vanishes.
Let us here consider only the case of weak lensing:
κ  1 and g ≈ γ .
Then (5.336) becomes ε ≈ ε (s) + γ and thus γ = ε. This shows that the shear γ
can be measured statistically for weak lensing. On the basis of (5.336) this consideration can be generalized.
Exercise 5.17 Derive the relation (5.336).
Hints Regard Q = (Qij ) as a linear map R2 −→ R2 , and translate this to a linear
transformation of C. Similarly, regard the linearized lens map as the linear transformation
z −→ w = (1 − κ)z − γ z∗ ,

z = θ1 + iθ2 .

The amount of algebra to obtain (5.336) then becomes modest. It is actually simplest
to first derive the transformation law for the following alternative ellipticity

5.8.12 Mass Reconstruction from Weak Lensing
There is a population of distant blue galaxies in the universe whose spatial density
reaches 50–100 galaxies per square arc minute at faint magnitudes. The images of

302

these distant galaxies are coherently distorted by any foreground cluster of galaxies.
Since they cover the sky so densely, the distortions can be determined statistically,
as was shown in the last subsection. Typical separations between arclets are ∼ (5 ÷
10) and this is much smaller than the scale over which the gravitational cluster
potential changes appreciably.
Initiated by an influential paper of N. Kaiser and G. Squires [155], a considerable
amount of theoretical work on various parameter-free reconstruction methods has
been carried out. The main problem consists in the task to make optimal use of
limited noisy data, without modeling the lens. For a review, see [156].
The reduced shear g, is in principle observable over a large region. What we are
really interested in, however, is the mean curvature κ, which is related to the surface
mass density by (5.254).
We first look for relations between the shear γ and κ. Recall that
1
κ = Δψ,

γ1 = (ψ,11 − ψ,22 ) ≡ D1 ψ,
2

γ2 = ψ,12 ≡ D2 ψ,

(5.338)

where

D2 := ∂1 ∂2 .

Note the identity

D12 + D22 = Δ2 .

Hence
Δκ = 2

(5.340)

i=1,2

In the limit of weak lensing this is all we need. If the difference between γ and g
cannot be neglected, we can substitute the reduced shear, given by (5.334), on the
right in (5.341) for γ . This gives the important equation
! 

Δκ = 2
Di gi (1 − κ) .
(5.342)
i

For a given (measured) g this equation does not determine κ uniquely, reflecting a
famous mass-sheet degeneracy (a homogeneous mass sheet does not produce any
shear). For a given g, (5.342) remains invariant under the substitution
κ −→ λκ + (1 − λ),

(5.343)

where λ is a real constant. This degeneracy can be lifted with magnification information.
Equation (5.342) can be turned into an integral equation, by making use of the
fundamental solution

introduced in (5.246). One solution of (5.341) is

κ = 2G ∗

(5.345)

with a real constant κ0 . The most general solution is obtained if κ0 is replaced by any
harmonic function. For physical reasons, this function must, however, be bounded,
and is thus a constant. Replacing again γ by the reduced shear, we obtain an integral
equation for κ. We write this in a different form by noting that
D1 ln |x| =

x22 − x12
≡ D1 ,
|x|4

D2 ln |x| = −

2x1 x2

This expression for the gradient ∇κ in terms of the shear has been translated by N.
Kaiser, [157] into a relation involving the reduced shear.
We proceed as follows. Let K := ln(1 − κ), then
∇K = −(1 − κ)−1 ∇κ.
In addition, we have


∂j γi = −∂j (1 − κ)gi = −(1 − κ)∂j gi + gi ∂j κ,
and thus, with (5.349),
∂1 κ = ∂1 γ1 + ∂2 γ2 = −(1 − κ)(∂1 g1 + ∂2 g2 ) + g1 ∂1 κ + g2 ∂2 κ.

In principle, the gradient of K = ln(1 − κ) is thus observable.
In an ideal world (without measuring errors) Eq. (5.353) (with u given by (5.354)
in terms of the reduced shear) can be solved in various ways. For instance, by taking
the divergence, we get
ΔK = ∇ · u,

(5.355)

inside a domain Ω covered by observations. Taking the scalar product of (5.353)
with the outward unit normal n on ∂Ω, we find for the normal derivative
∂K
= n · u. (on ∂Ω)
∂n

(5.356)

Equations (5.353) and (5.356) constitute a Neumann boundary problem for K,
which determines K up to a constant. There are efficient and fast methods for a
numerical solution of the Neumann problem.
This is not the place to discuss practical difficulties. For this, and further discussion, we refer again to the review [156]. Weak lensing is the most reliable method
to determine the mass distribution of clusters of galaxies. In contrast to other methods, no assumptions on the physical state and symmetries of the matter distributions
have to be made. In particular gravitational lensing allows us to directly investigate
the (projected) dark-matter distribution.

5.8 Gravitational Lensing

305

The power and importance of this method has been beautifully demonstrated with
the analysis of the weak-lensing data for the unique cluster merger 1E 0657-558, the
“bullet cluster”, at redshift 0.296. This cluster has two galaxy concentrations separated by 0.72 Mpc on the sky. Both concentrations have associated X-ray-emitting
plasma offset from the galaxies toward the center of the system. The X-ray image
also shows a prominent bow shock, indicating that the less massive subcluster is
moving away from the main cluster with high speed (about 4700 km s−1 ). This is
to be expected in a merging process, because the galaxies behave like collisionless
particles, while the fluid-like X-ray-emitting intracluster plasma experiences ram
pressure. As a result, galaxies spatially separate from the plasma.
If there would be no dark matter, the gravitational potential would trace the dominant visible matter component, which is the X-ray plasma. If, however, the mass
is indeed dominated by collisionless dark matter, the potential will trace the distribution of that component, which is expected to be spatially coincident with the
collisionless galaxies. The reconstruction of the projected mass density κ from the
weak-lensing data has shown very clearly that the second possibility is realized.
This proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen. The ratio of the
mass in hot gas to the mass in all matter is estimated to be about 1/7. For details we
refer to [161].
Further reading Since the previous edition of this book, the following SAASFEE lecture notes [162] have appeared, that we highly recommend for further study
of gravitational lensing.

The Post-Newtonian Approximation

Il y a seulement des problèmes plus ou moins résolus.
—H. Poincaré (1908)

6.1 Motion and Gravitational Radiation (Generalities)
The study of the motion of multiple isolated bodies under their mutual gravitational
interaction and of the accompanying emission of gravitational radiation is obviously
of great astrophysical interest. The first investigations on this subject by Einstein,
Droste, de Sitter and others were made very soon after the completion of GR. Since
then a vast amount of work has been invested to tackle the problems of motion
and gravitational radiation of isolated systems (for an instructive review see [163]).
For testing GR, and applying it to interesting astrophysical systems, such as binary
systems of neutron stars and black holes, we need analytical approximations and
reliable numerical methods to construct global, asymptotically flat solutions of the
coupled field and matter equations, satisfying some intuitively obvious properties:
The matter distributions should describe a system of celestial bodies (planets, white
dwarfs, neutron stars, . . .), and there should be no relevant incoming gravitational
radiation. It goes without saying that this is a formidable task.
In this chapter we shall only discuss approximation methods that make use of
some small parameters for sufficiently separated bodies. But before starting with
this, we want to address some conceptual issues, in particular the notion of asymptotic flatness. We shall afterward treat in detail only the first post-Newtonian approximation, but an outline of the general strategies of approximation methods will also
be given. The detailed implementations by various groups become—with increasing order—rapidly very complicated. For interested readers some important recent
papers and reviews will be cited. In the final section we shall apply the developed
tools to analyze very precise binary pulsar data.

6 The Post-Newtonian Approximation

6.1.1 Asymptotic Flatness
For the description of an isolated system, like an oscillating star, it is very sensible
to ignore the rest of the universe. Then spacetime should resemble far away from the
matter source more and more Minkowski spacetime. What that exactly means was
finally formulated by R. Penrose in an elegant geometrical manner (see [164]). His
definition of asymptotic flatness emphasizes the conformal structure of spacetime.
Guided by the examples discussed in Sect. 4.8, the following concepts emerged:
Definition A spacetime (M, g) is asymptotically simple, provided all null geodesics
are complete and (M, g) can conformally be embedded into a Lorentz manifold
(M̃, g̃) such that the following holds:
(i) M is an open submanifold of M̃ with smooth boundary ∂M =: I .
(ii) The function Ω in the conformal relation g̃ = Ω 2 g on M can be extended
smoothly to M̃ such that Ω = 0, dΩ = 0 on I .
(iii) The boundary I is the disjoint union of two sets I + and I − with the property that each null geodesic in M has an endpoint in the past on I − and an
endpoint in the future on I + .
An asymptotically simple spacetime is called asymptotically flat, if in addition the
Ricci tensor for g vanishes in a neighborhood of I . This excludes interesting spacetimes with a non-vanishing cosmological constant.
Remarks
1. The unphysical spacetime (M̃, g̃) is to some extent arbitrary, however, not the
boundary of M in M̃. This arbitrariness has no consequence for the physics, because the extension is causally disconnected from the physical spacetime (M, g).
2. The second condition in the definition fixes the behavior of the conformal factor
as I is approached from M.
3. The third property should be regarded as a completeness condition that is, however, not always satisfied. We know, for example, that for the Schwarzschild
solution there are null geodesics whose spatial orbits are circles outside the horizon. For this reason the notion of weakly asymptotically simple spacetimes has
been introduced, by requiring that such a spacetime is isometric to an asymptotically simple spacetime in a neighborhood of I . This generalization is important
for spacetimes with black holes.
4. The concepts introduced above make no use of Einstein’s field equations. It appears plausible that there is a large class of solutions of the field equations which
satisfy Penrose’s condition of asymptotic flatness. To prove this is exceedingly
difficult, but it is now known that this is the case for Einstein’s vacuum equations
in a neighborhood of null infinity (see [165]).
Apart from such existence questions, there is also a more practical aspect that
should be mentioned. The translation of the field equations by H. Friedrich, [167] to

spacetime of the conformal
approach. The “horizontal”
lines correspond to a foliation
by hypersurfaces that have

(hyperboloidal surfaces)

what he called the conformal field equations for the unphysical spacetime may turn
out to be important for numerical studies of gravitational radiation. One of the reasons is that the asymptotic structure can be calculated since I is within a bounded
domain of the unphysical spacetime (see Fig. 6.1). For an excellent introduction and
review of the potentially powerful numerical method based on the conformal field
equations see [166]. A lot of work remains to be done to develop the numerical
algorithms.

6.1.2 Bondi–Sachs Energy and Momentum
If a spacetime is asymptotically flat one can define beside the ADM four-momentum
(introduced in Sect. 3.7) also a second four-momentum which represents the energy
and momentum remaining in the system after radiation has been emitted. Unlike the
μ
ADM four-momentum PADM , which remains constant, this so-called Bondi–Sachs
μ
μ
four-momentum PBS is a function of a retarded time.1 PBS is defined in terms of an
asymptotic (topological) 2-sphere integral at large null separations.
To illustrate the difference of the two concepts, imagine an isolated initially stationary source which suddenly emits a burst of gravitational radiation. Consider
first a spacelike hypersurface Σ which intersects the source during its quiescent
state and the corresponding ADM four-momentum as defined in (3.209), in terms
1 This is a function (like u in Sect. 4.8.1) whose level surfaces are null hypersurfaces opening up

toward the future.

hypersurface Σ used to

four-momentum

2 ⊂ Σ at spatial infinity. (This can be
of an integral of a 2-form over a sphere S∞
regarded as a vector in the tangent space at i 0 .) Suppose a later spacelike hypersurface intersects the source during or after its active phase. Since all the previously
emitted radiation will intersect this hypersurface, one expects that the later ADM
energy and momentum have not changed, which is indeed the case. If we want to
measure the mass loss of the source, we should “bend up” the later hypersurfaces
such that the already emitted radiation remains in the past, i.e., never intersects it.
We should, however, not bend the surface such that it eventually becomes timelike,
because then radiation emitted in the future of the intersection of the hypersurface
with the source will intersect it further out, and so would contribute twice to the
mass. It is therefore clear that we should bend the hypersurface such that it becomes
null at far distances. The hypersurfaces then approach a cross section S on I + (on
the unphysical spacetime). Draw such hypersurfaces in Fig. 6.1 or see Fig. 6.2.
There are various 2-forms for the 2-sphere integrand which lead to the same
μ
energy and momentum. For PBS an integrand involving the connection coefficients
and certain components of the Weyl tensor was given in a classical paper by Bondi,
Van der Burg and Metzner, [168]. It is, however, much more convenient to use an
expression in terms of spinors since this has become the basis of a relatively simple
μ
μ
proof of the positive energy theorem for PBS . The same is true for PADM , and one
can even use the same two-form for both quantities. This will be described in detail
later in Chap. 9, but we indicate the construction already here.
First, we consider the ADM four-momentum. Let χ be a two-component lefthanded Weyl spinor relative to an orthonormal coframe {θ μ }, which is on the hypersurface Σ asymptotically constant:

χ = (0)χ + O(1/r),
(0)χ being a constant spinor. Consider the Nester two-form

ω = iχ † σ ∧ ∇χ,

σ := σμ θ μ ,

with σμ = (1, σ ), σ being the Pauli matrices, and perform the integral of ω over the
2 bounding Σ at spacelike infinity. We shall see that this is proportional
2-sphere S∞

to PADM · lμ , where (0)lμ is the null covector (0)χ † σμ (0)χ . Precisely, we have (see
Sect. 9.1)

It is natural to use the same formula for PBS , except that we integrate over a
2-sphere at large distances along an asymptotic null cone of constant retarded time.
(There is actually a slight difference; the notion of an “asymptotically constant” has
to be adapted to the different setting.) It turns out (see [169]) that one indeed obtains
in this way the original Bondi–Sachs momentum. Moreover, the following version
of the positive energy theorem can be proven with the same technique (references
are given in Chap. 9).
Positive Energy Theorem Let Σ be a non-singular spacelike hypersurface which
asymptotically approaches a null cone of fixed retarded time. If the dominant energy
μ
condition is satisfied, then PBS is a future directed timelike or null vector. Furtherμ
more, PBS = 0 if and only if the spacetime is flat in a neighborhood of Σ .
μ

μ

The close similarity of the formulas for PADM and PBS facilitates a derivation of
the connection between the two momenta (see [170]), and the Bondi–Sachs massloss-formula (see [168]) is recovered. This formula shows that the energy radiated
μ
away is always positive. Thus (0)lμ PBS is a decreasing function of retarded time,
but stays non-negative because of the positive energy theorem. (Note that (0)l μ is
past-directed.)
We shall give a detailed proof of the positive energy theorem in Chap. 9. The required spinor analysis in GR will also be developed there (see Appendix of Chap. 9).

6.1.3 The Effacement Property
Analytical approximations for describing systems such as radiation-reaction driven
inspiral of compact binaries (neutron stars or black holes) are based on the smallness
of the ratio v/c, where v is a typical relative velocity. This slow motion approximation allows in the near zone an expansion in powers of 1/c of the field equations.
On the other hand, in the radiation zone (far zone) spacetime is approximately flat
and the field equations can be expanded in powers of Newton’s constant G. In some
approaches it is also assumed that the field is everywhere weak, so that—using the
virial theorem—(v/c)2 ∼ GM/R ∼ p/ρ  1, where R is a typical size of the system of sources. A priori this excludes compact objects with strong field regions.
However, in GR—as in Newton’s theory—there is a drastic reduction of the influence of the internal structure of the bodies on the external motion from a priori
estimates. It is this “effacement” property2 which also allows to reduce the problem
of motion of the centers of mass of N bodies to the problem of motion of N pointmasses, subject to ordinary differential equations of celestial mechanics that involve
effective masses (and spins) of the bodies.
2 This term is due to Brillouin and Levi-Civita.

312

6 The Post-Newtonian Approximation

We repeat here an intuitive argument given in [163] for the “effacement property”. Suppose that each body of the system is spherically symmetric when isolated.
Gravitational interactions between the bodies will induce tidal distortions with ellipticity (see Exercise 2.2)
ε∼

where L is characteristic linear dimension of the bodies and R a typical separation
between them. The corresponding tidally induced quadrupole moments ∼ εML2
lead to structure dependent interbody forces ∼ GεM 2 L2 /R 4 (see (4.54)). Compared to the main Newtonian forces ∼ GM 2 /R 2 these are by a factor ∼ εL2 /R 2 ∼
(L/R)5 times smaller. This is very small for compact bodies for which L ∼ GM/c2 ,
so that L/R ∼ GM/c2 R. We conclude that structure dependent forces are of order
(GM/c2 R)5 = O(c−10 ) relative to the dominant Newtonian forces.
We shall come back to the “point-mass limit” in connection with the first postNewtonian approximation.
One of the key issues is to combine the two expansions in the near plus induction
zone and the far field region to arrive at a global (approximate) solution that links the
asymptotic behavior with the structure and motion of the sources. There are several
strategies to achieve this. A few remarks about these will be made in Sect. 6.7.
But let us now turn to the simplest problem, namely to the first post-Newtonian
approximation, which is the first step in all approximation schemes. (Einstein was
the first who used this approximation when he calculated the perihelion motion of
Mercury in November 1915.)

6.2 Field Equations in Post-Newtonian Approximation

is much smaller than 1. From the results of Sect. 5.2 we expect that in the first postNewtonian approximation we should keep in the expansions of the metric components in powers of ε

At the moment, this should be considered as a reasonable ansatz, which has to be
justified by showing that it leads to consistent solutions of the field equations. We
shall see that a consistent post-Newtonian limit requires determination of g00 correct

obtained as a solution of the “reduced” field equation that is obtained after imposing

equation does not imply T ;β = 0. This matter equation has to be imposed as an
additional equation. Below we show that it implies the gauge condition (6.11a). (The

6.4 Point-Particle Limit
In GR it is important to use for the matter distribution a continuum (fluid) model.
Point masses are not compatible with the field equations because of their nonlinearities. As is well-known, the point-particle limit is already a fundamental problem in electrodynamics. The coupled system of Maxwell and Lorentz equations for
3 The term ∂ 2 φ/∂t 2 does not contribute to M because it equals − 1 ∇ · (∂ξ/∂t) (see (6.35)), and
4

hence vanishes upon integration.

6.4 Point-Particle Limit

323

a system of point particles is mathematically ill-defined. For distributional charge
and current densities the electromagnetic fields are distributions. In particular, their
values at the positions of the point charges are not defined, and this causes wellknown problems when back-reactions have to be taken into account (infinite self
energies). For a careful discussion of this issue, that includes also recent contributions, see [23].
If the matter sources are described by a perfect fluid, the matter equation
αβ
T ;β = 0 imply in particular the basic equations of post-Newtonian hydrodynamics. (A detailed derivation and discussion can be found, for example, in [171] and
[172].) This continuum form of the equations of motion is, however, not what we
need to describe post-Newtonian celestial mechanics. For such problems the sizes
of the celestial bodies are much smaller than the orbital separation and this allows
us to approximate the partial differential equations of the continuum description by
a system of ordinary differential equations for the centers of mass which involve
only a few moments (effective mass, spin, . . .) of the bodies. A rigorous way to
achieve this in GR is not easy. It is instructive to perform the transition from a fluid
description to a “point-particle” formulation first in Newtonian theory. In [163] this
is done in two different ways. We repeat here a method that has been adapted to GR
by L. Blanchet, T. Damour and coworkers.

This result shows that the equations of motion (6.67) contain, up to order (L/R)2 ,
only the centers of mass and the masses.

Now we turn to the calculation of the dominant force Fmon
(6.71) we can again choose any surface S containing the position za , but no zb ,
b = a, because the integral does not depend on S if this property is satisfied. We

naturally let S shrink toward za . However, since tmon becomes singular at za , we
have to be careful in taking this limit. Following the treatment in [163], we introduce
a complex regularization φαmon of φ mon defined by

Replacing φ mon in (6.72) and (6.71) by (6.73) leads to well-defined quantities even
at za if Re α > 3. Indeed, since

In [173] T. Damour has generalized this method to GR. It turned out that it can
efficiently be used for higher order approximations (see [174]).

6.5 The Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann Equations
Since the post-Newtonian field and fluid equations resemble the basic Newtonian
equations (6.56)–(6.58), it should not be necessary to extend the discussion of the
last section. Instead, we shall formally work with point particles. In the first Newtonian approximation there is no danger that something goes wrong. In higher orders
point particles should, however, be avoided.
4 Note that since the prefactor in (6.80) approaches zero as α −→ 0, only an infinitesimal neighborhood of za contributes to the integral.

6.6.1 Gyroscope in Orbit Around the Earth
As a first application of (6.144) we consider a gyroscope placed in a circular orbit
about the Earth. We need the potential ξ of the rotating Earth. For this we note that a
system which is at rest and spherically symmetric, but rotates with angular velocity
ω(r), has the momentum density

6.7 General Strategies of Approximation Methods
It has been realized since quite some time that the leading candidate sources of detectable gravitational waves are radiation-reaction driven inspiral of binary systems
of compact objects. For the detection and interpretation of signals from such systems theoretical template waveforms of high accuracy are needed. In particular, the

6.7 General Strategies of Approximation Methods

341

evolution of the orbital frequency or phase must be known with a precision well
beyond the leading-order prediction of the quadrupole formula (see (5.155)). This
challenge has been taken up by several groups.
In this section we make a few remarks about the general procedure of the various
ongoing attempts. It would be out of place for a textbook like this to go into any
further details, because of the enormous complexity of the calculations. These are
well documented, and we shall give some references to the recent literature.
We describe now schematically the main steps that are common to all approximation schemes. (Spacetime indices are dropped, and we use units with G = c = 1.)
1. Impose four gauge conditions which we write symbolically as
Γ [g] = 0.

(6.162)

(The harmonic gauge condition (3.246) is often used.) Within the gauge class
(6.162) Einstein’s equations
G[g] = 8πT [mA ; g],

(6.163)

where mA denote the matter variables, are then equivalent to the “relaxed” (or reduced) system, which no longer implies ∇ · T = 0 and can be solved (iteratively)
for arbitrary matter variables. (For the harmonic gauge conditions this reduced
system played an important role in our discussion of the initial value problem in
Sect. 3.8. We come back to this below.) We write the reduced equations as
Ĝ[g] = 8πT [mA ; g].

(6.164)

2. Solve the reduced field equations (6.164) in some iteration scheme that provides
a sequence of approximate metrics g (N ) [mA ] as functionals of matter variables,
obeying the “right” boundary condition (no incoming radiation).
3. Impose afterward for g (N ) [mA ] the gauge condition
Γ g (N ) [mA ] = 0.

(6.165)

If the matter variables mA and the (N − 1)-iterated metric g (N −1) are used to
determine T (N −1) , then (6.165) is equivalent to
∇ (N −1) · T (N −1) = 0,

(6.166)

where ∇ (N ) denotes the covariant derivative belonging to g (N ) . (For the postNewtonian approximation we saw that in Sect. 6.2.) The matter equations (6.165)
and (6.166) describe for a perfect fluid the motion of the sources. (In general we
have to add further matter equations.)
4. Perform a point-mass limit. We showed in detail how this can be done for the
lowest Newtonian approximation. It seems to us that in high orders there is not
yet a satisfactory procedure that would also allow to determine finite-size or
structure-dependent terms in an unambiguous fashion. The equations of motion
are now known to order (v/c)4 beyond Newtonian theory, and the gravitational
radiation reaction effects have been computed at orders (v/c)5 and (v/c)7 .

342

6 The Post-Newtonian Approximation

After this general outline we want to become more specific.
As already indicated, a popular choice is to impose the harmonic gauge condition
(3.246). Expressed in terms of
√
(6.167)
hαβ := ηαβ − −gg αβ
this reads
αβ

h

,β = 0.

(6.168)

Using the Landau–Lifshitz form (3.216) of Einstein’s field equations, and imposing
(6.168) we obtain the relaxed field equations
hαβ = −16πGτ αβ ,

(6.169)

where  is the flat spacetime d’Alembertian, and the source τ αβ is the pseudo-tensor
τ αβ = (−g)T αβ +

(6.173)

Since we used (6.168) to arrive at (6.169) the latter equation does not imply
αβ
T ;β = 0, as was already emphasized earlier. This equation follows only when the
gauge condition (6.168) is imposed on solutions of (6.169). Indeed, Einstein’s field
equation is then also satisfied, and
T

αβ
;β = 0

(6.174)

follows as a result of the Bianchi identity. Equations (6.168) and (6.169) also imply
τ

If (6.168) is imposed, the last equation is equivalent to

(−g) T αβ + tLL ,β = 0.

(6.175)

(6.176)

6.7 General Strategies of Approximation Methods

343

At this point different strategies have been chosen by the main groups of workers.
We begin with the work of C. Will and collaborators (see [175] and [176]), that is
conceptually easy to understand.
The relaxed field equation (6.169) has on the right-hand side the second derivaαβ
tive term −h ,μν hμν that one would naturally put on the left-hand side, thus changing the principal term and thus modifying the propagation characteristic from the
flat null cones. It would, of course, be desirable to work with the null cones of the
curved spacetime, but for explicit calculations this is not suitable. For an iterative solution of the relaxed field equation it is useful to write this in the form of an integral
equation, imposing an outgoing boundary condition:
hαβ = 4Gret ∗ τ αβ .

(6.177)

Here Gret is the retarded flat spacetime Green’s function, normalized as
Gret = −4πδ (4) .
Explicitly,


h (t, x) = 4
αβ

τ αβ (t − |x − x  |, x  ) 3 
d x.
|x − x  |

(6.178)

The iteration procedure naturally begins by putting hαβ = 0 in τ αβ . The righthand side of (6.178) then gives us the first iterated 1 hαβ as a retarded integral of
T αβ (familiar from the linearized theory of Chap. 5). When substituted into τ αβ
we obtain the second iteration 2 hαβ , and so on. The matter variables mA and the
(N − 1)-iterated field N −1 hαβ are used to determine N −1 T αβ and N −1 Λαβ , thus
αβ
αβ
αβ
αβ as a functional
N −1 τ [N −1 T ;N −1 h ]. The retarded integral gives then N h
of the matter variables. If matter is modeled as a perfect fluid, the matter equations
in the N -th order are obtained from N ∇β (N T αβ ) = 0, where N ∇β denotes the covariant derivative belonging to the N th iterated field. On the other hand, the N -th
iterated gravitational field as a function of spacetime is obtained by solving the matter equations N −1 ∇β (N −1 T αβ ) = 0. These are equivalent to the N -th iterated gauge
αβ
conditions N h ,β = 0. (In one direction this is obvious; see also Sect. 6.2.)
The integration over the past flat spacetime null cone is handled differently, depending on whether the field point is in the far zone or the near zone. In the radiation
zone one can perform an expansion in powers of 1/|x|, in a multipole expansion,
as is familiar from electrodynamics. The leading term in 1/|x| is the gravitational
wave form detected with interferometers (for example). On the other hand, the field
in the near and induction zone is obtained by performing in (6.178) an expansion in
powers of |x − x  | about the local time t, yielding potentials that go into the equation
of motion.
Now the following circumstance has in the past often been a source of trouble.
Since the source τ αβ contains hαβ itself, it is not confined to a compact region. Because of this there is no guarantee that all the integrals in the various expansions are
well-defined. Indeed, in earlier attempts at some point divergences always showed

344

6 The Post-Newtonian Approximation

up, in spite of a continuum matter model, simply as a consequence of the nonlinearity of Einstein’s equations. The “Direct Integration of the Relaxed Einstein
Equations”, called DIRE by Will, Wiseman and Pati (see [175]), splits the integration into one over the near zone and an other over the far zone, and uses different
integration variables to perform the explicit integrals over the two zones. It turns out
that all integrals are convergent.
The DIRE approach assumes that gravity is sufficiently weak everywhere, also
inside the bodies. In order to apply the results also to systems with neutron stars or
black holes, one relies on the effacement property discussed earlier. It is very reasonable to argue that if the equations of motion are expressed in terms of the masses
and spins (ignoring tidal forces), one can simply extrapolate the results unchanged
to the situation where fields in the neighborhood of the bodies are strong.
The mass-point limit is performed in [176] on the basis of a somewhat unphysical continuum model, but this should determine correctly all contributions to the
equations of motion that are independent of the internal structure, size and shape of
the bodies.
We add very few remarks about other approaches. The post-Minkowskian
method of Blanchet, Damour and Iyer is roughly this: First, Einstein’s vacuum
equations are solved in the exterior weak field zone in an expansion in powers of
Newton’s constant, and asymptotic solutions in terms of a set of formal, time dependent, symmetric and tracefree multipole moments are obtained. Then, in a near zone
within one characteristic wavelength of radiation, the equations including the material sources are solved in a slow motion approximation (expansion in powers of 1/c)
that yields both equations of motion for the bodies, as well as a set of source multipole moments expressed as integrals over the “effective” source, including both
matter and gravitational field contributions. Finally, the solutions involving two different sets of moments are matched in an intermediate overlap zone, resulting in a
connection between the two sets of moments. In the matching process a regularization method is introduced to define integrals involving contributions of gravitational
stress-energy with non-compact support which are not a priori well-defined.7 As
a result one obtains the exterior multipole moments as integrals over the source,
and also the radiation reaction forces acting inside the source. The calculations confirmed the expectation that the reaction force corresponds to the energy-momentum
flux carried away by the waves to infinity. (For an extensive review we refer to
[174].)
A third method, championed by G. Schäfer [177], is based on the ADM Hamiltonian formalism of GR, and has some advantages. At the third post-Newtonian level,
the use of distributional sources leads to badly divergent integrals which cannot unambiguously be regularized. At the time of writing it is not yet clear how to get an
unambiguous point-mass limit (see [178]).

7 The method is similar to the one used in Sect. 6.4.

6.7.1 Radiation Damping
As a concrete and important result of all this, we quote the final equations of motion
at the 2.5th post-Newtonian level (some higher orders are now also known).

These dissipative terms lead in particular to a secular change of the orbital period.

periastron) the following time dependence

the previous result (5.202) (for details see, e.g., [179, 180]). The derivation along
the lines sketched above is, however, much more satisfactory (although far more involved). Secular changes of other orbital parameters (eccentricity, semi-major axes)
can also be computed.

6 The Post-Newtonian Approximation

6.8 Binary Pulsars
At several occasions we have compared general relativistic effects with observational data of the binary radio pulsar PSR 1913+16.8 In the present section this
marvelous binary system of two neutron stars will be discussed in detail, and we
shall also mention the results for other similar binary pulsar systems. Since the last
edition of this book the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039, the most relativistic binary
pulsar known, led to several independent stringent tests of GR.

6.8.1 Discovery and Gross Features
Almost 40 years ago, J. Taylor and R. Hulse discovered, in a systematic search for
new pulsars, the first binary radio pulsar (PSR B 1913+16) that appears to have been
exquisitely designed as a laboratory for GR. (Beside the discovery paper [181], we
refer once more to the Nobel prize lectures by the two authors [128] and [129].)
The nominal period of the pulsar is 59 ms. This short period was observed to be
periodically shifted, which proved that the pulsar is a member of a binary system
with an orbital period Pb ≃ 7.75 hours. With Kepler’s third law
Pb =

0.116(a/R )3/2
days,
[(m1 + m2 )/M ]1/2

(6.183)

where m1 , m2 are the two masses and a the semi-major axis, and reasonable masses
(e.g., m1 ≈ m2 ≃ 1.4M ), one concludes that the orbit is not much larger than the
Sun’s diameter.
Correspondingly, the velocity of the pulsar is about 10−3 c and it moves through a
relatively strong gravitational field (about 100 times stronger than the gravitational
field of the Sun near Mercury). These numbers show that several special and general
relativistic effects should be observable—a goal that has been explored since 1974
with increasing accuracy. It turned out that the Hulse–Taylor pulsar is one partner of
a “clean” binary system of two neutron stars, each having approximately 1.4 solar
masses M (see Fig. 6.3). In addition, PSR B 1913+16 behaved very well all the
time, for it has not made any discontinuous jumps (glitches) nor generated noise
since being discovered.
In September 1974 Hulse and Taylor had already obtained quite an accurate
radial velocity curve from the periodically changing pulse arrival rate due to the
Doppler shift, and were thus able to determine five Keplerian parameters [181].
Since this is the first order step of a much more sophisticated pulse arrival time
8 The following readily identifiable nomenclature is used for pulsars: The prefix PSR (abbreviation
of “pulsar”) is followed by a four-digit number indicating right ascension (in 1950.0 coordinates).
After that a sign and two digits indicate degrees of declination. If the pulsar is a member of a binary
system, this is sometimes indicated by the letter B after the prefix PSR.

analysis, to be discussed later, we show how this is done. (This tool will also be
used in Sect. 8.7, when we shall present the current evidence for stellar-mass black
holes.)
We use the notation indicated in Fig. 6.4 for the description of the pulsar orbit.
The z-axis is along the line of sight, and the unit vector N is normal to the orbit
plane. The angle i between these two directions is known as the inclination angle
of the orbit. Another important line, called the line of nodes, is the intersection of
the orbit plane with the plane perpendicular to the line of sight. There are two points
on the line of nodes at which the orbit intersects the (x, y)-plane; the point at which
the mass enters from below into the upper hemisphere is known as the ascending
node. The angle Ω in Fig. 6.4 is the longitude of the ascending node, a time-honored

348

name. Furthermore, the angle ω is the argument of the periastron, and ϕ is called
the true anomaly.
The five astronomical elements i, Ω, a, e and ω play an important role in celestial
mechanics. As origin of the coordinate system x, y, z we choose the center of mass
of the two bodies. The corresponding triad is denoted as {ex , ey , ez }. Let K be a unit
vector in the direction of the ascending node,
K = cos Ωex + sin Ωey .

(6.184)

Then {K, N ∧ K, N } form another orthonormal triad, whose first two vectors lie in
the plane of the pulsar orbit. From Fig. 6.4 one easily sees that
N = N , ex ex + N , ey ey + N , ez ez
= sin i sin Ωex − sin i cos Ωey + cos iez .

(6.185)

Let x 1 (t) = r1 x̂ 1 (t) be the orbit of the pulsar (an index 1 always refers to the
pulsar and the index 2 to its companion). Obviously,
x̂ 1 = cos(ω + ϕ)K + sin(ω + ϕ)N ∧ K.

(6.186)

Inserting (6.184) and (6.185) gives, with θ := ω + ϕ,
x 1 = r1 (cos θ cos Ω − sin θ sin Ω cos i)ex
+ (cos θ sin Ω + sin θ cos Ω cos i)ey
+ sin θ sin iez .

(6.187)

In particular, the component z1 of x 1 along the line of sight is given by
z1 = r1 sin(ω + ϕ) sin i.

(6.188)

For the angular dependence of r1 we have for the Kepler problem
r1 =

a1 (1 − e2 )
,
1 + e cos ϕ

(6.189)

where e is the eccentricity and a1 the semi-major axis of the pulsar orbit. We recall
that e and the semi-major axis a of the relative motion are related to the total energy
E and the angular momentum L of the system by

An early velocity curve for PSR B 1913+16, determined by Taylor and Hulse, is
shown in Fig. 6.5. From this one can read off the orbital period Pb . Note that the expression in the square bracket of (6.195) oscillates in the interval [−1 + e cos ω, 1 +
e cos ω]. Hence, one can immediately determine the amplitude V1 as well as e cos ω,
and thus the time dependence of the function cos(ω + ϕ). The latter can be transformed to a periodic function of the eccentric anomaly u, defined by

where t0 is a reference time of periastron passage. From the knowledge of cos(ω +
Ae (u)) and of e cos ω, we can then also determine e, ω and t0 . So we obtain the five
Keplerian parameters
{Pb , a1 sin i, e, ω, t0 }.
The inclination angle i remains undetermined. This will change when general relativistic effects will be included. We shall see that we will then also be able to determine the individual masses, and these turn out to be close to the Chandrasekhar
mass.

r1 = a1 (1 − e cos u).

(6.200)

From the shape of the radial velocity curve Hulse and Taylor noticed very
soon that the orbit is highly eccentric (e ≃ 0.62). The current very accurate values for the five Keplerian parameters at the reference time t0 are listed in Table 6.1
(Sect. 6.8.11).

6.8 Binary Pulsars

It was early suggested that the Hulse–Taylor pulsar might offer the unique possibility to test the predicted secular decrease of the binary period due to a loss of energy in the form of gravitational waves. As we saw in Sect. 5.5.4 the period change
is predicted by GR to be
Ṗb ≃ −2.4 × 10−12 ,

(6.201)

for m1 ≃ m2 ≃ 1.4M . Thus the change of the period per period should be about
6 × 10−8 s. Therefore, the number of periods after which the change is 100 times
(say) the long term measuring accuracy of 20 µs for the arrival times is found to
be about 3 × 104 . This large number is reached after roughly 20 years of timing
observations. That was indeed the time it took Taylor and coworkers to arrive at an
accurate (∼ 1%) test of the predicted value for Ṗb .
We conclude this introduction by emphasizing an important reason why the binary Hulse–Taylor pulsar has become an ideal testing ground for GR. In this twobody system there are regions of very strong gravitational fields. The characteristic
measure of the field strength GM/(c2 R) becomes about 0.2 at the surface of a neutron star (see Chap. 7), which is close to the maximum of 0.5 at the horizon of a
(spherically symmetric) black hole. Pulsars in neutron star binaries provide the best
known laboratories for experimental tests of GR in the radiative and strong field
regimes.

6.8.2 Timing Measurements and Data Reduction
Pulsars are remarkably stable natural clocks. Mainly due to magnetic dipole radiation the period Pp of the rotating magnetized neutron star increases. For PSR
1913+16 the first time derivative Ṗp is very small, but accurately measured: Ṗp =
8.62713(8) × 10−18 . The pulsar is thus almost as precise as the best atomic clock.

6.8.3 Arrival Time
What is measured are the pulse arrival times at the telescope over a long period of
time. Since PSR 1913+16 is one of the weakest pulsars (≈ 0.7 mJy at 1400 MHz),
Taylor and coworkers used for their observations the large 305 m spherical reflector
of the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Background noise, propagation effects in
the interstellar medium and the steep radio frequency spectrum limit accurate pulsar
timing observations to the one-decade frequency interval ≈ 300 MHz–3 GHz.
Individual pulses are weak and have a complicated profile, but averaging over
several minutes leads to a relatively regular mean-pulse profile. This is then fitted
by the method of least squares to a long-term standard template, thereby yielding
an effective pulse arrival time. All timing measurements since February 1981 have

352

6 The Post-Newtonian Approximation

uncertainties not greater than 20 µs. Because the estimated uncertainties of individual times of arrival are subjected to errors, daily average values of uncertainties
are taken and then scaled by the known dependence of telescope gain and system
noise temperature on the zenith angle. The observatory’s local time standard is corrected retroactively to the universal coordinated timescale (UTC), using data from
the Global Positioning Satellites (GPS). The observational results are so accurate
that an unambiguous assignment of pulse numbers is possible, despite the fact that
some of the observations may be separated for months or even by several years
(during the middle 1990s upgrade of the Arecibo radio telescope) from their nearest
neighbors. During such observational gaps the pulsar may have rotated through as
many as 107 –1010 turns. For a detailed discussion of the observational procedures
and instrumentation we refer to [182].
The observational arrival times of the train of pulses emitted by the orbiting pulsar contains a wealth of information because this sequence is slightly distorted by
interesting effects.
An uninteresting distortion that has to be removed from the data is the dispersion delay due to the interstellar plasma. This can be determined from the measurements at two frequencies (see Sect. 4.5). The dispersion measure is rather large
(DM = 168.77 cm−3 pc), leading to differential time delays of 70 ms across a typical bandwidth of 4 MHz at 430 MHz. (The observed frequency is Doppler shifted
by the Earth’s motion.) This is more than the pulsar period. For this reason, the dispersion of the signals had to be compensated from the very beginning. The large
dispersion measure shows that PSR 1913+16 is quite far away; the best estimate is
8.3 ± 1.4 kpc.
Besides the almost periodic Doppler modulation which is influenced by general
relativistic effects of the orbital motion, the pulse originating from the vicinity of
the pulsar (strong field region) travels afterward through the relatively weak field
region between the compact objects, and finally through the weak field of the solar
system. The arrival time τNEarth of the N th pulse on Earth depends therefore on
many parameters pi , which include a detailed description of the orbit of the binary
system:
τNEarth = F (N; p1 , p2 , . . .).

(6.202)

In this and the next section we shall work out this timing formula to an accuracy
which matches the observational precision.

6.8.4 Solar System Corrections
The solar system corrections are the same as for the arrival times of an isolated
pulsar. So let us consider such a pulsar at a fixed distant position x p in the weak
gravitational field of the solar system

Let te be the emission time of a radio pulse. The topocentric arrival time (measured by an atomic clock at the radio telescope) will be denoted by τa , and for the
corresponding coordinate time of the metric (6.203) we use the symbol ta . We are
interested in the difference τa − te = (τa − ta ) + (ta − te ). The difference ta − τa is
the so-called Einstein time delay, ΔE , and is obtained as follows.
From (6.203) we get
dτa2 = (1 + 2φ⊕ ) dta2 − (1 − 2φ⊕ ) dx 2⊕ .
Thus to sufficient accuracy

dτa
≃ 1 + φ⊕ − v⊕

where φ⊕ is the Newtonian potential at the position of the telescope at the time ta ,
φ⊕ = φ(x ⊕ (ta )), and v⊕ is the coordinate velocity of the Earth at the same time.
Thus ΔE satisfies

= −φ⊕ + v⊕
.
dta
2

(6.204)

2 can be interpreted as the gravitational redshift and the
The terms −φ⊕ and 12 v⊕
transverse Doppler shift, respectively. The Einstein time delay ΔE is obtained by
integrating (6.204) from some arbitrary initial time, because additive constants do
not matter. In φ⊕ we have to sum over all relevant bodies of the solar system, except
the Earth which gives just an additive constant. Because additive constants depend
on some conventions, we write

ta = τa + ΔE + const.

(6.205)

Note that the Newtonian potential is time dependent, but during the traversal time
of a radio pulse through the solar system, we can neglect the motion of the bodies
(adiabatic approximation).
The coordinate time difference ta − te is, after having corrected for dispersion
effects, given by
 x ⊕ (ta )
ta − te =
(1 − 2φ)|dx|,
(6.206)
xp

where the integral can in sufficient approximation be taken along a straight coordinate path from x p to x ⊕ (ta ). The dominant contribution of (6.206) is equal to
|x p − x ⊕ (ta )|. Let x b be the position of the barycenter of the solar system. Then
x p − x ⊕ (ta ) = (x p − x b ) + (x b − x ⊕ )
≃ |x p − x b | + (x ⊕ − x b ) · n,

354

6 The Post-Newtonian Approximation

where n is the unit vector in the direction from the pulsar to the barycenter. So we
have
 x⊕
φ|dx|.
ta ≃ te + |x p − x b | + (x ⊕ − x b ) · n − 2

It is convenient to introduce the (fictitious) “infinite-frequency barycenter arrival
bary
time” τa
= te + |x p − x b |. This would be the (infinite-frequency) arrival time
at the barycenter of the solar system if its gravitational field could be switched off.
According to the last equation we have for this intermediate quantity
bary

ΔR = −(x ⊕ − x b ) · n

xp

Combining (6.205) and (6.207) we obtain
bary

τa

= τaEarth + ΔR + ΔE − ΔS .

(6.210)

This relation holds, of course, also for binary pulsars, but then the relation between
bary
τa
and te is complicated. In the next section we turn to this relation.
Exercise 6.2 For the Shapiro time delay it suffices to keep the gravitational field of
the Sun. Show that then ΔS is given by
ΔS = −2GM ln(1 + cos ϑ) + const,
where ϑ is the pulsar-Sun-Earth angle at the time of observation, if the eccentricity
of the Earth’s orbit is neglected.

6.8.5 Theoretical Analysis of the Arrival Times
After this reduction there remains the much more difficult task to relate the barycenbary
ter arrival times τa
of the pulses to the “proper time” Te of the emission, measured in the pulsar comoving frame. (An aberration correction, related to the pulsar
model, will be included later.) Once this is established, we obtain the timing formula
(6.202) by using in addition the implicit parametrization of TN by the first few terms
of the Taylor series

where νp = 1/Pp is the pulsar frequency and ν̇p , ν̈p parameterize its secular change
with time.

6.8.6 Einstein Time Delay
As an intermediate time variable we use the coordinate time te of emission of a
pulse. The difference of te and the proper time Te of emission (after an aberration
correction taking into account that the pulsar is a rotating beacon) is obtained as
(6.205). Adapting its derivation to the present situation, we have—up to higher postNewtonian orders—

(6.213)

One might expect that this approximation is not good enough, because of strong
field effects on the surface of the pulsar. In GR these can, however, be absorbed by a
renormalization of Te which is unobservable (see [183]). In view of the “effacement
property” of GR, discussed earlier, this is not so astonishing. Inserting (6.213) into
(6.212), we obtain, up to an irrelevant additive constant (absorbable again in Te ),

This formula survives unchanged if strong field effects are introduced, when m1 and
m2 are interpreted as the Schwarzschild masses.

6.8.7 Roemer and Shapiro Time Delays
In a next step we link te with the coordinate arrival time ta at the barycenter of
bary
the solar system. The latter agrees with τa , apart from a Doppler shift. We use,
as in our treatment of the two-body problem in the post-Newtonian approximation

6.8 Binary Pulsars

357

(Sect. 6.5), a coordinate system satisfying the standard post-Newtonian gauge conditions, such that the barycenter of the binary system is at rest. The relative motion
is then determined by the differential equation (6.106), which is the Euler–Lagrange
equation for the Lagrangian (6.103).
In this coordinate system the barycenter of the solar system is moving with the

(−n is as before the unit vector along the line of sight), and ΔR denotes the Roemer
delay across the orbit
ΔR (te ) = −n · x 1 (te ).

(6.228)

For the latter we must use the post-Newtonian approximation for the orbit.
If v b were constant, the Doppler parameter D would be unobservable. There
is, however, some relative acceleration between the two barycenters that will be
discussed later in Sect. 6.8.11.
Let us now compute ΔS under the assumption of everywhere weak gravitational
fields (see [184]). In GR strong field effects again do not change the result, up to an
irrelevant additive constant. Since the first term in (6.213) simply adds a constant,
we obtain from (6.225)

6.8.8 Explicit Expression for the Roemer Delay
For the Roemer delay we obtain from (6.228) and (6.188)
ΔR (te ) = r1 sin i sin(ω + ϕ).

(6.237)

Here, we have to use the post-Newtonian approximation for the pulsar orbit. But let
(K)
us first work out the Keplerian approximation ΔR . This is immediately obtained
from the previous derivation of (6.232):

(6.238)
ΔR = a1 sin i sin ω(cos u − e) + 1 − e2 cos ω sin u .
Following T. Damour and N. Deruelle (see [185] and [186]), we shall obtain a remarkably similar expression in post-Newtonian approximation. In their first paper
a “quasi-Newtonian” parametric representation of the pulsar motion was derived,
starting from the Lagrangian (6.104). Since this is autonomous and invariant under
spatial rotations one has the usual energy and angular momentum integrals. In terms
of polar coordinates (r, θ ) in the (coordinate) plane of the orbit, the equations for
the relative motion can then be brought into the form

The quantities Pb , T0 , et , a1 , er , ω0 , k and eθ are all constants. We also note that the
“semi-major axis” a of the relative motion (in an formula analogous to (6.240a)) is
a = (M/m2 )a1 .
Using this parametric representation we can write (6.237) as


ΔR (te ) = a1 sin i(1 − er cos U ) sin ω0 + (1 + k)Ae (U ) .

(6.242)

Damour and Deruelle show in Appendix A of [186], making use of some subtle
tricks, that this can be brought to a form similar to (6.238) by introducing a new
eccentric anomaly u. The result is (recall x := a1 sin i)

,
ΔR (te ) = x sin ω(cos u − er ) + 1 − eθ2 cos ω sin u .

where T is, as earlier, the proper time of the pulsar. eT is yet another eccentricity,

In what follows, an eccentricity e without an index means that it belongs already
to a small (relativistic) correction and can thus be replaced by any eccentricity introduced above, e.g., by eT of Eq. (6.244).
Before proceeding with our theoretical discussion, we show an observational result. From (6.210), (6.219) and (6.227) is clear that the sum ΔR + ΔE + ΔS as a
function of orbital phase is measurable. The result for PSR 1913+16 obtained in
1988 is shown in Fig. 6.6. Note the high precision, illustrated by the lone data point
with 50000σ error bars.

6.8.9 Aberration Correction
Pulsars are rapidly rotating strongly magnetized neutron stars. In a manner still not
completely understood very narrow beams of radio waves are emitted from the regions of the magnetic poles, precessing around the rotation axis. If one (sometimes
both) of these beams happen to be aligned such that they sweep across the Earth,
we see them as the characteristic pulses from a pulsar. The effect is very similar
to that of a lighthouse. The pulsar phase is the angle Φ describing the direction in
longitude of the emitted beam. As a function of the pulsar proper time T , we have
according to (6.211)

6 The Post-Newtonian Approximation

The orbital motion of the pulsar around the center of mass of a binary system
leads to an aberration effect: The direction n the observer receives light differs from
the direction n in which it was emitted in the pulsar comoving frame. To order v 1 /c
the relation between n and n is given by
n − n = −v 1 + (v 1 · n)n.

(6.249)

The unit vector n precesses around the spin axis erot . The tangential component of
n − n along this precession orbit is
 erot ∧ n
 
erot ∧ n
= −v 1 ·
.
n −n ·
|erot ∧ n|
|erot ∧ n|

(6.250)

This corresponds to an “aberration angle” δΦA of the pulsar phase given by δΦA ·
|erot ∧ n| = right hand side of (6.250), thus
δΦA = v 1 ·

n ∧ erot
.
(n ∧ erot )2

(6.251)

The corresponding aberration delay is (see (6.248))
ΔA =

δΦA
.
2πνp

(6.252)

The proper time T in (6.248) is related to the proper time Te of emission by
T = Te − ΔA .

(6.253)

Combining (6.219), (6.226) and (6.253), we obtain
bary

Dτa

= T + ΔR + ΔE + ΔS + ΔA .

(6.254)

Together with (6.210) we arrive at our main goal
τaEarth + ΔR + ΔE − ΔS = D −1 (T + ΔR + ΔE + ΔS + ΔA ).

(6.255)

As emphasized earlier, a constant D could be absorbed in a rescaling of the units
of time, and is thus unobservable. We therefore set D = 1, but we shall later come
back to the effect of a secular drift of D that is not always negligible. The aberration
parameters A, B, introduced in Expercise 6.3, could be absorbed into redefinitions
of T0 , x = a1 sin i, e, δr and δθ (see [186]), but this would lead to apparent secular
changes of the observed values of x and e. It has also been shown in [186] that δr
could be reabsorbed in a change of the spin phase of the pulsar, thereby introducing
small changes in the observed values of the pulsar rotational parameters which need
not concern us.

6.8.10 The Timing Formula
Before collecting the results of the previous discussion, we have to include the effect
of gravitational radiation damping. This induces secular changes of the Keplerian
parameters Pb , x and e. The secular change Ṗb modifies Eq. (6.244):

(6.256)

where by definition Pb is a constant, the orbital period at epoch T0 . The factor 1/2
in the last term comes from integrating the instantaneous orbital frequency [Pb +
P˙b (T − T0 )]−1 to obtain the orbital phase.
Collecting our results, we arrive at the following timing formula of Damour and
Deruelle: A pulse received on Earth at topocentric time τ Earth is emitted at the time
T in the comoving pulsar frame given by
T = τ Earth − t0 −

Obviously, the splitting into the various Δ terms in (6.257) is gauge dependent,
nevertheless this helps the intuition.
The five Keplerian parameters {Pb , T0 , e, ω0 , x} are constants (for simplicity, we
neglect here the secular variations of e and x). The set of post-Keplerian parameters
{ω̇, γ , Ṗb , r, s, δθ }

6 The Post-Newtonian Approximation

are in principle separately measurable (in this list we could include the secular
changes ẋ and ė), while the set
{δr , A, B}

(6.261)

is not separately measurable, because they can be absorbed by suitable redefinitions
of the other parameters. The proper pulsar time T is related to the pulsar phase by
(6.248).
So far the timing formula holds for a broad class of gravity theories. In
this Damour–Deruelle (DD) model, the six post-Keplerian parameters (6.260) are
treated as free parameters in a fit to observational data.
The general relativistic expressions for (6.260) and (6.261) have all been determined, and are (in general units) given by:

At this point the following is important: Seven parameters are needed to fully
specify the dynamics of the two-body system (up to an uninteresting rotation about
the line of sight). Therefore, the measurement of any two post-Keplerian parameters,
beside the five Keplerian ones, allows the remaining ones to be predicted. Thus, if
one is able to measure P post-Keplerian parameters then one has P − 2 distinct tests
of GR (or of alternative relativistic gravity theories). Realistically, for some systems
the first five of the set (6.260) can be measured (δθ is difficult to be determined), in
which case one has (potentially) three independent tests. In the next section we shall
discuss the current situation.

Solution Start from Eq. (6.186)

Proceeding as in the derivation of (6.195), we find

where


S(u) = sin ω + Ae (u) + e sin ω,

C(u) = cos ω + Ae (u) + e cos ω.

By definition of the polar angles λ, η, we have

6.8.11 Results for Keplerian and Post-Keplerian Parameters
The (phenomenological) parameters appearing in the timing formula are extracted
from the set of pulse arrival times by calculating the expected times of emission
{TN } for the pulse numbers {Nj } from (6.256)–(6.259), and then minimizing the
weighted sum of the squared residuals with respect to all parameters to be determined. Details of the procedure are described in [187] and [188].
Several thousands of pulse arrival times for PSR B 1913+16 have been recorded
at Arecibo Observatory since the discovery of the pulsar in 1974. These data, especially the ones since 1981, determine the five Keplerian parameters {Pb , x, e, T0 , ω0 }
and ω̇, the largest post-Keplerian parameter, very accurately, as can be seen from Table 6.1. Note, in particular, the large value of ω̇ (4 degrees per year), in comparison
to the 43 per century of Mercury. In a hundred years the binary pulsar orbit rotates
more than 360 degrees. It took some time to arrive at a precise value of the Einstein
parameter γ , which is now known to better than 0.1%.—All quoted results are from
[189].

6.8.12 Masses of the Two Neutron Stars
Assuming that we can ignore possible non-relativistic contributions to the periastron shift, such as tidally and rotationally induced effects caused by the companion
(to be discussed later), we can use the measured values for ω̇ and γ to determine
the masses of the two stars. Indeed, (6.262b) and (6.262c) show that these postNewtonian parameters have different dependencies on the pulsar and companion
masses. This is a very interesting astrophysical application of GR, and provides the
most precise values of neutron star masses. The result for the Hulse–Taylor system
is
m1 = 1.4408 ± 0.0003M ,

m2 = 1.3873 ± 0.0003M .

(6.265)

6.8 Binary Pulsars

367

It is highly significant for theories of late stellar evolution and neutron star formation
in gravitational collapse that the two masses are close to the critical Chandrasekhar
mass (for more on this, see Chap. 7).

6.8.13 Confirmation of the Gravitational Radiation Damping
We now come to the most important result of Taylor and collaborators. Knowing,
beside the Keplerian parameters, also the masses of the binary system, GR predicts
the secular change Ṗb as a result of gravitational radiation damping (see (6.262d))
to be
ṖbGR = (−2.40247 ± 0.00002) × 10−12 .

(6.266)

This compares very well with the observed value of Table 6.1, but for a more precise comparison it is necessary to take into account the small effect of a relative
acceleration between the binary pulsar system and the solar system, caused by the
differential rotation of the galaxy.
Remember that we absorbed the Doppler factor D by a rescaling of the units
of time. In particular, the ratio of the observed to the intrinsic period is given by
Pbobs /Pbintr = D −1 . To first order we have (see (6.227))

the Sun and the pulsar.
Damour and Taylor estimated (6.269) using data on the location and proper motion of the pulsar, combined with the best available information on galactic rotation
(see [191]). A recent reevaluation gave (see [189])
(Ṗb )gal = −(0.0125 ± 0.0050) × 10−12 .

(6.270)

Subtracting this from the observed Ṗb leads to the corrected

This beautiful consistency among the measurements is shown in Fig. 6.7, in which
the bands in the mass plane are shown that are allowed by the measurements of ω̇,
γ and Ṗb if GR is valid. As one can see, there is a single common overlap.
Another way to show the agreement with GR is to compare the observed phase
of the orbit with the theoretical prediction as a function of time. The orbit phase is
given according to (6.256) by

Since, on the other hand, the periastron passage time TP satisfies Φb (TP ) − T0 =
2πN , where N is an integer, this will not grow linearly with N . The cumulative
difference between periastron time TP and N Pb should vary as
1
(TP − T0 ) − N Pb ≃ Ṗb Pb−1 (TP − T0 )2 .

Figure 6.8 shows the data and the GR prediction of this. The gap during the middle
1990s was caused by a closure of Arecibo for upgrading.
This beautiful agreement also provides strong evidence that the binary system
PSR B 1913+16 is “clean”. Since the companion mass is close to the Chandrasekhar
limiting mass for white dwarfs, we are most probably dealing with a binary neutron

star system. Such stars are so compact that we can completely ignore tidally or
rotationally induced Newtonian effects on the orbit. (These effects were estimated in
Sect. 6.1.) Early after the discovery of PSR 1913+16 one could not a priori exclude
that the companion was a helium star or a rapidly rotating white dwarf, but this
has become more than unlikely. (For an early discussion of this issue see [16] and
[192].)
No relativist had even dreamed of a system like the eight-hour binary Hulse–
Taylor pulsar. The high expectations held shortly after its discovery have been surpassed during the long detailed study by Taylor and his associates. GR has passed
new tests with complete success.

6.8.14 Results for the Binary PSR B 1534+12
Since 1990 other massive binary pulsars were discovered. Of particular interest
for testing GR is the binary system PSR B 1534+12 (see [193]), a bright, relatively nearby pulsar, also with a neutron star companion. Its pulses are significantly
stronger and narrower than those of PSR B 1913+16, allowing more precise timing
measurements. Because the orbit, with Pb ≃ 10.1 hours, is nearly edge-on as viewed
from the Earth, the Shapiro parameters r and s are more easily measurable. This led
to new experimental tests.
The latest results, presented in [194], are based on an 11.5-year data set taken
with the Arecibo 305 m telescope. Over recent years a new data acquisition system (see [195]) was used that fully removes the dispersion effects of the interstellar

medium from the signal. The accuracy of the pulse arrival times has also been improved.
The five post-Keplerian parameters {ω̇, γ , Ṗb , r, s} can be measured as described
before and are listed in the DD column of Table 6.2, taken from [194]. If these agree
within the uncertainties with the general relativistic values (6.262b)–(6.262f), we
obtain bands in the mass plane shown in Fig. 6.9 (note that ω̇, γ are known very
accurately). Leaving out for a moment Ṗb , the remaining four bands intersect in a
common region. The best mass estimates of the two neutron stars are
m1 = 1.3332 ± 0.0010M ,

m2 = 1.3452 ± 0.0010M .

This provides a precise test of GR which makes use of non-radiative parameters
only. The general relativistic values of the five post-Keplerian parameters (6.262b)–
(6.262f) for these two masses and the Keplerian parameters are given in numbers
in the “DDGR” column of Table 6.2. Note the excellent agreement with the DD fit
parameters.
Unfortunately, the observed Ṗb has a galactic contribution that is dominated by
the last term in (6.269), due to the transverse velocity of the pulsar binary. This
involves the pulsar’s distance, which can only roughly be estimated on the basis of
the dispersion measure. Using a model of Taylor and Cordes (see [196]) for the free
electron distribution of the Galaxy, one finds the small distance d = 0.7 ± 0.2 kpc.
Including also estimates of the other terms in (6.269), the following value for (Ṗb )gal
was obtained in [194]:
(Ṗb )gal = (0.037 ± 0.011) × 10−12 ,
where the uncertainty is dominated by the one in the distance.
The intrinsic rate of orbit decay is
(Ṗb )obs − (Ṗb )gal = (−0.174 ± 0.011) × 10−12 .
On the other hand one obtains from (6.262d)
(Ṗb )GR = −0.192 × 10−12 .
The two values differ by some 1.7 standard deviations.
We can, however, easily bring the two quantities into agreement, by changing the
pulsar distance to d = 1.02 ± 0.05 kpc (68% confidence limit). This is valuable, but
a precise test of (Ṗb )GR would have been more interesting.
Binary pulsar data have also been analyzed in the framework of alternative
theories of gravity, in particular for a broad class of scalar tensor theories (see

In spring 2003 a very interesting double neutron star system was discovered [199].
It turned out that the companion of the previously discovered 22-ms pulsar PSR
J0737-3039 [200] is also a radio pulsar with a spin period of 2.7 s. This first example
of a double-pulsar binary system has several favorable properties which promised
to make it a superb laboratory for testing GR. It has a short orbital period of 2.4 hr,
narrow pulse features, and an almost maximal inclination angle. Since both neutron
stars are pulsars, the ratio R of their two masses can be determined in a theoryindependent way. According to Sect. 6.8.1, R is a ratio of two Keplerian parameters:
R :=

aB sin i xB

(6.273)

Precision timing observations since the discovery of the system, have been published in [201]. These led to four independent strong-field tests of general relativity. The amazing agreement of the Shapiro parameter s with the predicted value
within 0.04% is by now the most precise test of GR. The other Shapiro parameter r is known within 5%. The value of Ṗb is measured with a precision of 1.4%
to Ṗb = −1.252 × 10−12 . The remarkable results are shown in graphical form in
Fig. 6.10 and numerically in Table 6.3 (taken from [201]).

(SB stands for spin-orbit). The measurement made use of secular changes in the
light curve and pulse shape, which were determined by monitoring the roughly 30 s
long eclipses of A that are caused by the blocking rotating magnetosphere of B at
superior conjunction (see [203]). The result is given in Table 6.3, and also shown in
Fig. 6.10.
The binary pulsar data are all in complete agreement with the predictions of GR,
and also provide stringent tests for alternative (extended) theories of gravity.

White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars

With all reserve we suggest the view that supernovae represent the transitions from ordinary stars to neutron stars, which in their final stages consist of extremely closely packet
neutrons.
—W. Baade and F. Zwicky (1934)

7.1 Introduction
The bewildering variety of normal stars covers the mass range
0.07M  M  60 to 100M .
Masses smaller than the lower limit cannot become sufficiently hot to ignite nuclear
burning and stars more massive than 60 to 100 solar masses would be unstable. The
many different and sometimes brilliant evolutionary paths lead to the following few
end-products of stellar evolution (see Fig. 7.1).
1. Low-mass stars with masses M  4M evolve into white dwarfs. White dwarf’s
progenitor stars often undergo relatively gentle mass ejection (forming “planetary nebulae”) at the end of their evolutionary lifetimes and thereby reduce
their mass below the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs of about 1.4M . The
slowly cooling white dwarf has a size approximately equal to that of the Earth.
The Sun will become a white dwarf in about 5 × 109 years. We understand the
structure of these objects in great detail.
2. It is possible that some stars in the range 4 to 8M ignite carbon under very
degenerate conditions and are completely disrupted in some sort of supernova.
(This is a very delicate problem for numerical simulations.)
3. For stars with masses larger than about 11M nuclear fusion proceeds all the
way up to iron. At this point the central core runs into an instability and collapses catastrophically. This comes about as follows: In the last stages of nuclear
energy generation an “iron core” of burned out elements is formed, which has
the structure of a white dwarf. Around this core of iron peak elements an onion

structure is built up as a result of shell burning in various shells. The central
white dwarf-like region finally becomes unstable due to electron capture and/or
photo-disintegration of the iron-peak elements into α-particles. At this point the
core starts to collapse in practically free fall. There are now two possibilities.
(a) For some mass range, neutron star residues with increasing masses of 1.4–
2.0M , say, will be left behind a prompt or delayed supernova explosion.
(b) For sufficiently massive stars, the core will, however, most likely accrete too
much mass to be stable and will then collapse very quickly to a black hole.
In this picture we do not expect a collapse directly to a black hole. A protoneutron star is formed first, which accretes sufficient mass through a stalled
shock until it becomes unstable and undergoes a general relativistic collapse.
It is difficult to say for which mass range of stars this is going to happen, but
we do expect the formation of black holes for some very massive stars. There
may be a million of such stellar mass black holes in our Galaxy.
It is natural that we understand the three final compact stationary end-products
much better than the highly dynamical processes which lead to them. Supernova
events belong to the most complex phenomena physicists have ever attempted to
study. Some important aspects of the physics of supernovas are qualitatively and
even semi-quantitatively understood since a long time. But there is after decades of
intense research aund numerical modeling still no final consensus on the supernova
explosion mechanism triggered by core collapse. The “neutrino-driven mechanism”
remains the most promising candidate. This relies on the neutrino energy deposition
in some regions that revives the outward moving stalling shock. Numerical investigations over many years have demonstrated that a general relativistic treatment is

7.2 White Dwarfs

377

necessary, and that a sophisticated handling of neutrino interactions is also crucial
for the explosion process.1
Compact objects—white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes—are often not
just dead stars. In some cases they are members of close binary semi-detached systems, collecting matter from a normal companion star. This leads to an enormously
rich variety of interesting systems, showing a broad range of fascinating phenomena.

7.2 White Dwarfs
The message of the companion of Sirius when it was decoded ran: ‘I am composed of
material 3000 times denser than anything you have ever come across; a ton of my material
would be a little nugget that you could put in a matchbox’. What reply can one make to such
a message? The reply which most of us made 1914 was—‘Shut up. Don’t talk nonsense.
—S.A. Eddington (1927)

It is very remarkable that the quantum statistics of identical particles found its first
application in astrophysics. In the same year when E. Schrödinger discovered his
wave equation R.H. Fowler realized that “the black-dwarf material is best likened
to a single gigantic molecule in its lowest quantum state” and he developed the nonrelativistic theory of white dwarfs. It was afterward recognized independently by
several people (I. Frenkel (1928), E. Stoner (1930), S. Chandrasekhar (1931) and
L.D. Landau (1932)) that relativistic kinematics weakens the quantum mechanical
kinematic energy (zero-point pressure) to the extent that there is a limiting mass for
white dwarfs.
The existence of a limiting mass for white dwarfs can be qualitatively understood as an immediate consequence of special relativity and the Pauli principle. It is
important to understand this, before going into any quantitative investigation.
Matter in white dwarfs is completely ionized. The Coulomb forces establish local neutrality to a very high degree. For this reason the Coulomb interactions play
energetically almost no role. (Coulomb corrections can be estimated and are on a
few percent level.) The spatial distribution of nuclei and hence their momentum
distribution is much the same as those of the electrons. Therefore, the ground state
energy of a white dwarf with N electrons and NZ nuclei with charge Ze and mass
mZ can be estimated as follows:

According to the Pauli principle each momentum state is occupied at most twice,
corresponding to the two spin values sz = ±/2. In the ground state, i.e., at temperature T = 0, all states with |p| ≤ pF (Fermi momentum) are occupied. The

number of states in the Fermi sphere characterized by |p| ≤ pF is obviously
2 · (4π/3)(pF /3 )/(2π/L)3 . Since this is also equal to the number N of electrons,

7.2.2 Thomas–Fermi Approximation for White Dwarfs
It is not so well-known that the Chandrasekhar theory of white dwarfs is just
Thomas–Fermi theory, whereby the white dwarf is considered as a big “atom” with
about 1057 electrons. Below we show that the famous Chandrasekhar equation is
indeed just the relativistic Thomas–Fermi equation.
For white dwarfs the Thomas–Fermi approximation is ideally justified. The density in these stars is so high (typically one ton per cm3 ) that the electrons can be
treated as an ideal gas in its ground state. Thermal excitations can be neglected, as
we shall soon see. Moreover, Coulomb interactions between the electrons are largely
screened.
The electrons of white dwarfs are moving in a strong gravitational field which is
generated by the nuclei that generate a neutralizing background. Let μe = A/Z be
the average mass number per nuclear charge (≈ 2) of these nuclei, then the matter
density ρ is
ρ = μe mN ne ,

(7.9)

where ne is the electron number density
ne (x) =

1
p 3 (x).
3π 2 3 F

(7.10)

This statistical description is well justified since per cm3 there are in the average
very many electrons, whose states are local plane waves in an almost constant Newtonian potential φ(x). (A Newtonian description of the white dwarf structure suffices completely.) The Fermi momentum pF depends on the local potential φ that
is connected with the Fermi energy εF , the highest energy of the occupied states in
the ground state, as follows

pF2 (x)c2 + m2e c4 + μe mN φ(x) = εF .
(7.11)

380

7

White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars

(Note that the potential energy per electron is μe mN φ.) In equilibrium εF must be
a constant. Otherwise the total energy of all electrons could be lowered by suitable
displacements of electrons. (In the language of statistical mechanics, the Fermi energy is the chemical potential at T = 0.) The self-consistent (mean) field φ satisfies
the Poisson equation
Δφ = 4πGρ

(7.12)

with ρ given by (7.9) and (7.10). Note that

Thus for ρ ∼ 106 g/cm3 the electrons become moderately relativistic (pF ∼ mc).
Since mc2 corresponds to a high temperature of about 0.5 × 1010 K, thermal effects
are indeed small.
We solve the algebraic equation (7.11) for φ and insert the result in (7.12), with
ρ taken from (7.9) and (7.10). With the abbreviation f (x) = pF (x)/me c we obtain

(Note that in reality μe ≈ 2.) This is a fundamental result.
Equations (7.26) and (7.21) give the mass-radius relation for white dwarfs,
which is shown in Fig. 7.2. The compactness parameter GM/Rc2 (half of the
Schwarzschild radius divided by R), measuring the importance of GR, is for typical
white dwarfs about 10−4 . Therefore, the Newtonian approximation is well justified.
(General relativistic effects, however, play some role for stability.)—Thanks to several improvements (e.g., better estimates of distances to several white dwarfs with
the Hipparcos satellite) it has become possible to test the theoretical mass-radius
relation. The observational results presented in [205] show that there is good agreement between theory and observations.

7.2 White Dwarfs

383

The classical theory developed in this section is a good starting point for more
accurate white dwarf models. Corrections due to Coulomb interactions can be computed with standard methods for dense electron gases. There are other interesting
aspects, such as:
(a) Effect of neutronization (inverse β-decay) on a white dwarf of homogeneous
composition.
(b) Crystallization of the ion lattice and heat capacity of the Coulomb lattice.
(c) Cooling of white dwarfs, including the effect of neutrino radiation (plasmon
decay into neutrino pairs) at early times.
(d) Nuclear reactions in cold dense matter (so-called pycnonuclear reactions).
For a very readable treatment of these astrophysically relevant issues we refer to
[26].

7.2.3 Historical Remarks
We conclude with some historical remarks related to white dwarfs (for a detailed
account we highly recommend the article [84] by W. Israel). By 1925 it was known
through the work of W. Adams on the binary system of Sirius that Sirius B has the
enormous average density of about 106 g/cm3 . The existence of such compact stars
constituted one of the major puzzles of astrophysics until the quantum statistical
theory of the electron gas was worked out.
On August 26, 1926, Dirac’s paper containing the Fermi–Dirac distribution was
communicated by R.H. Fowler to the Royal Society. On November 3 of that year,
Fowler presented his own work to the Royal Society in which he systematically
worked out the quantum statistics of identical particles and in the process developed
the well-known Darwin–Fowler method. Shortly thereafter, on December 10, he
communicated to the Royal Astronomical Society a new paper with the title “Dense
Matter”. In this work he showed that the electron gas in Sirius B is almost completely degenerated in the sense of the new Fermi–Dirac statistics. This paper by
Fowler concludes with the following words:
The black dwarf material is best likened to a single gigantic molecule in its lowest quantum
state. On the Fermi–Dirac statistics, its high density can be achieved in one and only one
way, in virtue of a correspondingly great energy content. But this energy can no more be
expended in radiation than the energy of a normal atom or molecule. The only difference
between black dwarf matter and a normal molecule is that the molecule can exist in a free
state while the black dwarf matter can only so exist under very high external pressure.

Since Fowler treated the electrons non-relativistically, he found an equilibrium
configuration for every mass (see Exercise 7.1). We have, however, seen that the
momenta of the electrons in a white dwarf are comparable to me c and the electron gas must thus be treated relativistically, leading to a limiting mass. This was
noticed by several authors (mentioned earlier), in particular by S. Chandrasekhar,

384

7

White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars

who discovered the limiting mass for a white dwarf (see [238, 239]). In 1934, Chandrasekhar derived the exact relation between mass and radius for completely degenerated configurations (see [240]; this can also be found in his classic text book [29]).
He concluded his paper with the following statement:
The life-history of a star of small mass must be essentially different from the life-history of a
star of large mass. For a star of small mass, the natural white-dwarf stage is an initial step
toward complete extinction. A star of large mass cannot pass into the white-dwarf stage and
one is left speculating on other possibilities.

This conclusion was not accepted by the leading astrophysicists of the time. A comment by S.A. Eddington contains the following correct conclusion:
Chandrasekhar shows that a star of mass greater than a certain limit remains a perfect gas
and can never cool down. The star has to go on radiating and radiating and contracting and
contracting, until, I suppose, it gets down to a few kilometers radius when gravity becomes
strong enough to hold the radiation and the star can at last find peace.

If Eddington had stopped at this point, he would have been the first to predict the
existence of black holes. However, he did not take this conclusion seriously, and
continues:
I felt driven to the conclusion that this was almost a reductio ad absurdum of the relativistic
degeneracy formula. Various accidents may intervene to save the star, but I want more
protection than that. I think that there should be a law of nature to prevent the star from
behaving in this absurd way.

And here is L.D. Landau (see [206]) in similar vein:
For M > 1.5M there exists in the whole quantum theory no cause preventing the system
from collapsing to a point. As in reality such masses exist quietly as stars and do not show
any such ridiculous tendencies we must conclude that all stars heavier than 1.5M certainly possess regions in which the laws of quantum mechanics (and therefore of quantum
statistics) are violated.

Under the impression of the quantum revolution a few years ago, some people
expected already a new one in the domain of relativistic quantum theory.

7.2.4 Exercises
Exercise 7.1 Consider the non-relativistic Thomas–Fermi theory of white dwarfs,

on the right of this important relation.

the Chandrasekhar mass. Extend this to the Chandrasekhar equation, and reproduce
the graph in Fig. 7.2.

7.3 Formation of Neutron Stars

385

7.3 Formation of Neutron Stars
We already remarked that the central regions of sufficiently massive stars eventually
become unstable. For rather massive stars this instability is induced by photodisintegration of the iron-peak elements to α-particles. The nuclear disintegration of
iron to helium costs a lot of internal energy and reduces the relevant adiabatic index
below a critical value. For stars in the lower of the mass range, electron capture is
a further destabilizing factor (see, e.g., [26]). The result of this is that the dynamic
collapse of the iron-core is unavoidable.
We do not discuss here the physics of the core collapse.2 This is finally halted
when nuclear densities are reached. At these densities the nuclei overlap and undergo a transition to a degenerate nucleon Fermi liquid with strong repulsive forces
at short distances. The equation of state stiffens suddenly and within tenths of milliseconds the inner core rebounds as a unit. This generates a shock with an initial
energy of roughly 5 × 1051 erg. Whether and how this shock wave is capable of
producing mass ejection in the overlying mantle and envelope, is still a burning
question (see, e.g., [84] and [228]).
The initially formed central proto-neutron star does not resemble the final cold
star. It takes tens of seconds of quasi-hydrostatic thermal, structural and compositional readjustments until the residue becomes a strongly degenerate neutron star.
In particular, electron capture deleptonizes the core region. This and other neutrino
processes cool the proto-neutron star very rapidly. In the resulting ‘cold’ neutron
star a β-equilibrium is established. We shall see that in this equilibrium only a few
percent of protons and electrons are present. This scenario for the origin of neutron
stars is strongly supported by the fact that all well determined masses in six double
neutron star binaries have masses in the narrow range 1.36 ± 0.08M . If approximately 10% binding energy is added to this, one comes close to the Chandrasekhar
mass for iron-cores of the progenitor stars.
The predicted cooling through neutrino diffusion over a time scale of several
seconds was dramatically confirmed by the observed neutrino pulse from the famous
supernova 1987A (for a review see [208]).
Neutron stars are so compact that GR has to be used for a quantitative treatment.
In order to see this, let us first estimate the structure of neutron stars in Newtonian
theory using the Thomas–Fermi approximations for the neutrons.3 Masses and radii
are then obtained from our results for white dwarfs in Sect. 7.2.2 by the simple substitutions me → mn (mass of neutron) and μe → 1. In particular, the characteristic
size λ1 in (7.22) now becomes approximately mn /me times smaller:
λ1 =

[206]).

In this treatment one finds that the mass of a neutron star as a function of the central
density reaches a maximum at a finite value of ρc , and then decreases (see Fig. 7.4).
The decreasing branch turns out to be unstable (see Sect. 7.5).
The first model calculations for neutron stars in GR were performed by J.R. Oppenheimer and G. Volkoff in 1939 (see [209]). In this pioneering work the equation of state of a completely degenerate ideal neutron gas was used. In those early
days the effects of strong interactions could not be estimated. Afterward, theoretical interest in neutron stars dwindled, since no relevant observations existed. For
two decades, F. Zwicky was one of the few who took seriously the probable role of
neutron stars as final states of massive stars.
Interest in the subject was reawakened at the end of the 1950s and beginning of
the 1960s. When pulsars were discovered in 1967, especially when a pulsar with a
short period of 0.033 s was found in the Crab Nebula, it became clear that neutron
stars can be formed in type II supernova events through the collapse of the stellar
core to nuclear densities.

7.4 General Relativistic Stellar Structure Equations
We proceed to derive the general relativistic stellar structure equations for nonrotating, static, spherically symmetric (compact) stars. For such stars, the metric
has in Schwarzschild coordinates the form (see Appendix of Chap. 4)



g = −e2a(r) dt 2 + e2b(r) dr 2 + r 2 dϑ 2 + sin2 ϑ dϕ 2 .

With respect to the orthonormal tetrad
θ 0 = ea dt,

θ 1 = eb dr,

θ 2 = r dϑ,

θ 3 = sin ϑ dϕ

(7.37)

we parameterize the energy-momentum tensor as
T μν = diag(ρ, p, p, p),

(7.38)

where ρ is the total mass-energy density and p is the pressure. Anisotropic stresses
and heat conduction are thus neglected. For the overall structure of compact stars
this is an excellent approximation.
The Einstein tensor corresponding to (7.36) was computed in Sect. 4.1, with the

The reader may verify that—as for the exterior Schwarzschild metric—the other

Equation (7.48) generalizes the hydrostatic equation
−p  =

(7.50)

of the Newtonian theory. The pressure gradient toward the center increases for three
reasons in GR:
(a) Since pressure also acts as a source of a gravitational field, there is a term proportional to p in addition to M(r).
(b) Since gravity also acts on p, the density ρ is replaced by (ρ + p).
(c) The gravitational force increases faster than 1/r 2 ; therefore this quantity is replaced by r −2 [1 − 2GM(r)/r]−1 in GR.
These modifications will lead us to the conclusion (see Sect. 7.9) that an arbitrarily
massive neutron star cannot exist, even if the equation of state becomes extremely
stiff at high densities.
In order to construct a stellar model, one needs an equation of state p = p(ρ). If
this is known the density profile of the star is determined by the central density ρc .
We summarize the relevant equations:

7.5 Linear Stability
An equilibrium solution is physically relevant only if it is stable against small perturbations. The existence of instabilities can generically be established with a linear
analysis, thanks to general theorems. One thereby considers time-dependent perturbations and expands all basic equations about the equilibrium solution, keeping only
linear deviations. For conservative systems the time dependence of the perturbations
can be separated. The frequencies in the time-dependent factor e−iωt are determined
by eigenvalue equations and must be symmetrically distributed under reflection in
the real and imaginary axis.
In the hyperbolic case (no real frequencies) the Grobman–Hartman theorem implies that the system is also non-linearly unstable. Linear (spectral) stability is only

7.5 Linear Stability

393

possible when all frequencies are real (oscillatory time-dependence for each mode).
This need, however, not imply stability, as can be demonstrated by simple finitedimensional Hamiltonian systems (for instance of two non-linearly coupled harmonic oscillators).
To summarize, spectral instability (some frequencies have negative imaginary
parts) generically implies instability, but a linearly stable equilibrium state may well
be non-linearly unstable. It is well-known from Hamiltonian mechanics that a stability proof can be very difficult, even for low dimensional systems, as for instance for
the two equilateral solutions of the restricted three body problem. In what follows
we shall only investigate linear stability.
For spherically symmetric configurations, one considers as a first step only radial
perturbations, which are also adiabatic. Since hydrodynamic time scales are usually
much shorter than the characteristic times for energy transport, this is reasonable. In
this case, one obtains an eigenvalue problem4 of the Sturm–Liouville type for ω2 ,
since the equations for adiabatic perturbations are time reversal invariant (there is
no dissipation). The equilibrium is linearly stable provided ω02 > 0 for the lowest
mode frequency ω0 .
One can often find sufficient criteria for instability by making use of the
Rayleigh–Ritz variational principle and simple trial functions.
Sometimes it is possible to decide, simply by examining the equilibrium solution,
whether or not it is stable against radial, adiabatic pulsations. Here we only prove
the proposition below and refer the interested reader to [229].
We consider cold matter. For a given equation of state, there is then a oneparameter family of equilibrium solutions. We choose the central density ρc as the
most suitable parameter.
Proposition 7.1 At each critical point of the function M(ρc ), precisely one radial adiabatic normal mode changes its stability properties; elsewhere, the stability
properties do not change.
Proof Suppose that for a given equilibrium configuration a radial mode changes
its stability property, i.e., the frequency ω of this mode passes through zero. This
implies that there exist infinitesimally nearby equilibrium configurations into which
the given one can be transformed, without changing the gravitational mass or energy.
Hence if ω passes trough zero we have M  (ρc ) = N  (ρc ) = 0. According to the next
Proposition, N  (ρc ) = 0 already follows from M  (ρc ) = 0.

7.6 The Interior of Neutron Stars
We do not have an accurate quantitative understanding of neutron stars, because
the physics involved is very complex and uncertain. Before discussing some special
aspects—especially the equation of state—we give a brief qualitative overview of
the interior of neutron stars.

7.6.1 Qualitative Overview
Figure 7.3 shows a cross section through a typical neutron star. The outer crust is
found underneath an atmosphere of just about 1 cm thickness. (Estimate the pressure
scale height for an ideal gas.) It consists of a lattice of completely ionized nuclei and
a highly degenerate relativistic electron gas. In this layer the density ρ increases to
about 3 × 1011 g/cm3 ; its thickness is typically a few hundred meters. The conductivity in the crust is very high which implies a very long lifetime (about 107 years)
of the magnetic field. It should be mentioned in this connection that field decay is
a very controversial subject. At least in some cases there seems to be practically no
field decay of neutron stars. There are, for instance, binary pulsars with white dwarf
companions which are cool and hence very old (several 109 years). The inner crust
starts at ρ ∼ 3 × 1011 g/cm3 and is somewhat less than 1 km thick, at which point the

396

7

White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars

Fig. 7.3 Interior structure of
neutron stars

density has reached the value ρ ∼ 2 × 1014 g/cm3 . In addition to increasingly neutron rich nuclei (determined by β-equilibrium) and degenerate relativistic electrons,
it contains also a degenerate neutron gas, which may be superfluid. The reason is
that the interaction between neutrons at distances larger than 1 fm is attractive. It is
difficult to calculate the energy gaps reliably, because they depend exponentially on
the strength of an effective interaction which is determined by the influence of the
background liquid in which the neutrons move.
The crustal neutron superfluid is most probably crucial for an understanding of
glitches and post glitch behavior of pulsars. The vortices of the neutron superfluid
are pinned to the lattice of neutron-rich nuclei, because the free energy per unit
length of a vortex line varies with location and brings them to preferred locations.
(Note that the nuclei in the lattice have dimensions and spacing comparable to the
correlation length ξ .) Glitches are probably the result of a sudden unpinning of
vortex lines. The intrinsic pinning provides a natural reservoir of both angular momentum and rotational energy. Released catastrophically, and suddenly, it can give
rise to a glitch in the pulsar rotation; released gradually, through the creep of vortex
lines, it provides a source of energy dissipation.
The creep of pinned vortex lines following a glitch provides a natural explanation
of post glitch behavior of pulsars. The vortex creep theory is a phenomenological
description of the post-glitch behavior in terms of thermal motion of vortex lines in
an inhomogeneous medium of pinning centers. As a result of the Magnus force the
vortex lines move radially outward, which leads to a transfer of angular momentum
from the superfluid to the crust. This generates also frictional heating which can
affect the thermal emission of pulsars.

7.6 The Interior of Neutron Stars

397

The inner fluid or core in Fig. 7.3 consists mainly of neutrons, which are possibly superfluid in a certain density domain. In order to maintain β-equilibrium a
few percents of the nucleons have to be protons, which are neutralized by electrons
and muons. The proton fraction might be crucial for the cooling of neutron stars. In
regions where the protons are superfluid, they are obviously also superconducting.
With standard BCS theory one can estimate that the protons form a type II superconductor.
The central core is a region within a few kilometers of the center, which may contain in addition to hyperons, a pion condensate, and, for some of the more massive
stars, a quark phase near the center. Indeed, the neutrons begin to touch when their
density is nt ≃ ((4π/3)rN3 )−1 , where rN is an effective nucleon radius. In terms of
nuclear matter density nt /n0 ≃ 1.4/rN3 , where n0 ≃ 0.17 fm−3 and rN is measured
in fm (Fermi). Thus, one might expect the transition to quark matter to occur somewhere in the range (3–10)n0 .—Clearly, the astrophysics of neutron stars is very rich
and involves several major fields of physics.

7.6.2 Ideal Mixture of Neutrons, Protons and Electrons
This brief overview shows that the physics of the interior of a neutron star is extremely complicated. A major problem is to establish a reliable equation of state. In
order to get a feeling for the orders of magnitude involved, let us first consider an
ideal mixture of nucleons and electrons in β-equilibrium.

We readily see from this that for nn > 0, the Fermi momentumof the electrons is larger than the maximum momentum of an electron pmax ≃ Q2 − m2e =

Afterward np /nn increases monotonically and approaches the asymptotic value of

As a typical example, we take ρ ≃ mn nn = 0.107ρ0 and find np /nn = 0.013 and
pF,e = 105 MeV/c. Above this density, muons are stable.—Note also that μp  μe
since pF,e = pF,p and thus we have μn ≃ μe .

7.6.3 Oppenheimer–Volkoff Model
The ideal equation of state p(ρ), described implicitly by (7.73a) and (7.73c) was
used in the first general relativistic model calculation by Oppenheimer and Volkoff
in 1939 (see [209]). In Fig. 7.4 the gravitational mass of this model of neutron
stars as a function of the central density ρc is shown. The maximum mass is Mm =
0.71M and is reached at the high density ρm = 4 × 1015 g/cm3 . The corresponding
radius is Rm = 9.6 km. For ρ > ρm the star is unstable according to Proposition 7.1.
A Newtonian stability analysis shows that for ρ  ρm the star is stable since the
adiabatic index is then 5/3, well above the critical value 4/3. Hence, the entire
rising branch in Fig. 7.4 is stable.
To show how Mm and Rm scale with the fermion mass mf , we write the result
as follows
Mm = 0.36M0 ,

Rm = 3.2R0 ,

where
R0 =

(8πGρ0 )1/2

So, we have Mm , Rm ∝ m−2
f and (2GMm )/(Rm c ) = 0.23.
In Fig. 7.4 we also show the result of the semi-Newtonian theory. The relatively
large difference demonstrates that GR is quantitatively important. Since most observed neutron star masses are above 1.3M , they must be supported against gravitational collapse by pressure contributions originating from nuclear forces.

7.6.4 Pion Condensation
We also give a naive argument for the possible existence of a pion condensate. Consider a mixture of protons, electrons, neutrons and pions π − at temperature T = 0
under equilibrium conditions, which imply for the chemical potentials the relations


μe = μn − μ p = μπ
n ←→ p + π − , n ←→ p + e− .
For ideal gases we have μπ = mπ (ideal Einstein condensate) and thus


where x = pF /m. Charge neutrality implies in addition

xn = 0.584,

i.e.,
ρ|π − −threshold = 1.36 × 1015 g/cm3 ≃ 5ρnuc .
This is not far from more realistic calculations. For a discussion of the present status
and references to the literature, we refer to the review [210].
Exercise 7.6 As was discussed in Sect. 4.7.4 there is a mass concentration in the
center of our galaxy of 3 × 106 M within 17 light hours. Consider the hypothetical possibility that this could be a completely degenerated star of non-interacting
fermions (e.g. neutrinos). For which range of fermion masses would this be possible?

7.7 Equation of State at High Densities

401

7.7 Equation of State at High Densities
The equation of state at sub-nuclear densities is reasonably well known (for a brief
review and references, see [211]). Since the densities in the central regions of neutron stars can be almost an order of magnitude higher than the nuclear density
ρnuc ≃ 2.7 × 1014 g/cm3 ≃ 0.16 nucleons/fm3 ,
we need a reliable equation of state at super-nuclear densities. This is a very difficult
problem and large uncertainties remain. Below nuclear densities the nuclear gas is
dilute and one can use perturbative methods. In the relevant region above nuclear
densities we are still far from the asymptotic free region of quantum chromodynamics. Furthermore, quantum chromodynamic lattice calculations are not feasible for the time being. The most useful approaches are still based on a many-body
Schrödinger description, with phenomenological potentials. Before we say more
about this, we briefly discuss another popular approach.

7.7.1 Effective Nuclear Field Theories
In this approach one starts from a local relativistic field theory with baryon and
meson degrees of freedom. Such models have the advantage to be relativistic but
sacrifice the connection to the large body of nucleon-nucleon scattering data. The
coupling constants and mass parameters of the effective Lagrangian are constraint
by empirical properties of nuclear matter at saturation (binding, density, compression modules, symmetry energy). As a starting point one chooses a mean field approximation that should be reasonably good at very high density. In a second step
1-loop vacuum fluctuations are included (relativistic Hartree approximation), and
further refinements have been worked out.
This approach is probably best viewed as a reasonable way of parameterizing the
equation of state. It has, however, a number of drawbacks. For textbook reviews we
refer to [27] and [28].

7.7.2 Many-Body Theory of Nucleon Matter
In this traditional approach one uses two-body potentials which are fitted to nucleonnucleon scattering data and three-body terms whose form is suggested in part by
theory (two-pion exchange interaction) and purely phenomenological contributions,
whose parameters are determined by the binding of few-body nuclei and saturation
properties of nuclear matter. There are systematic improvements in this program.
In the early 1990s the Nijmegen group carefully examined all data on elastic
nucleon-nucleon scattering below the pion production threshold. Nucleon-nucleon

402

7

interaction potentials which fit the data base have been constructed by various
groups. These differ mainly because some of them include non-localities suggested
by boson exchange contributions. This leads to different predictions for the manybody systems, but these are much smaller than those of older models.

is the so-called Argonne V18 (A18) potential, because it consists of sums of 18
operators like σ i · σ j , etc. (see [212]). We shall show below results for neutron stars
based on this potential.
This and other ‘modern’ potentials underbind the triton and other light nuclei and
predict too high equilibrium density for symmetric nuclear matter. To correct this, as
well as for theoretical reasons, one has to include three-nucleon interactions Vij k in
(7.83). Such potentials are constructed by fitting binding energies of light nuclei and
the estimated equilibrium properties of nuclear matter. Some of the results shown
below are based on the Urbana models U-IX (see [213]).
Beside these contributions, some relativistic corrections (so-called boost interactions) have to be included (see [214]). In the graphs shown below, these are denoted
by δV.
There are two main methods to solve approximately the many-body problem. In
the method developed by Brueckner, Bethe and Goldstone the perturbation expansion of the nuclear matter energy is ordered according to the number of independent
hole lines. The other many-body calculations are based on the variational principle,
whereby the energy expectation value is evaluated using cluster expansion. The energies obtained with the two methods are in reasonable agreement at densities below
0.6 fm−3 . However, at higher densities the convergence of the hole line expansion is
expected to deteriorate and the results are significantly below the variational bound.
For more details and references we refer to [210].
The equation of state can be obtained parametrically from the energy ε per
baryon as a function of the baryon number density nB as follows
ρ(nB ) = nB ε(nB ),

p(nB ) = n2B

∂ε
.
∂nB

(7.84)

In Fig. 7.5 we show the result for ε(nB ) based on one of the modern realistic
models for nuclear forces (A18+δV +UIX ∗ ). The increasing difference between the
two curves at large densities shows the importance of three-body interactions (the
star on UIX indicates its modification when the boost interaction δV is included).
The calculations use “variational chain summation methods”.

7.8 Gross Structure of Neutron Stars
Using the result for cold, catalyzed β-stable matter the gross structure of neutron
stars can be calculated. For A18 + δV + UIX ∗ the maximum mass Mm turns out

to be Mm = 2.20M . The corresponding radius is R(Mm ) = 10.1 km and the central baryon density is nc (Rm ) = 7.2 fm−3 . Figure 7.6 shows the density profiles of
2.1M and 1.41M stars. Of great observational interest is the mass-radius relation.
This is plotted in Fig. 7.7. The importance of the boost and three-body interactions
is also shown. For further information we refer the reader to the reviews [210] and
[216].
The mass-radius relation of neutron stars is difficult to test. While a few masses
are known very accurately, observational methods for estimating neutron star radii
are so far not sufficiently accurate to differentiate between realistic equations of
state. Some information comes from X-ray bursts (see Sect. 7.12) or from the thermal emission of quiescent neutron stars in binaries. An interesting case is the nearest known neutron star RX J1856.5-3754, which is non-pulsating and almost thermally radiating. It has been studied with the Hubble space telescope (see [217]).
The distance D has been estimated from parallax measurements with the result:

one obtains the apparent radius R∞ := R/(1 − 2GM/R)1/2 of ≃ 15 km for M =
1.4M . Using also Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, Trümper et al. arrived
at a true stellar radius of 14 km for M = 1.4M [218]. This indicates a stiff equation
of state at high densities.

7.8.1 Measurements of Neutron Star Masses Using Shapiro Time
Delay
Using the effect of Shapiro delay on pulsar arriving times it has become possible to
infer for nearly edge-on binary millisecond radio pulsar systems the masses of both
the neutron star and its binary companion with high precision. In Sect. 6.8.5 we
have seen that the Shapiro delay of pulsar signals determines the companion mass
and the inclination angle (see (6.262f) and (6.262g)). Using in addition the standard
Keplerian orbital parameters (Sect. 6.8.1), both masses are fixed. This method has
now successfully been applied, with the result that neutron stars with masses at least
as high as 2M exist in some binary pulsar systems.
We discuss here briefly the results of [219], based on timing observations of the
binary millisecond pulsar J1614-2230. These show a strong Shapiro delay signature,
because the orbital inclination angle is very close to 90◦ , (sin i = 0.999894(5)).
The companion mass turned out to be (0.500 ± 0.006)M , which implies that the
companion is a helium-carbon-oxygen white dwarf. Most interesting is the high
pulsar mass of (1.97 ± 0.04)M , far higher than all previously precisely measured
neutron star masses. This lower limit for the maximum mass of a (slowly rotating)

7.9 Bounds for the Mass of Non-rotating Neutron Stars

405

neutron star provides a significant constraint for the equation of state, as can already
be seen from Fig. 7.7. A systematic comparison shows that generically equations of
state involving hyperons or boson condensates, that tend to be relatively soft at high
densities, are ruled out. Condensed strange quark matter models are also strongly
constraint. For details, and references, see [219].

7.9 Bounds for the Mass of Non-rotating Neutron Stars
The value of the largest possible mass Mmax of a non-rotating neutron star is interesting for at least two reasons. First of all, it is important for the theory of stellar
evolution. If Mmax were fairly small (≃ 1.5M ) then black holes could be formed
with high probability, as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. Its value also
plays a decisive role in the observational identification of black holes. If one can
find a very compact object which can be shown convincingly not to rotate very fast
and to have a mass which is definitely larger than Mmax , then one has a serious candidate for a black hole. Precisely such arguments have been used to identify some
binary X-ray sources as black hole candidates (see Sect. 8.7).
In view of the large uncertainties of the equation of state for high densities, it
is important to find reliable limits for Mmax . This is what we are going to do next
(see also [137]). We shall assume that for densities less than some given density ρ0
(which may depend on our current knowledge), the equation of state is reasonably
well known; for densities higher than ρ0 , the equation of state will be required to
satisfy only quite general conditions.

7.9.1 Basic Assumptions
We shall make the following minimal assumptions about the matter in the interior
of a non-rotating neutron star:
(i) The energy-momentum tensor is described in terms of the mass-energy density
and an isotropic pressure p, which satisfies an equation of state p(ρ). Stresses,
which may have arisen as a result of the slowing down of the star’s rotation,
are neglected.
(ii) The mass-energy density is positive, i.e., ρ ≥ 0.
(iii) The matter is microscopically stable, i.e., dp/dρ ≥ 0. Since the pressure is
certainly positive at low density, we then have p ≥ 0.
(iv) The equation of state is known for ρ ≤ ρ0 . We may choose for ρ0 a value which
is not significantly below nuclear densities.
It is reasonable to assume that the velocity of sound (dp/dρ)1/2 is smaller than
the velocity of light. A priori one may question this assumption since the sound
velocity is a phase velocity and sound waves propagating through neutron stars are

406

7

White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars

subject to dispersion and absorption. However, if one accepts a fluid description of
matter in a neutron star, then the sound velocity provides the characteristics of the
hydrodynamic equations for acceptable relativistic formulations. Hence, causality
implies dp/dρ ≤ 1.
We repeat the basic equations from Sect. 7.4, since these form the basis for the
following derivations (again G = c = 1). The metric is

where R is the stellar radius, i.e., the point at which the pressure vanishes, and
M = m(R) is the gravitational mass of the star.
Examination of (7.86a) leads one to expect that
2m(r)/r < 1.

(7.88)

The justification of the conclusion is as follows. Let r∗ be the first point at which,
starting from the center of the star, 2m(r∗ ) = r∗ . In a neighborhood of r∗ , the
Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation (7.86a) becomes

where n is the baryon number density. This is an immediate consequence of the first

(7.91)

Thus, if we integrate (7.89) and use the fact that the right-hand side is negative for
r < r∗ , we obtain η(r∗ ) = 0. Examination of (7.90) shows that this is not possible
for a realistic equation of state.
We can also conclude from our assumptions that the density does not increase
with increasing radius. From (7.86a) we obtain for its radial gradient

According to (ii) and (iii), the quantities ρ, p and dp/dρ are positive. The positive
sign of the last factor is a consequence of (7.88) and
m(r) =

 r

4πr 2 ρ dr.

(7.92)

0

We have thus shown that dρ/dr ≤ 0.—This allows us to divide the star into two
regions.
The envelope is the part having ρ < ρ0 and r > r0 , for which the equation of
state is known. The interior region with ρ > ρ0 and r < r0 is called the core. In this
region we assume only the general properties (i)–(iv).
The mass M0 of the core is
M0 =

 r0

4πr 2 ρ dr.

(7.93)

0

Given M0 , the structure equations (7.86a) and (7.86b) can be integrated outward
from r0 . The corresponding boundary conditions are p(r0 ) = p(ρ0 ) =: p0 and
m(r0 ) = M0 . The total mass M of the star is
M = M0 + Menv (r0 , M0 ).

(7.94)

The mass of the envelope Menv can be regarded as a known function of r0 and M0 ,
since the equation of state is known there. We may now obtain bounds for M by the
following strategy:
1. Determine the range of values (M0 , r0 ) which is allowed by the assumptions (i)–
(iv). This range of possible core values will be called the allowed region in the
(r0 , M0 )-plane.
2. Look for the maximum of the function M defined by (7.94), in the allowed region
of the variables r0 and M0 .

408

7.9.2 Simple Bounds for Allowed Cores
One obtains a simple, but not optimal bound for the allowed region as follows: For
r = r0 , we find from (7.88)
1
M0 < r0 .

If the density does not increase with r, then
M0 ≥

(7.97)

A simple numerical example shows that these are not completely uninteresting. If
ρ0 = 5 × 1014 g/cm3 , then Eq. (7.97) gives M0 ≤ 6M and r0 < 18 km.

7.9.3 Allowed Core Region
In order to determine precisely the allowed region for the cores, we investigate the
quantity
ζ (r) = ea(r) ,

(7.98)

which is finite and positive everywhere. The quantity ζ (r) can vanish only at the
center, in the limit in which the pressure approaches infinity. This is a consequence
of (7.86c), which can be integrated inward from the surface, subject to the boundary
condition (7.87c), without encountering a singularity.
One can derive a differential equation relating ζ (r) and m(r) from the structure
equations (7.86a)–(7.86c):

(It is easy to verify that this equation is correct. For a systematic derivation see

not either. Therefore, the right-hand side of (7.99) is not positive. If one introduces

Using the mean value theorem, we conclude

(7.103)

This represents the optimal improvement of (7.95). Together with (7.96), which is
already optimal, Eq. (7.110) determines the allowed region in the (r0 , M0 )-plane for
cores which satisfy the assumptions (i)–(iv). This region is showed in Fig. 7.8.
One finds the largest core mass for the stiffest equation of state, namely, for
incompressible matter with constant density ρ. Even then the mass of the core inside
a radius r0 is limited; otherwise the pressure becomes infinite at the center and
equilibrium is lost.
As long as ρ0 is not significantly larger than nuclear matter density, then p0  ρ0

As an illustration, let us choose ρ0 = 5.1 × 1014 g/cm3 and use an equation of state
due to G. Baym, H.A. Bethe, C. Pethick and P.G. Sutherland given in [230, 231].

We then have p0 = 7.4 × 1033 dyn/cm2 and thus p0 /ρ0 = 0.016  1. Recall that for
nuclear matter the density is given by ρnuc = 2.8 × 1014 g/cm3 . The allowed region

are contours of constant total mass, which is by (7.94) a function of M0 and r0 .
The optimum upper bound is 5M . If one requires in addition dp/dρ < 1, then
one would obtain 3M , instead, which explains why one obtains an upper limit of
approximately 3M for “realistic” equations of state.
The calculation shows that the contribution of the envelope to the limiting mass
is less than 1%. The limit is reached for the maximum value of the core mass. One
can show (see [137]) that this is true as long as p0  ρ0 .

7.10 Rotating Neutron Stars
Most periods of pulsars are in the range 0.25–1 s, but there is also a subclass of millisecond pulsars. The rotation of even the fastest millisecond pulsar PSR 1937+214,
with a rotation period P = 2π/Ω = 1.558 msec is not fast enough to change the
internal structure of the neutron star very much. This should not be surprising in
view of the fact that the Keplerian angular velocity ΩK of a test body around the
equator of a typical 1.4M neutron star is ΩK = (GM/R 3 )1/2 ≃ 0.9 × 104 sec−1 .
If pulsars with Ω  0.8 × 104 s should one day be found this would have stringent
implications for the equation of state for neutron star matter.
For the study of axisymmetric, stationary uniformly rotating neutron stars one
first has to write the field equations in a convenient form. We shall assume that
matter can be described by a perfect fluid
T μν = (ρ + p)uμ uν + pg μν .

(7.114)

As an application of the Frobenius theorem (see DG, Appendix C) we shall show in
Sect. 8.3.1 that spacetime (M, g) splits into a product of two-dimensional orthogonal manifolds
M = Σ × Γ,
where Σ is diffeomorphic to the isometry group R × SO(2) and the metric coefficients in adapted coordinates (t, ϕ, x A ) depend only on the two coordinates x A
of Γ . The coordinates t and ϕ of Σ can be chosen such that the two commuting
Killing fields belonging to the isometry group are k = ∂/∂t and m = ∂/∂ϕ. The
metric splits as


g = gtt dt 2 + 2gtϕ dt dϕ + gϕϕ dϕ 2 + gAB dx A dx B .

(7.115)

Note that the three metric coefficients gtt , gtϕ and gϕϕ have an invariant meaning as
scalar products of the Killing fields:
gtt = k, k,

gtϕ = k, m,

gϕϕ = m, m.

(7.116)

A convenient parametrization is
gtt = −e2U ,

gtϕ = −e2U a,

gϕϕ = e−2U W 2 − e2U a 2 ,

(7.117)

so that
a = gtϕ /gtt ,

2
W 2 = −gtt gϕϕ + gtϕ
.

(7.118)

The coordinates x A of Γ are chosen such that the induced metric is conformally
flat


(7.119)
gAB dx A dx B = e−2U e2k dρ 2 + dζ 2 .

7.10

We are thus led to the Lewis–Papapetrou parametrization


g = −e2U (dt + a dϕ)2 + e−2U W 2 dϕ 2 + e−2U e2k dρ 2 + dζ 2 ,

(7.120)

with the four potentials U , a, W and k that are functions of ρ and ζ . (For the
moment we ignore possible problems connected with ‘ergospheres’, i.e., regions,
where k becomes spacelike.)
The four-velocity u of the fluid is a linear combination of the Killing fields
u = e−V (k + Ωm),

(7.121)

where Ω is the angular velocity of the fluid, assumed to be constant (rigid rotation).
From u, u = −1 one finds that
e2V = e2U (1 + Ωa)2 − Ω 2 W 2 e−4U .

(7.122)

The rigid rotation has restrictive consequences, as we now show. For this we
look at the Euler equations for the ideal fluid that follow from the field equations
(see (2.40)):
(ρ + p)∇u u = −∇p − (∇u p)u.
Here, the last term vanishes for rigid rotation
Lu p = e−V (Lk p + ΩLm p) = 0.
Next we note that for the 1-form u belonging to u the following holds
(Lu u)μ = uν uμ,ν + uν uν,μ = uν uμ;ν + uν uν;μ = (∇u u)μ .
Therefore, the Euler equation reduces to
(ρ + p)Lu u = −dp.
Now we have, using the identity Lf X ω = f LX ω + df ∧ iX ω for a vector field X
and a differential form ω,


Lu u = d e−V ∧ ik+Ωm u + e−V Lk+Ωm u
= −dV ∧ iu u = dV .
Therefore, Euler’s equation becomes simply
(ρ + p) dV = −dp.

(7.123)

But this implies that ρ and p must be functions of V alone. For a given equation of
state ρ = ρ(p) the function p(V ) is determined by the differential equation
ρ(p) + p = −

In Chap. 8 we shall derive in detail the field equations for the potentials in the
vacuum region (a particular solution will be the Kerr metric). In the interior of the
body it is natural to pass to comoving coordinates
ϕ −→ ϕ  = ϕ − Ωt
and all other coordinates unchanged. With respect to these the Killing field k  := k +
Ωm, proportional to u, is just ∂/∂t and is always timelike. This simple coordinate
transformation does not change the Lewis–Papapetrou form (7.120). The role of k
in (7.116) is now taken by k  , hence



e2U := −gtt = − k  , k  = e2V ,
thus U  = V . It is a simple exercise to derive also the other of the following relations:

e2U = e2U (1 + Ωa)2 − Ω 2 W 2 e−4U ,

 
1 − Ωa  e2U = (1 + Ωa)e2U ,
k  − U  = k − U,

(7.126)

W  = W.
These are used to match the interior and the exterior vacuum solutions.
Much of the work that will be done in Sect. 8.3 for rewriting the field equations
in terms of the potentials also applies to the interior of the body. In comoving coordinates the basic equations are given in [220].
The Jena group has developed a code for rotating relativistic stars, based on a
“multi-domain spectral method”, that is of unprecedented accuracy (see [221]). This
has been applied in [222] to a systematic study of uniformly rotating, homogeneous
and axisymmetric fluid bodies. For a review on rotating stars in GR we refer to [223].
A crucial question is how much the maximal mass for stable neutron star configurations increases, compared to the non-rotating case. For a textbook representation
on rotating neutron stars we refer to [224].
Exercise 7.8 Derive the rest of (7.126).

Cooling of Neutron Stars

415

7.11 Cooling of Neutron Stars
When a neutron star is formed in the collapse of a stellar core it is very rapidly
cooled by neutrino radiation. The interior temperature drops to less than 1 MeV
within minutes and to about 109 K within one year. Neutrino emission dominates
the further cooling of the neutron star, until the interior temperature falls to about
108 K, with a corresponding surface temperature of about 106 K. Only then does
photoemission also begin to play an important role.
The cooling curves, i.e., observed temperature as a function of time, depend on
a number of interesting aspects of the physics of neutron stars. It turns out that the
equation of state as well as the mass of neutron stars do not influence the cooling
in a sensitive manner, but the possible existence of a superfluid state of the nucleons plays some role and the existence of a pion condensation or quark phase in the
central region would have dramatic effects. For conventual cooling scenarios neutrino emission dominates the cooling for about 105 years.—We briefly discuss the
dominant neutrino processes.
The so-called standard model of neutron star cooling is based upon neutrino
emission from the interior that is dominated by the modified URCA process:
(n, p) + p + e− −→ (n, p) + n + νe ,

(7.127a)

(n, p) + n −→ (n, p) + p + e− + ν̄e .

(7.127b)

The direct URCA process
n −→ p + e− + ν̄e ,

p + e− −→ n + νe ,

(7.128)

is strongly suppressed in degenerate matter by energy and momentum conservation.
The fermions n, p and e− participating in the process have energies within kT of the
Fermi surfaces. By energy conservation the neutrino and anti-neutrino energies are
then also approximately kT . But the Fermi momenta of the electrons and protons are
small compared with the neutron Fermi momentum and thus the processes (7.128)
are strongly suppressed by momentum conservation.
This is no longer the case when an additional nucleon, which can absorb energy and momentum, takes part in the process, as in (7.127a) and (7.127b). A pion
condensate would have the same effect as such a spectator nucleon.
In order to determine the cooling curves for neutron stars, we need to know both
the internal energy and the luminosity as functions of the internal temperature. We
must also know the relation between interior temperature and surface temperature.
A vast amount of work has been invested over the years in these issues. For an introduction we refer to [16] and [26]. (For extensive recent reviews on most theoretical
aspects see [225–227]). Beside typical cooling curves (see Fig. 7.10) with various
assumptions concerning the role of superfluidity, the estimated surface temperatures
of a hand-full of thermally emitting isolated neutron stars are shown. Although the
temperature measurements are not yet accurate, the data support the theoretical prediction that the nucleons in the core are in a superfluid state.

7.12 Neutron Stars in Binaries
Almost half of all stars about us are members of binary systems. Some of these double stars are so close that in certain evolutionary phases they can exchange matter,
and evolve as a result in strange ways. The more massive star of a binary system
evolves faster and thus becomes a red giant while his partner is still on the main
sequence. In a close binary it spills matter onto its companion and with reduced
mass then evolves into a neutron star or a black hole. Later the companion star in
turn swells up as a red giant, returning matter to the collapsed star. In this accretion
process the compact star turns into an X-ray source. The initially less massive star
evolves further and may, if sufficiently massive, finally collapse into either a neutron star or a black hole. In this way binary pulsars like the Hulse–Taylor pulsar
presumably have been formed.
Accretion on neutron stars leads to a broad range of fascinating phenomena. For
the benefit of those readers who have not yet been exposed to this subject we give
here a first introduction. For further information on this vast field of modern astrophysics we recommend beside [26] the copiously illustrated book [30]. More
technical literature will be quoted later.

7.12.1 Some Mechanics in Binary Systems
For a basic understanding of mass exchange in close binaries, we recall some mechanics. In particular, we introduce the so-called “Roche lobe” of a star in a binary
system.

7.12

Suppose, for simplicity, that the two components of the binary system move
about each other in circular orbits. The orbital period Pb and the angular frequency
Ω are given by Kepler’s third law:

(7.129)

where M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars and a is the distance between
their centers of mass. We now consider the motion of a test particle in the gravitational field of the two masses (restricted three-body problem). Its motion is most
conveniently described in the co-rotating system:
v̇ = −∇ψ − 2Ω × v.

(7.130)

Here, v is the velocity and ψ is the sum of the Newtonian and centrifugal potentials:
ψ(x) = −

GM1 GM2 1
−
− (Ω × x)2 .
r1
r2
2

(7.131)

The equilibrium positions in the comoving frame are thus the critical points of ψ .
There are five of these, of which three are collinear with M1 and M2 (Euler 1767)
and two are equilateral (Lagrange 1773). Moreover, the three collinear equilibrium
points are unstable (Plummer 1901). The equilateral equilibrium points are stable
for sufficiently small mass ratios (see Exercise 7.9).
Taking the inner product of (7.129) with v leads to the Jacobi integral:
1 2
v + ψ = const.
2

(7.132)

Obviously, the potential ψ cannot increase above the value of this integral as the
particle moves. For this reason, the structure of the equipotential surfaces of ψ is
important. These are shown in Fig. 7.11, along with the five equilibrium positions.
The equipotential surface passing through the “inner Lagrange point” L1 is particularly important. Inside this critical Roche surface the equipotential surfaces, which
enclose the two centers of mass, are disjoint; outside this is no more the case. The
Roche limit thus determines the maximum volume, the so-called Roche lobe, of the
star. If this is exceeded, a portion of the outer layers of the star will flow over to the
companion.
For a fluid the Navier–Stokes equation becomes in the co-rotating system
Dt v = −∇ψ − 2Ω × v −

1
∇p + friction terms,
ρ

(7.133)

where Dt v denotes the hydrodynamic derivative of the velocity field. For a stationary situation (v = 0 in the co-rotating system) one obtains, as expected,
∇p = −ρ∇ψ.

Hence, the surfaces of constant pressure, and in particular the surface of the star, are
equipotential surfaces of ψ .
We now imagine a situation in which one of the two stars enters a red giant phase
during which it fills up its Roche lobe. If this happens, matter flows through the
inner saddle point into the Roche volume of its partner. Part of it may escape and
the rest will be accreted by the secondary. This mechanism will play an important
role throughout this section.

7.12.2 Some History of X-Ray Astronomy
One of the scientific motivations to start X-ray astronomy was to detect thermal radiation from cooling neutron stars in the X-ray energy band. The hope was to detect
youngish neutron stars with surface temperatures around a few million degrees. The
first X-ray source outside the solar system, Sco X-1, was discovered back in 1962 by
Giacconi et al. during a short, five minute rocket exposure of a detector consisting
of three Geiger counters (∼ 20 cm2 area). The newly discovered X-ray source did
not fit the cooling scheme; the temperature was about a factor ten higher—hence the
luminosity about 104 higher—than expected. The source Sco X-1 later turned out
to be an accreting binary neutron star. This interpretation was suggested already in
1967 by Shkolovskii, shortly before pulsars were discovered.
The “X-ray window” was really opened when the famous X-ray observatory
UHURU was launched from the coast of Kenya on December 12, 1970. Uhuru is
the Swahili word for “freedom” and was chosen because the launch took place on
Kenya’s independence day. Within less than two years, about one hundred galactic
and fifty extragalactic X-ray sources were discovered with this orbiting X-ray observatory in the spectral range 2–20 keV. Some of these sources show very regular
short X-ray pulsations (X-ray pulsars). One of the best known examples is Hercules
X-1 with a period of 1.24 s. This period is, however, not strictly constant, but varies
with a period of 1.70017 days, showing that Her X-1 is a member of a close binary
system. We now know of many such systems, for which the optical partner has also
been unambiguously identified.
The completely irregular, rapidly fluctuating source Cyg X-1, which most probably contains a black hole, was also discovered with UHURU.
UHURU observations also showed that the space between galaxies in clusters of
galaxies contains hot gas with a temperature of (10–100) × 106 K.
In 1975 and 1976 astronomers discovered a new class of X-ray sources, the socalled bursters, using the satellites ANS, SAS-3, OSO 7,8, and others. One observed
brief outbursts of X-rays from sources near the galactic center of our galaxy or in
globular clusters. They repeat themselves at irregular intervals which lie between a
few hours and several days. Typically, the maximum intensity is reached in a few
seconds and then falls back to its original value after about a minute. In this brief
period some 1039 erg of X-ray energy are emitted. (This is comparable to the energy
radiated by the Sun in about two weeks.)
The detectors which were carried by these satellites did not have a high sensitivity and thus only the strongest sources could be observed. An X-ray observatory
having a sensitivity comparable to that of optical and radio telescopes at the time
became available with the launch of the “Einstein Observatory” in November 1978.
In addition, the telescope’s resolution of four seconds of arc was 1000 times higher
than the resolution of the X-ray detectors used previously. Thus, within just fifteen
years, a development took place which is comparable to the progress achieved in
optical astronomy from Galileo’s telescope of 1610 to the five meter Hale reflector
on Mount Palomar.

420

7

White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars

Since then other successful missions (EXOSAT, ROSAT, . . .) have been
launched. More recently, two powerful X-ray observatories (CHANDRA and
XMM-NEWTON) have been put in orbit; future ones are in the planning stage.

7.12.3 X-Ray Pulsars
We now know a large number of compact galactic X-ray sources with an X-ray luminosity LX > 1034 erg/s, with star-like optical counterparts. A considerable fraction
of these are X-ray pulsars and have been identified unambiguously as binary star
systems. For almost all of these, the companion is a bright O or B star having a
mass of about ten to twenty solar masses (high-mass X-ray binaries). Her X-1 is an
exception to this rule, since the mass of its companion is only about 2M .
We believe we have a definite qualitative interpretation of the X-ray pulsars. The
companion of the normal star is a neutron star which sucks up gas that is lost from
its partner. The accreted5 matter falls eventually onto the surface of the neutron
star, releasing about 10 percent of its rest energy. Neutron stars, as a rule, have
very strong magnetic fields, often of order 1012 Gauss, since the magnetic flux is
conserved when highly conductive stellar material collapses to a neutron star; this
gives rise to an amplification factor of the magnetic field strength of order 1010 .
Such strong fields cause the plasma to fall on the neutron star in the regions of the
magnetic poles, giving rise to two “hot spots” of intense radiation (see Fig. 7.12).
The magnetic field axis does not in general coincide with the axis of rotation, and
hence the hot spots rotate with the star. The direction of the emitted X-rays also
rotates, similar to the beam emitted by a lighthouse. If the rotating beam sweeps by
the Earth, the star appears as an X-ray pulsar. In many cases, the X-ray emission is
periodically eclipsed by the optical companion, with the orbital period of the binary
system.
The observed X-ray luminosities are in the range LX ≃ 1036 –1038 erg/s. Thermal radiation of this magnitude from a source with the small surface area A of the
radiating polar cap requires a temperature T , with

where σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. We now show that A ∼ 1 km2 , whence
the X-rays must have energies of a few keV, in agreement with the observations.
To estimate the surface area A, we need the extension of the magnetosphere.
The “magnetospheric radius” rA , also called Alfvén radius, is roughly the distance
from the neutron star where the magnetic pressure B 2 /8π is balanced by the ram
pressure ρvr2 of the accreting gas. Approximating the radial velocity vr by the freefall velocity vf = (2GMN S /r)1/2 , and using the continuity equation for spherical
5 accrescere: increase by accumulation.

accretion, 4πr 2 ρvf = Ṁ, where Ṁ is the mass accretion rate, one obtains for typical values Ṁ ≃ 1017 g/s, MN S ≃ 1.4M , and a magnetic field strength at the pole
of B = 5 × 1012 G an Alfvén radius rA ≃ 100RN S ≃ 1,000 km. (See also Exercise 7.10.)
Since the integral curves of a magnetic dipole field satisfy in polar coordinates
sin2 ϑ/r = const, we expect for the surface area of the radiating polar cap: A ≃
2

N S /rA ) ≃ 1 km .

The mass-flow rates required to produce the observed X-ray luminosities can
be sustained in close high-mass binary systems quite readily. Possible mechanisms
are:
1. Stellar winds: The winds from O or B super-giants have typically mass-loss rates
of 10−7 –10−6 M /yr, and this can easily lead to an accretion rate of 10−9 M /yr
onto the compact companion. Indeed, the orbiting collapsed star is an obstacle
in the supersonic stellar wind, and hence a bow-shaped shock front is formed
around it. Some of the material flowing through this shock is decelerated enough

422

7

White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars

to be captured by the compact star. Since about 10 percent of the rest energy can
be converted to radiation, this is sufficient to account for the observed luminosity.
2. Roche lobe overflow: The normal companion can expand to the Roche limit
if it is a blue or red supergiant. In this case a considerable mass transfer of
10−8 –10−3 M /yr can occur. However, since column densities larger than about
1 g/cm2 are opaque to keV X-rays, it is possible that this Roche overflow extinguishes the X-ray source. This type of mass transfer probably produces an
X-ray source only if the normal companion has a mass not larger than a few
solar masses. It certainly plays a crucial role in burst sources (see Sect. 7.12.5).
Fig. 7.12 shows schematically these two canonical pictures of X-ray sources.
3. X-ray heating: A transfer of mass can also be induced if the X-rays heat up the
outer layers of the optical companion. Such a self-sustaining mechanism may be
operating in Her X-1.
The details of how accretion takes place, the conversion of potential energy to
radiation and the transport of the radiation through the hot plasma that is above the
poles are extremely complicated problems. Much of the relevant physics is treated
in detail in the book [31]. For the study of accretion disks we recommend [32].

7.12.4 The Eddington Limit
There are no steady X-ray sources brighter than about 5 × 1038 erg/s−1 . This can
roughly be understood as follows.
Let L be the luminosity, assumed to be generated uniformly over a sphere of
radius R. When is L large enough such that the radiation pressure stops the accretion
on a compact object? To answer this we note that the radiation pressure acting on
an electron produces a force of magnitude equal to σT × flux/c, i.e.,
force
σT (L/4πR 2 )
=
,
electron
c
where σT is the Thomson cross section. For a hydrogen plasma this balances the
gravitational attraction for the Eddington luminosity LE determined by (mp is the
proton mass)
GMmp

Thus,
LE =

4πGMmp c
= 1.3 × 1038 (M/M ) erg/s.
σT

(7.138)

We conclude that a neutron star of M = 1.4M cannot produce a steady luminosity greater than about 2 × 1038 erg/s. Because of the assumed spherical symmetry,
this argument is, of course, an over-simplification, but it gives the right order of
magnitude.

7.12.5 X-Ray Bursters
The bursters, already mentioned earlier, represent a completely different class of Xray sources. Below we give the main reasons why the following interpretation of the
observations is believed to be correct.
We are again dealing with compact binary systems of which one member is a
neutron star. For burst sources, the normal optical companion is, however, a rather
low mass star with perhaps 0.5–1 M . If this evolves to the red giant stage and fills
its critical Roche volume, matter can flow over through the inner Lagrange point
into the gravitational field of the neutron star. Because of the angular momentum of
the material as it leaves the star it cannot fall directly onto the compact object, but
forms an accretion disk. The critical volume can be attained by low-mass stars since
the orbital periods are in most cases only a few hours. The critical “radius” is given
by the following approximate expression (see [242])

Evidence for accretion disks for low-mass X-ray binaries has been established for
a subclass, the so-called X-ray transients. For these one can observe also absorption
lines in the optical spectrum during quiescent periods, which are characteristic for
a low mass star. This indicates that the dominant portion of the optical spectrum
is emitted from the hot accretion disk, producing the emission lines, and that the
luminosity of the optical member is low. In this connection it is interesting that
the X-ray sources which do not pulsate and which do not show eclipses are almost
always found close to the center of the Galaxy (galactic bulge sources) or in globular
clusters, i.e., in rather old stellar populations. For this reason, one may expect that

424

White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars

Fig. 7.13 Outer layers of an
accreting weakly magnetized
neutron star

the neutron star’s magnetic field has partially decayed6 or that the dipole axis is
aligned with the axis of rotation. This would explain the absence of pulsations. For
a rather low field, matter falling onto the neutron star is distributed more or less
uniformly over the surface of the neutron star and the gravitational energy released
is emitted in the form of an approximately constant X-ray radiation.
The accreted matter consists mainly of hydrogen and helium and thus fusion reactions can take place. In fact, it is now established that the “normal” bursts are
due to thermonuclear explosions. Underneath a layer of hydrogen about 1 m thick,
the density has risen to about 104−6 g/cm3 (verify this by a simple estimate). If the
neutron star is still relatively hot, the hydrogen can ignite at a depth of approximately one meter. As detailed calculations show, an approximately equally thick
layer of helium is produced below this. Still deeper, helium becomes unstable with
respect to fusion into carbon. Thus at least two thin shells are burning, as indicated in
Fig. 7.13. As K. Schwarzschild and R. Härm discovered in a different context, these
shells are unstable against thermonuclear reactions.7 The existence and strength of
this instability are consequences of the very strong temperature dependence of the
thermonuclear reaction rates. For the situation under discussion, it is augmented by
the partial degeneracy of the burning matter, implying that the pressure does less
strongly respond to the rising temperature.
The p − p chains are not sufficiently temperature sensitive to induce a runaway in
the hydrogen-burning layer. For the CNO cycle the temperature sensitivity is high,
but this is saturated at high reaction rates by the long (∼ 100 s) lifetimes of the
β-unstable nuclei 13 N, 14 O, 15 O and 17 F, which participate in the cycle.
On the other hand, the helium burning layer is unstable for a wide range of conditions, as has been shown by detailed calculations (see [233]). After about 1021 g
of matter have accumulated on the surface, a helium flash is produced in which
almost all of the combustible matter is used up. Most of the energy (≤ 1039 erg)
6 In the magnetohydrodynamic approximation, the characteristic diffusion time of the magnetic

field is τ ≃ 4πσ R 2 /c2 . Inserting typical values for the conductivity σ (see [232]), one obtains
cosmologically long times. Nevertheless, the field of very old neutron stars may be relatively small,
but this is a controversial subject.
7 An analytical discussion of this type of instability has been given in [234].

7.12

is transported to the photosphere and radiated away, mostly as X-rays. The calculated properties of such X-ray bursts (rise time, maximum luminosity, decay time,
etc.) are quite similar to those observed (see [233]). For a typical accretion rate of
1017 g/s, the interval between bursts is a few hours. In the fusion process of helium into carbon, the released nuclear energy is only about 1 MeV per nucleon. The
time average of the energy in the burst should, therefore, be roughly one percent
of the energy released in the steady flow of X-rays. This is indeed observed (with
exceptions).
This thermonuclear flash model has been supported by further observations. During the cooling off phase of a burst, the spectrum is nearly that of a black body. The
emitting surface can then be estimated from the luminosity and the approximate distance of the X-ray source. In all cases one obtains radii of about 10 km after fifteen
seconds. (During the initial phase the radius is about 100 km.) In addition, it has
been shown that an outburst in the optical region occurs nearly simultaneously with
the X-ray burst. Its maximum is, however, delayed by a few seconds. The interpretation is obvious: The X-ray burst heats up the accretion disk and a delayed optical
“echo” results. The data also show that the extension of the accretion disk is not far
from 106 km.
Finally, a unique source, the so-called Rapid Burster MXB 1730-335, should be
mentioned. During its active periods, which are separated by about six months, it
displays every 3–4 hours X-ray bursts of the type already described. In addition,
it emits in rapid succession another kind of X-ray bursts, often a few thousands in
one day. This machine-gun fire is probably due to some sort of instability in the
accretion flow.

7.12.6 Formation and Evolution of Binary Systems
In this section we give a sketch of evolutionary scenarios that lead to the formation
of binary X-ray sources. We begin with the formation of massive X-ray binaries,
and describe the result of a particular computation (see Fig. 7.14).
The simulation [235] starts at time 0 with a massive pair (14.4+8.0 M ) of zeroage main sequence stars (ZAMS) in a 100 day binary, assumed to have been formed
together. The more massive star evolves rapidly through hydrogen burning, generates a helium core and then within 13.3 million years expands to fill its Roche lobe.
The outer layers of the bloated red giant spill over onto the companion star. In less
than 100,000 years 8.5 M are transferred onto the originally less massive star. Only
a 3.5 M helium star remains of the originally more massive component. The originally less massive star has now become a very massive main sequence star with a
mass of 16.5 M . As a result of angular momentum conservation, the orbital period
has increased to 416 days. Furthermore, an equatorial ring or disk around the newly
massive star is formed because it is rotating rapidly. The further evolution of the
helium star proceeds at an accelerating rate. (In more narrow binaries it will once
more fill its Roche lobe, thus initiating a second mass transfer.) After 1.7 million

426

finally of a double neutron star system (binary pulsar). (From [235])

years, the core becomes unstable and collapses. A portion of the outer shell may
be driven off in a supernova explosion. The system will probably not be disrupted
because the secondary has now a much larger mass, but the separation is now much
bigger and generally highly eccentric. The remnant is a neutron star (radio pulsar)
or a black hole orbiting about what is called a Be star.
At this point the secondary is still unevolved. At a later stage it will also leave
the main sequence and after about 10 million years it becomes a supergiant with
a strong stellar wind. Accretion of some of this matter by the compact companion
turns the latter into a strong X-ray source (high mass X-ray binary, HMXB). This
stage lasts, however, less than 100,000 years, after which the supergiant has filled its
Roche lobe and extinguishes the X-ray source by excessive accretion. The compact

7.12

427

companion can accept only a small fraction of the out-flowing gas. The rest will be
lost from the system. At the end of this common envelope and mass loss stage, there
remains a close binary system of Pb = 2.6 hours, consisting of a neutron star and a
4.1M helium star. The latter evolves rapidly. Roche lobe overflow (RLO) transfers
angular momentum to the neutron star, and turns it into a rapidly rotating (recycled)
pulsar. Finally, there will be a second supernova explosion and a system like the
Hulse–Taylor pulsar may come into being.
The origin of low-mass X-ray binaries is less clear. One problem is that a supernova explosion in a system with a low-mass partner would in most cases be disrupted. Perhaps the more massive of the two stars first becomes a white dwarf, and
only in a later accretion process it may reach the critical mass limit, collapsing to a
neutron star without disrupting the binary system. However, other scenarios are possible. Some low mass X-ray binaries are presumably the progenitors of millisecond
pulsars to which we now turn.

7.12.7 Millisecond Pulsars
The first millisecond pulsar (1937+21) was discovered in 1982 with a rotational period of 1.558 ms. This pulsar was very mysterious, because it has no companion
which could have spun the neutron star. Its estimated magnetic field (from the decrease of the pulsar period due to magnetic dipole radiation) is 10,000 times smaller
than that of typical pulsars before this discovery.
Later, the discovery of the eclipsing millisecond pulsar 1957+20 suggested a
plausible mechanism for the formation of a single millisecond pulsar like 1937+21.
The pulsar has a companion of only ∼ 10−2 M which is most probably evaporating
through the action of a strong pulsar energy flux.
As mentioned before, a neutron star in a binary can be spun-up during an accretion phase since the in-falling matter has angular momentum. The population
of millisecond pulsars are such recycled pulsars. At the time of writing one knows
more than 40 binary millisecond pulsars, and this number will rapidly increase. An
accreting neutron star will adjust its rotational period to an equilibrium value Peq ,
which is equal to the Keplerian period of the inner edge of the accretion disk. The
Alfvén radius (7.139) gives an estimate to this inner edge. (A more careful analysis
confirms this within a factor of approximately 2.) The synchronous radius rsynch is
defined by
ΩKepler (rsynch ) =

Black Holes

In my entire scientific life (. . .) the most shattering experience has been the realization
that an exact solution of Einstein’s equations of general relativity, discovered by the New
Zealand mathematician Roy Kerr, provides the absolutely exact representation of untold
numbers of massive black holes that populate the Universe.
—S. Chandrasekhar (1975)

8.1 Introduction
All stars rotate more or less rapidly. When a horizon is formed during gravitational
collapse, a Schwarzschild black hole is thus never produced. One expects, however,
that the horizon will quickly settle down to a stationary state as a result of the emission of gravitational waves. The geometry of the stationary black hole is of course
no longer spherically symmetric.
It is remarkable that we know all stationary black hole solutions of Einstein’s
vacuum equations. Surprisingly, they are fully characterized by just two parameters, namely the mass and angular momentum of the hole. These quantities can be
determined, in principle, by distant observers.
Thus when matter disappears behind a horizon, an exterior observer sees almost
nothing of its individual properties. One can no longer say for example how many
baryons formed the black hole. A huge amount of information is thus lost. The mass
and angular momentum completely determine the external field, which is known
analytically (Kerr solution). This led J.A. Wheeler to say “A black hole has no hair”,
and the previous statement is now known as the no-hair-theorem.
The proof of this fact is an outstanding contribution of mathematical physics, and
was completed only in the course of a number of years by various authors (W. Israel,
B. Carter, S. Hawking and D. Robinson). A first decisive step was made by W. Israel
(see [244, 245]) who was able to show that a static black hole solution of Einstein’s
vacuum equation has to be spherically symmetric and, therefore, agree with the
Schwarzschild solution. We shall give Israel’s proof in Sect. 8.2. In a second paper
Israel extended this result to black hole solutions of the coupled Einstein–Maxwell

system. The Reissner–Nordstrøm 2-parameter family (see Sect. 4.9) turned out to
exhaust all static electrovac black holes. It was then conjectured by Israel, Penrose
and Wheeler that in the stationary case the electrovac black holes should all be given
by the 3-parameter Kerr–Newman family, discussed later in this chapter. After a
number of steps by various authors this conjecture could finally be proven. For a
very readable text book presentation of the proof we refer to [246].
With this black hole uniqueness theorem it was natural to conjecture further
generalizations for more complicated matter models, for instance for the Einstein–
Yang–Mills system. Surprisingly, it turned out that generalized no-hair conjectures
do not always hold (for reviews, see [247] and [248]). While this development led
to a whole sequence of surprises and remarkable insights, it is hardly of any astrophysical significance. For this reason we leave it at that.

8.2 Proof of Israel’s Theorem
We give here Israel’s original demonstration of the statement that a static black hole
solution of Einstein’s vacuum equation has to be spherically symmetric, although
there are more recent proofs that need less ‘technical assumptions’. The main reason is that Israel’s argument is both ingenious and entirely elementary, while more
modern proofs make use of the positive energy theorem (to be proven in the next
chapter).
Since the spacetime (M, (4) g) is assumed to be static outside the horizon, it has
(locally) the form (see Sect. 2.9)
M = R × Σ,

(4)

g = −S 2 dt 2 + g,

(8.1)

where g is a Riemannian metric on Σ and S a smooth (lapse) function on Σ . We
assume that (8.1) holds globally in the exterior spacetime region of the black hole.
The Killing field k with respect to which (M, (4) g) is static is k = ∂t . Note also that
S 2 = −k, k.
We recall some of the formulas derived in the solution of Exercise 3.4 in Sect. 3.1.
Relative to an adapted orthonormal tetrad {θ μ }, with θ 0 = S dt and {θ i } an orthonormal triad of (Σ, g), we have (in the present notation)

(see DG, (A.21)).

8.2.1 Foliation of Σ, Ricci Tensor, etc.
As one of the ‘technical assumptions’ we require that the lapse function S has no
critical points: dS = 0 on Σ . Then
ρ := dS, dS−1/2 > 0,

(8.3)

and Σ is foliated by the leaves {S = const}.
We introduce in Σ adapted coordinates. Consider for every point p ∈ Σ the
1-dimensional subspace of Tp Σ perpendicular to the tangent space of the leave
S = const through p. This 1-dimensional distribution is, of course, involutive in the
sense of DG, Definition C.3. As a special case of the Frobenius theorem (see DG,
Proposition C.4) we can introduce coordinates {x i } in Σ , such that x A (A = 2, 3)
are constant along the integral curves of the distribution. Moreover, for x 1 we can
choose S and obtain the parametrization
g = ρ 2 dS 2 + g̃,

g̃ = g̃AB dx A dx B

(A, B = 2, 3),

(8.4)

where ρ and g̃AB depend in general on all three coordinates x 1 = S and x A .
Next, we express the quantities appearing on the right of (8.2a)–(8.2g) by objects
which belong to the foliation of Σ introduced above. One of these is the second
fundamental form KAB of the leaves, given by the Weingarten equation (see DG,
(A.11)):
KAB = N, ∇∂A ∂B .

(8.5)

Here, N is the normalized normal vector N = ρ1 ∂1 . (In this subsection we work
relative to the coordinate basis {∂i }.) From (8.5) we get
KAB =

(8.9b)

where K = K AA and ∇˜ denotes the covariant derivative belonging to g̃.—We could
now proceed by adapting the results of the 3+1 formalism in Sect. 3.9 to the present
situation. Instead, we proceed with explicit calculations.
A short computation gives for the Christoffel symbols

We emphasize that this holds only if the vacuum equations are imposed. We shall
have to require that this invariant remains finite at the horizon. Possible singularities
should be behind the horizon.

8.2.3 The Proof (W. Israel, 1967)
The hypersurfaces {S 2 = const} of M are invariant under the isometric flow belonging to the Killing field k (show that the Lie derivative of S 2 with respect to k
vanishes). Hence, k is tangent to these hypersurfaces. For positive constants these
are thus timelike (a timelike vector cannot be orthogonal to a timelike or lightlike
vector). Obviously, such hypersurfaces can be crossed in both directions. Therefore,
the assumed horizon must coincide with the hypersurface {S = 0} and this must be a
null hypersurface (see DG, Definition A.2). Only then it is tangent to the light cone
at each of its points, thus allowing crossing in one direction only. The null vector
field k is orthogonal to this null hypersurface (see Exercise 8.5).
We also note the following about this null hypersurface. From DG, Proposition A.1 it follows that the integral curves of k, when suitable parameterized, are
null geodesics. These are called null geodesic generators of the horizon.
With Israel we assume that {S 2 = −k, k = const} are submanifolds of Σ which
are topological 2-spheres. Asymptotically S −→ 1, because Σ is assumed to be
asymptotically flat in the sense of the definition given in Sect. 3.7 (see p. 119).
In what follows the Riemannian volume form of {S = const}, belonging to g̃, is
denoted by η̃.
First we want to indicate the main idea of Israel’s proof. Using the previously
developed results, we shall derive as a consequence of the vacuum field equations
two differential inequalities with the following structure
d(f η̃) ≤ dS ∧ g η̃,

(8.24)

436

8 Black Holes

where f and g are functions on Σ. (Note that, as 3-forms, both sides are proportional to the volume form η on Σ , and the inequality sign means that the proportionality factors obey the inequality.) Furthermore, the equality sign in (8.24) holds
˜ both
if and only if, the trace-free part of the second fundamental form KAB and ∇ρ
vanish. We shall then integrate the two inequalities over Σ , and replace with Stokes’
theorem the left-hand sides by boundary integrals over the horizon and a 2-sphere
2 ‘at infinity’. We will be able to work out the integrals on both sides, and conS∞

With this information it will be quite easy to deduce the spherical symmetry.
As the main point we now derive the announced differential inequalities. For this,
let us first collect some of the previous results. By (8.1) and (8.4) the metric of the
static spacetime is parameterized as
(4)

g = −S 2 dt 2 + ρ 2 dS 2 + g̃AB dx A dx B .

(8.26)

The orthonormal tetrads for which (8.2a)–(8.2g) are valid are further specified, by
adapting them to (8.26): θ 0 = S dt (as above), θ 1 = ρ dS and {θ A } an orthonormal
2-bein for g̃. In order to avoid confusions we put hats on indices which are connected
to the orthonormal tetrad {θ μ }, while for the indices connected to the coordinate
basis we use standard notation. From (8.2g) and (8.16) we get, without using the
field equations,

With this we are done. For completeness we want to show how the derived formulas imply the Schwarzschild solution. Denoting derivatives with respect to S by

8.3 Derivation of the Kerr Solution
The Kerr solution, which describes stationary rotating black holes, ranks among
the most important solutions of Einstein’s (vacuum) equations. Originally, it was
found in 1963 more or less by accident (see [249]) and its physical meaning was
not recognized until later. E.T. Newman and coworkers showed in 1965 that the
Kerr solution can be guessed formally from the Schwarzschild solution by means of
a complex coordinate transformation (see [250]). (In [251] this was generalized to
electrically charged black holes.) The Kerr (–Newman) solution was also obtained in
a systematic study of algebraically degenerated solutions of the Einstein (–Maxwell)

8.3 Derivation of the Kerr Solution

443

equations (see [252]). Unfortunately, there is still no physically natural route leading
to the Kerr (–Newman) solution.2
In this section we shall find the Kerr solution in what we regard as the most
natural way. In the first six subsections we shall see that the problem of finding
stationary and axisymmetric solutions of Einstein’s vacuum equations can be completely reduced to a non-linear partial differential equation for a complex potential,
defined in a certain region of the plane. This so-called Ernst equation for the complex potential ε(x, y) reads as follows:

This is the Euler–Lagrange equation for the Lagrange density
L=

(x 2 − 1)ε,x ε̄,x + (1 − y 2 )ε,y ε̄,y
.
(1 − ε ε̄)2

(8.67)

So far the things are quite straightforward. What is, however, really miraculous
is that the simplest non-trivial solution of the Ernst equation, namely
ε(x, y) = px + qy,

(8.68)

where p, q ∈ R with p 2 + q 2 = 1, corresponds to the Kerr black hole. Exactly this 2parameter family of stationary axisymmetric vacuum solutions has event horizons,
as is established by a uniqueness theorem. A priori there is, however, no reason
why this should be so. We learn this only with hindsight through a rather involved
argument. A basic reason for why there is, presumably, no more direct way to arrive
at this result is connected with the fact that an event horizon is a global concept. It
is, therefore, impossible to impose the existence of a horizon in any local manner.
The details of what follows are somewhat lengthly. We recommend to first take a
glance at the line of reasoning, before going into the details. Section 8.3.1 is of more
general significance. There we shall arrive at a very convenient parametrization of
stationary axisymmetric metrics which is, for instance, also the starting point for the
study of rotating neutron star models (see Sect. 7.10).

8.3.1 Axisymmetric Stationary Spacetimes
A spacetime (M, g) is axisymmetric if it admits the group SO(2) as an isometry
group such that the group orbits are closed spacelike curves. In what follows we
2 Since the last edition of this book, the situation has improved. Under the assumption that a stationary, axisymmetric vacuum solution has a Killing horizon (defined in Sect. 8.4.4), it was constructively shown that it is the Kerr solution [253]. The explicit construction, based on the “inverse
scattering method” for solutions of certain boundary value problems, provides thus at the same
time a nice uniqueness proof for stationary axisymmetric black holes. This result was recently
extended to the Kerr–Newman family [254] (including the case of a degenerate horizon).

444

consider only asymptotically flat spacetimes. The spacetime (M, g) is stationary
and axisymmetric, if R × SO(2) acts isometrically, such that (M, g) is axisymmetric with respect to the subgroup SO(2), and the Killing field belonging to R (time
translations) is at least asymptotically timelike. We allow, however, “ergospheres”,
where this Killing field becomes spacelike.
The two Killing fields belonging to R and SO(2) will be denoted by k, respectively m. These are, of course, commuting
[k, m] = 0.

(8.69)

The orbits of the R × SO(2) action are 2-dimensional submanifolds, whose tangent
spaces are spanned by k and m. The collection of these tangent space define in the
terminology of DG, Appendix C an involutive (integrable) 2-distribution E. Beside
E we consider the orthogonal distribution E ⊥ and make the generic assumption that
E ∩ E ⊥ = {0}. Then E and E ⊥ are complementary: Tp M = Ep ⊕ Ep⊥ , p ∈ M. The
distribution E ⊥ is annihilated by the 1-forms k  and m . The Frobenius theorem
(proven in DG, Appendix C) tells us that E ⊥ is also involutive if and only if the
ideal generated by k  and m is differential. This in turn is, by the same theorem,
equivalent to the Frobenius conditions
k ∧ m ∧ dk = 0,

k ∧ m ∧ dm = 0.

(8.70)

(From now on we drop the symbol .) We shall soon see that Einstein’ vacuum
equations imply the Frobenius conditions (8.70), so E ⊥ is integrable. This is also
true for certain matter models, as we shall see.
If the conditions (8.70) are satisfied we say that (M, g) is circular. Then there
exist, as shown in DG, Appendix C, adapted coordinates x a (a = 0, 1), x A (A =
2, 3), such that


k = ∂t ,
m = ∂ϕ x 0 = t, x 1 = ϕ ,
(8.71)
and

 
 
g = gab x C dx a dx b + gAB x C dx A dx B .

(8.72)

(The gμν depend only on x A (A = 2, 3).)

8.3.2 Ricci Circularity
We now show that the Frobenius conditions are equivalent to the Ricci circularity
properties for the Ricci forms introduced in (8.58):
k ∧ m ∧ R(k) = 0,

k ∧ m ∧ R(m) = 0.

(8.73)

To show this, we first rewrite (8.70) in terms of the twist forms belonging to k and m:
ωk =

1
∗ (k ∧ dk),
2

ωm =

1
∗ (m ∧ dm).
2

(8.74)

8.3 Derivation of the Kerr Solution

445

For example, the first 4-form in (8.70) is proportional to m ∧ ∗ωk = m, ωk η with η
the volume form of (M, g). Thus the Frobenius conditions (8.70) are equivalent to
m, ωk  = 0,

k, ωm  = 0.

(8.75)

Using the Cartan identity Lm = d ◦ im + im ◦ d, we find for the differential of m, ωk 
dm, ωk  = dim ωk = −im dωk ,
where we used that m is a Killing field. In a footnote at the end of this subsection,
we shall derive the important identity


(8.76)
dωk = ∗ k ∧ R(k) .
Inserting this gives



dm, ωk  = −im ∗ k ∧ R(k) ,

(8.77)

and, interchanging the roles of k and m,


dk, ωm  = −ik ∗ m ∧ R(m) ,

(8.78)

This shows that the Frobenius conditions imply the Ricci circularity properties
(8.73), because for any p-form α and vector field X we have the useful algebraic
identity (see DG, (14.34))


(8.79)
iX ∗ α = ∗ α ∧ X  .
Conversely, the Ricci circularity properties (8.73) imply by (8.77) and (8.78) that
dk, ωm  = dm, ωk  = 0. The scalar products in (8.75) are thus constant. Since
spacetime is assumed to be asymptotically flat, there are fixpoints under the SO(2)
action in which m vanishes. Thus the Frobenius conditions hold. These are therefore, in particular, implied by the vacuum field equations. But there are other interesting cases where this is true.
Consider, for example, the interior of a rigidly rotating neutron star whose
energy-momentum tensor is described by an ideal fluid:
T μν = (ρ + p)uμ uν + pg μν .

(8.80)

The four-velocity field has the form (see (7.121))
u = e−V (k + Ωm),

Ω = const,

(8.81)

where the proportionality factor e−V is determined by the normalization condition
u, u = −1. It is obvious that the field equations in the form



imply the Ricci circularity (8.73).

446

8 Black Holes

In summary, a stationary and axisymmetric, asymptotically flat vacuum spacetime (M, (4) g) can be described locally as follows:
M = Σ × Γ,

(4)

g = σ + g.

(8.82)

Here Σ is diffeomorphic to R × SO(2) and the metric coefficients in the adapted
coordinates x 0 = t, x 1 = ϕ depend only on the coordinates of Γ . (Σ, σ ) is a twodimensional Lorentz manifold, while (Γ, g) is a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold orthogonal to Σ . The two Killing fields k = ∂t , m = ∂ϕ are tangential to Σ
and orthogonal to Γ . Denoting (t, ϕ) by x a , for a = 0, 1 (with indices always taken
from the beginning of the Latin alphabet), and using the indices i, j, k, l, . . . for the
coordinates x i (x i = 2, 3) chosen on Γ , the metrics σ and g have the form (see
(8.72))
 
 
σ = σab x i dx a dx b ,
g = gij x k dx i dx k .
(8.83)
Note that the σab are scalar products of the two Killing fields, and thus have an
invariant meaning.

8.3.3 Footnote: Derivation of Two Identities
In this chapter d † will denote the negative of the codifferential δ, because d † is the
adjoint of Cartan’s differential d in the sense of DG, (15.102).
The following identity for a Killing field K and a p-form α is often useful
d † (K ∧ α) = −K ∧ d † α − LK α.

(8.84)

(As above we use the same letters for K and its associated 1-form K  .) This can be
verified as follows. We have, using (8.79),
d † (K ∧ α) = (−1)p+1 ∗−1 d ∗ (K ∧ α) = − ∗−1 d ∗ (α ∧ K)
= − ∗−1 diK ∗ α = − ∗−1 (LK ∗ α − iK d ∗ α)
= −LK α + ∗−1 iK d ∗ α.
In the last term we use


iK d ∗ α = iK ∗ ∗−1 d ∗ α = iK ∗ (−1)p d † α




= (−1)p ∗ d † α ∧ K = − ∗ K ∧ d † α .

(8.85)

If this is inserted the identity (8.84) follows.
Next, we prove the identity (8.76) for the twist form ω = 12 ∗ (K ∧ dK). In
dω =

d ∗ (K ∧ dK) = − ∗ d † (K ∧ dK)

we apply (8.84) for α = dK. Since LK dK = dLK K = 0, we get, using also (8.58),
dω =

For the metric components σab we also use the notation
V = −k, k,
Furthermore, let
ρ=

X = m, m.

√
−σ = V X + W 2 .

(8.87)

(8.88)

Since among ωk , ωm the latter will play a more distinct role we abbreviate it by ω:
ω ≡ ωm . The following complex Ernst form on the two-dimensional Riemannian
manifold (Γ, g)
E = −dX + 2iω

(8.89)

will be particularly relevant. Below we shall show in a footnote, without using the
field equations, that its codifferential d †(g) E for the metric g is given by

For vacuum solutions, i.e., (4) Ric = 0, the last term is absent.
The exterior differential d of E is obtained with the help of (8.86):


dE = 2i dω = 2i ∗ m ∧ R(m) .

(8.90)

(8.91)

For vacuum solutions the Ernst form E is therefore closed. If the domain of E is
simply connected, E is by the Poincaré’s Lemma exact,
E = dE.

(8.92)

We choose the free additive constant for the Ernst potential E such that (see (8.89))
Re E = −X.

The Ernst potential satisfies the Ernst equation

It will turn out that this equation decouples from the other equations.
At this point we establish an interesting representation of the twist form ω belonging to m, the imaginary part of E . Let

(8.97)
for a 1-form α on Γ , with which the claim (8.96) follows.
Equation (8.97) is best verified by multiplying both sides from the left with
η(σ ) ∧ β, where β is an arbitrary 1-form on Γ . Then the right-hand side becomes

= −2 ∗ (K ∧ ω).

(8.100)

The last equality sign follows from (8.79). This equation is equivalent to (8.99).
Beside the differential of ω, given in (8.86), we are also interested in the codifferential d † ω. For this we apply the identity (8.84) to α = ω/N 2 :

got in the derivation of (8.99):
(8.79)

−ΔN = d † dN = −d † iK dK = d † ∗ (K ∧ ∗dK)


= ∗d(K ∧ ∗dK) = dK, dK + K, ΔK ∗ η.
(Since K is a Killing field, we have d † K = 0 thus ΔK = −d † dK.) With ∗η = −1
and (8.58) we arrive at
−ΔN = 2R(K, K) − dK, dK.

since K, ω = 0. As a result we find

Now, the Ernst form E is a 1-form on Γ . But for any 1-form α on Γ the following

If this is used in (8.107) we finally obtain the important equation (8.90).

8.3.6 Ricci Curvature
For setting up the field equations, we need the Ricci tensor for the following metric
of a stationary and axisymmetric, asymptotically flat spacetime:

8.3 Derivation of the Kerr Solution

where θ a = dx a and θ i = dx i . Recall that all metric coefficients σab and gij depend
only on the x i (i = 2, 3). The structure of (8.109) can be regarded as a generalization
of a warped product.
We need the connection forms ωνμ relative to the basis {θ μ } = {θ a , θ i }. These
satisfy, beside ωμν + ωνμ = dgμν , the first structure equations. Thus
ωai + ωia = 0,
ωab + ωba = dσab = σab,i θ i ,

(8.110)

ωij + ωj i = dgij ,
and
dθ i + ωi j ∧ θ j + ωi a ∧ θ a = 0,
dθ a + ωab ∧ θ b + ωai ∧ θ i = 0.

(8.111)

It is natural to guess that
ωi j = connection forms of (Γ, g),
ωab =

(8.112c)

One readily sees that this ansatz indeed satisfies all equations in (8.110) and (8.111).
Because of (8.112a) we denote the connection forms of (Γ, g) also by ωi j .
It is now easy to compute the curvature forms. We concentrate on those terms
which contribute to the Ricci tensor
(4)

Rμν = Ω αμ (eα , eν ),

(8.113)

where eα = ∂α . Let us begin with (4) Rij = (4) R aiaj + (4) R kikj . From

(8.137)

In this summary no use of the field equations has been made. All these geometrical
relations can, for instance, also be used for rigidly rotating neutron star models.—
From now on we assume the vacuum equations to hold.

8.3.8 Weyl Coordinates
√
According to (8.135b), ρ = −σ is harmonic for a vacuum solution (this is also
true for certain matter models, e.g., electrodynamics). It is natural to use ρ as a
coordinate. For this we have to check, however, that ρ has no critical points. We
make the assumption that the outer domain of communication of the black hole is
simply connected. This is then also the case for the two-dimensional Riemannian
manifold (Γ, γ ) on which ρ is harmonic.
For the proof that ρ has no critical points, we consider the domain {0 < ρ < ρ0 }
of Γ , which is topologically a strip bounded by the curves {ρ = 0} and {ρ = ρ0 }.

456

8 Black Holes

According to the Riemannian mapping theorem there is a holomorphic diffeomorphism from this domain into the strip {0 < Re ζ < ρ0 } of the complex ζ -plane,
whereby the boundary curves are continuously mapped into each other.4
As a function of ζ , ρ is again harmonic and hence also
h := ρ − Re ζ.

(8.138)

Moreover, this function vanishes on the boundary of the strip in the ζ -plane. For
Im ζ −→ ±∞ the function h vanishes also, because of the asymptotic flatness.
Indeed, ρ becomes asymptotically the radial cylindrical coordinate of Minkowski
spacetime, and thus the mapping into the complex ζ -plane becomes asymptotically
the identity, i.e., ρ − Re ζ approaches zero. With this information, the maximum
principle of harmonic functions implies that h ≡ 0. Thus ρ = Re ζ , whence ρ has
no critical points.
The possibility to use ρ as a coordinate simplifies things very much. We can
choose a second coordinate z such that the metric γ becomes conformally flat5


γ = e2h dρ 2 + dz2 .

(8.139)

At this point the four-metric (4) g contains only the three functions X, A and h,

situation.—For convenience, let us collect them here. The Ernst form is exact, i.e.,

4 The Riemannian mapping theorem guarantees always the existence of a holomorphic diffeomor-

phism (conformal transformation) between two simply connected domains D1 and D2 = C. In
general the mapping f : D1 −→ D2 does not extend to a homeomorphism of D̄1 onto D̄2 . If the
boundary of D1 is a finite union of smooth curves, one can show that f extends to a homeomorphism f : D̄1 −→ D̄2 (see, e.g., [59], Proposition 6.2).
5 In a first step we can choose z such that it is orthogonal to ρ: γ = e2h (dρ 2 + f dz2 ). Since ρ is

harmonic, one readily concludes that f is independent of ρ. By a simple redefinition of z we can,
therefore, choose f ≡ 1.

We also write (8.142) and (8.143) explicitly. For this we need various quantities.
Using Exercise 8.3 (with ḡ the flat metric), we get
0 = (0) Rij = (γ ) Rij + γij (γ ) Δh = (γ ) Rij + γij e−2h(0) Δh,
where the index (0) always refers to the flat metric dρ 2 +dz2 . Together with (8.133),
we obtain for the Gaussian curvature
(γ )

K = −e−2h(0) Δh.

(8.145)

For the covariant derivatives of ρ in (8.143) we need the Christoffel symbols for the
metric γ . These are readily found to be
Γ ρρρ = Γ zρz = −Γ ρzz = h,ρ ,

(8.146)

Γ zzz = Γ ρρz = −Γ zρρ = h,z .
ρ

Since for the coordinate ρ, we have (γ ) ∇i (γ ) ∇j ρ = −Γ ij , for i, j = ρ, z, we get

∇z (γ ) ∇z ρ = −(γ ) ∇ρ (γ ) ∇ρ ρ = h,ρ ,

∇ρ (γ ) ∇z ρ = (γ ) ∇z (γ ) ∇ρ ρ = −h,z .

The last expression vanishes thanks to (8.150).
Once we have a solution of the Ernst equation, we can determine A from (8.144),
and h from (8.148a) and (8.148b).

8.3.9 Conjugate Solutions
Below we shall find an extremely simple solution of the Ernst equation which is,
however, at first sight useless. It will turn out that the real part −X = m, m of
the Ernst potential E (see (8.141)) does not vanish on the rotation axis (critical
points of m). Moreover, X ≥ 0 and has the wrong asymptotic behaviour. By a simple
reinterpretation, we will nevertheless be able to arrive at the Kerr solution. For this
the following observation is crucial.
Suppose we have a Ricci flat metric in the Papapetrou form (8.140). Perform the
substitution t −→ ϕ, ϕ −→ −t, then the metric assumes the form
(4)

This can again be brought into the form (8.140) by a suitable substitution X −→ X̂,
A −→ Â and h −→ ĥ. By identification one finds that the coefficients of dϕ 2 are

8.3.10 Basic Equations in Elliptic Coordinates
We shall later see that outside the horizon of the black hole the 2-form k ∧ m is
timelike, ρ 2 = −k ∧ m, k ∧ m > 0, except on the rotation axis where m and thus
ρ vanish. On the horizon ρ vanishes too. In this situation it is helpful to introduce
“elliptical coordinates” x and y. These are defined by



z = μxy,
(8.152)
ρ 2 = μ2 x 2 − 1 1 − y 2 ≥ 0,
with x ≥ 1 and |y| ≤ 1, where μ is a positive constant. The horizon corresponds to
the set {x = 1, −1 ≤ y ≤ 1}, and the northern part of the rotational axis to the part
of the boundary {x ≥ 1, y = 1}. Correspondingly the southern part of the rotational
axis is parameterized by {x ≥ 1, y = −1} (see Fig. 8.1). A short calculation shows
that

We shall write this explicitly a bit later. The transformation of (8.144) to elliptic
coordinates can be derived from the invariant form (8.141). There we can replace
the Hodge dual ∗(γ ) by the Hodge dual of the metric (8.153), and readily find

(8.156)

It will turn out that the Kerr solution corresponds to a solution of the Ernst equation, for which
ε :=

(8.157)

is a linear function of x and y. For this reason we write (8.154) and (8.156) in terms

(8.160)

With this we can write down (8.154) in terms of the elliptic coordinates x and y.
It is, however, easier (and also useful) to use a variational principle for the Ernst
equation (8.149). This is obviously the Euler–Lagrange equation for the Lagrangian

It is, of course, crucial that the Gaussian curvature is multiplied by ρ. Otherwise the
action S would be a topological invariant, according to the Gauss–Bonnet theorem.
The Lagrangian (8.161) can be rewritten as follows, using (8.158)

The two other potentials A and h are determined by (8.155) and (8.159a), (8.159b)
in terms of the Ernst potential, which satisfies the non-linear partial differential
equation (8.165) representing the Euler–Lagrange equation of (8.164).—This is a
remarkable reduction for finding stationary axisymmetric solutions of the vacuum
equations.

8.3.11 The Kerr Solution
The Ernst equation (8.165) has a simple linear solution
ε = px + iqy,

p 2 + q 2 = 1,

p, q ∈ R.

(8.169)

We determine the corresponding potentials X, A and h. As already mentioned in the
introduction, it will turn out that this provides the Kerr solution, a truly miraculous
fact.
Equation (8.168) gives

Unfortunately, this is unacceptable. According to (8.170) the norm of the Killing
field m does not vanish on the rotation axis {y = ±1, x > 1}. Furthermore, X is
not definite in the strip {x > 1, |y| ≤ 1}, corresponding to the region outside the
horizon. Fortunately, we obtain a solution with all desired properties by passing to
the conjugate solution (8.151). For this we obtain after a few manipulations

We transform this result to new coordinates (t, r, ϑ, ϕ), the so-called Boyer–
Lindquist coordinates, which are better adapted. They are defined by
r = m(1 + px),

cos ϑ = y.

(8.179)

Instead of the parameters μ, p and q we introduce
m = μ/p,

a = μq/p.

Note that p 2 + q 2 = 1 implies m2 − a 2 = μ2 ≥ 0, i.e., |a| ≤ m. The following

(8.184) takes the general form (5.213), which was derived more systematically in

8.4 Discussion of the Kerr–Newman Family
The analytic expression for the Kerr metric looks rather complicated. In this section
we analyse this important vacuum solution and will arrive at a good qualitative
understanding. In particular, we shall see that there is an event horizon. Compared
to the Schwarzschild black hole, interesting new phenomena will show up. In this
section we do not assume that the reader has studied the rather lengthy derivation of
the Kerr solution in Sect. 8.3.
We change the notation used in Sect. 8.3.11 slightly and extend the Kerr solution to the three-parameter Kerr–Newman solution that describes also electrically
charged black holes. This will be given in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates (t, r, ϑ, ϕ).
We introduce the following abbreviations involving the three parameters M, a and
Q (c = G = 1)

this reduces to the electromagnetic field (4.167b) of the Reissner–Nordstrøm solution with e = Q.

8.4.1 Gyromagnetic Factor of a Charged Black Hole
The three parameters M, a and Q are most easily interpreted by looking at the
asymptotic forms of the metric g and the electromagnetic field F . The leading terms
in the expansion of the metric in powers of 1/r are the same as for Q = 0, and have

Asymptotically the electric field is a Coulomb field with charge Q.
In general the electric charge is given by the following Gaussian flux integral

This formula comes about as follows. Consider a spacelike hypersurface Σ which

When Σ extends to spatial infinity and D becomes all of Σ , we obtain (8.201). It
is natural to adopt this equation as a definition of the total electric charge for more
general situations, in particular for black holes with singularities inside the horizon.
If the asymptotic form for F in (8.198) is inserted in (8.201), one easily finds that the
flux integral on the right agrees with the parameter Q in the Kerr–Newman solution.
So Q is the electric charge of the black hole.

8.4.2 Symmetries of the Metric
The metric coefficients (8.193) are all independent of t and ϕ. Hence
k=

∂t

and m =

∂
∂ϕ

(8.205)

are Killing fields, i.e., Lk g = Lm g = 0. (In Sect. 8.3.1 this was actually the starting
point for the derivation of the Kerr metric.) Therefore, the metric coefficients gtt ,
gtϕ and gϕϕ are scalar products of these two commuting Killing fields and have thus
an intrinsic meaning. We note
gtt = k, k,

gtϕ = k, m,

gϕϕ = m, m.

8.4.3 Static Limit and Stationary Observers
An observer moving along a world line with constant r, ϑ and uniform angular
velocity sees an unchanging spacetime geometry, and is thus a stationary observer.
His angular velocity, measured at infinity, is
ω=

where u is the four-velocity of the observer. This four-velocity is proportional to a

The left-hand side vanishes, i.e., k + ωm becomes lightlike, for

Note that

(8.211)

For an interpretation of Ω consider stationary observers who are non-rotating
with respect to local freely falling test particles that have been dropped in radially from infinity. Since the angular momentum of such test particles vanishes, we
have for these special stationary observers, so-called Bardeen observers, u, m = 0,
hence k + ωm, m = 0, i.e., ω = Ω. Obviously ωmin = 0 if and only if gtt = 0, that
is for k, k = 0:

r = r0 (ϑ) := M + M 2 − Q2 − a 2 cos2 ϑ.
(8.212)
Ω = −β ϕ = a

We always assume that M 2 > a 2 + Q2 ; otherwise there exists a “naked singularity”
(see below).
An observer is said to be static (relative to the “fixed stars”) if ω = 0, so that u
is proportional to k (see (8.208)). Static observers can exist only outside the static
limit {r = r0 (ϑ)}. At the static limit, k becomes lightlike. An observer would have
to move at the speed of light in order to remain at rest with respect to the fixed stars.
The redshift which an asymptotic observer measures for light emitted from a source
“at rest” (u proportional to k) outside the static limit is (see (2.126))

2 /g 2 this is equivalent to
Ω 2 = gtϕ

gtt gϕϕ − gtϕ

Alternatively, this critical surface can be described as a result of (8.196) and (8.197)
as
α2 = 0

or Δ = 0.

(8.215)

8 Black Holes

Sometimes it is useful to formulate this as follows: Let
ξ = k + Ωm,

(8.216)

then (8.214) is equivalent to ξ being lightlike, ξ, ξ  = 0. We shall see further below
that this hypersurface H is an event horizon (for M 2 > a 2 + Q2 ). Explicitly H is
given by (see 8.192)

r = rH := M + M 2 − a 2 − Q2 .
(8.217)
On the hypersurface H the angular velocity Ω becomes according to (8.211)
Ω|H =: ΩH =

a(2MrH − Q2 )
2 + a 2 )2
(rH

or, using (8.217),
ΩH =

a
2 + a2
rH

(= const).

(8.218)

This is a very remarkable result: The black hole rotates like a rigid body. We have
obtained this fact from the explicit formulas. In Appendix 8.8.1 we shall give a
general argument why Ω has to be constant on the horizon. Because of this,
l := k + ΩH m

(8.219)

is a Killing field, coinciding on H with ξ , and is thus null on H . The flow of the
vector field l leaves the horizon invariant, because
Ll l, l = 0.

(8.220)

Indeed, since l is a Killing field we have


Ll l, l = (Ll g)(l, l) + 2 [l, l], l = 0.
So any hypersurface {l, l = const} is left invariant. In particular, the Killing field l
is a tangent null vector of H .
Next, we show that H is a null hypersurface, that is, normal vectors are lightlike.
This can again be seen from the explicit formulas for the metric. Since ξ and l
coincide on H , it suffices to show that the gradient of ξ, ξ  becomes lightlike on H .
From (recall Ω = −gtϕ /gϕϕ )
ξ, ξ  = −α 2 = −

ρ2
Δ,
Σ2

and because g rr is proportional to Δ, we see that ∇α 2 , ∇α 2  indeed vanishes on H .
We now state a theorem which demonstrates what is behind these results. The
formulation makes use of concepts introduced in Sect. 8.3.1, and the proof of the
theorem will be given in Appendix 8.8.1 of this chapter.

8.4 Discussion of the Kerr–Newman Family

Theorem 8.1 (Weak rigidity theorem) Let (M, g) be a circular spacetime with commuting Killing fields k, m and let ξ = k + Ωm with Ω = −k, m/m, m. Then Ω
is constant on the hypersurface Sξ = {ξ, ξ  = 0}, assumed to exist. Moreover, Sξ is
a null hypersurface, invariant under the isometry group R × SO(2).
The hypersurface Sξ is a Killing horizon in the sense of the following
Definition 8.1 Let K be a Killing field and HK the set of points where K is null,
and not identically vanishing. A connected component of this set which is a null
hypersurface, and any union of such null surfaces is a Killing horizon (generated by
K).
Obviously, Sξ = Hl , where l is, as in (8.219), the Killing field
l := k + ΩH m,

ΩH := Ω|H .

Any hypersurface {l, l = const} is left invariant under the action of the isometry
group R × SO(2). In particular, the Killing fields l is a tangent null vector of Hl .
We emphasize that the notion of a Killing horizon is—in contrast to the one of
the event horizon—of a local nature. It is natural to expect that the event horizon
of a stationary black hole is a Killing horizon. That this is indeed true has been
proven only relatively recently as part of a corrected version of the so-called “strong
rigidity theorem”. In addition, this theorem states6 that K is either the stationary
Killing field (non-rotating black hole) or spacetime is axisymmetric (rotating black
hole).
In what follows we consider mainly black holes of static and circular spacetimes.7 For the latter case the event horizon agrees with the Killing horizon Hl . This
is not very difficult to prove; see [267], Theorem 4.2.
Since a Killing horizon is a null hypersurface, the tangent space at each point is
orthogonal to a null vector, and therefore does not contain timelike vectors. Moreover, the set of null vectors is one-dimensional and spanned by any normal vector.
(This, and other algebraic facts will be proven in Exercise 8.5.) In other words, a
Killing horizon is tangent to the light cone at each point. Therefore, crossing is
possible in only one direction.
In the situation above l is as a null vector tangent to H also proportional to a
normal vector field on H , i.e.,
dN = −2κl,

N := l, l.

(8.221)

6 For a precise formulation and a complete proof we refer to [280]. Unfortunately, so far the unjustified hypothesis of analyticity of the metric in a neighbourhood of the event horizon had to be
made.
7 For certain matter models, for instance for source-free electromagnetic fields, this exhausts all
stationary black holes (circularity and staticity theorems).

474

Fig. 8.2 Cross section

a Kerr–Newman solution

The proportionality factor κ is the surface gravity of the Killing horizon, and will
play an important role. Instead of (8.221) we can write
∇l l = κl,

(8.222)

dN = dil l = −il dl = 2il ∇l = −2∇l l.

(8.223)

because for a Killing field we have

(We have used DG, Eq. (15.104); in index notation (8.223) follows immediately
from the Killing equation.)
Equation (8.222) tells us that the integral curves of l are non-affinely parameterized geodesics. (Show that by an appropriate re-parametrization these integral
curves satisfy the standard geodesic equation.) These null geodesics generate the
Killing horizon. For a more general discussion, see DG, Appendix A, especially
Proposition A.1.
The static limit is timelike, except at the poles (critical points of m), because
a normal vector to the static hypersurface, being orthogonal to the null vector k
and m, cannot be timelike.8 Therefore, one can pass through this surface in both
directions, in contrast to the Killing horizon. The region between the static limit and
this horizon is the so-called ergosphere (for reasons which will be clarified later).
The static limit and the horizon come together at the poles (see Fig. 8.2). Inside the
ergosphere, k is spacelike. This implies that “all the king’s horses and all the king’s
men” cannot prevent on observer from rotating about the black hole. The ergosphere
disappears when a −→ 0.
We add some remarks about Killing horizons for static spacetimes, for which the
stationary Killing field satisfies the Frobenius condition k ∧ dk = 0 (vanishing twist
ω). From the general identity (see (8.105))
N dK, dK = dN, dN − 4ω, ω
8 Note that k is tangent to the static limit since by (8.220) L k, k = 0. If the normal would be
k

null, then it would be proportional to k, but then it could not be perpendicular to m, except at the
poles (where the normal is actually null).

8.4 Discussion of the Kerr–Newman Family

475

for a Killing field K we conclude that dN is null on the surface Sk = {k, k = 0}. In
other words, for the non-degenerate case dN = 0 the hypersurface Sk is the Killing
horizon Hk . In [267], Theorem 4.1, it is shown that the event horizon of a (nondegenerate) static black hole coincides with Hk .
Exercise 8.5 Let V be an n-dimensional Minkowski vector space with inner product ·, ·. Prove the following facts:
(a) Two timelike vectors are never orthogonal.
(b) A timelike vector is never orthogonal to a null vector.
(c) Two null vectors are orthogonal if and only if they are linearly dependent.
(d) The orthogonal complement of a null vector is an (n − 1)-dimensional subspace
of V in which the inner product is positive semi-definite and has rank n − 2.
Solution Fix a timelike unit vector u. Any vector x ∈ V can be uniquely decomposed in the form
x = λu + y,

u, y = 0.

The scalar λ is given by
λ = −x, u.
From this decomposition all four properties can be established. As an example we
prove (c).—Let l1 and l2 be two orthogonal null vectors. Then we have the decompositions
l1 = λ 1 u + y 1 ,

l2 = λ 2 u + y 2 ,

with
l1 , l2  = 0 = −λ1 λ2 + y1 , y2 .

(8.224)

Since λ21 = y1 , y1  and λ22 = y2 , y2 , we obtain the equation
y1 , y1 y2 , y2  = y1 , y2 2 .
The vectors y1 and y2 are contained in the orthogonal complement of u. In this
subspace the inner product is positive definite, and hence the last equation implies
that y1 and y2 are linearly dependent, y2 = λy1 . Inserting this in (8.224), we find
λ2 = λλ1 , whence l2 = λl1 .

8.4.5 Coordinate Singularity at the Horizon and Kerr Coordinates
For Δ = 0 (see (8.192)) the Kerr metric expressed in terms of the Boyer–Lindquist
coordinates appears singular. However, this is as in the case of the Schwarzschild
solution merely a coordinate singularity, as can be seen by transforming to the socalled Kerr coordinates. These new coordinates are generalizations of the (ingoing)

(8.225)

Note that the exterior differential of the right-hand sides vanish. The metric can be
written in terms of the new coordinates (Ṽ , r, ϑ, ϕ̃) as follows



(8.226)
This expression is regular at the horizon. In place of Ṽ one often uses t˜ = Ṽ − r. In
terms of the Kerr coordinates, the Killing fields k and m are given by
 
 
∂

m=

(8.227)
k=
∂ ϕ̃ t˜,r,ϑ
∂ t˜ r,ϑ,ϕ̃
These coordinates are for instance useful in studies of physical processes close
to the horizon, because one does not have to impose boundary conditions but must
only require that physical quantities (electromagnetic fields, etc.) remain finite at the
horizon.

8.4.6 Singularities of the Kerr–Newman Metric
The Kerr–Newman metric has a true singularity which lies inside the horizon for
M 2 > a 2 + Q2 . It has a rather complicated structure, which is described in detail in
[10]. The maximal analytic continuation of the Kerr solution is also discussed there.
The global structure turns out to be very similar to that of the Reissner–Nordstrøm
solution. These aspects have no relevance for astrophysics and hence will not be
treated here.

8.4.7 Structure of the Light Cones and Event Horizon
Visualizing the spacetime geometry is made easier by considering the structure of
the light cones. We examine this more closely in the equatorial plane, as indicated in
Fig. 8.3. Each point in this plane represents an integral curve of the Killing field k.
The wave fronts of light signals which have formed shortly after being emitted from
the marked points are also shown in Fig. 8.3. We note the following facts:

8.4 Discussion of the Kerr–Newman Family

477

Fig. 8.3 Structure of light
cones in the equatorial plane

Fig. 8.4 Penrose mechanism

(a) Since k is timelike outside the static limit, the points of emission are inside the
wave fronts.
(b) At the static limit k becomes lightlike, and the point of emission lies thus on the
wave front.
(c) Inside the ergosphere k is spacelike and hence the emitting points are outside
the wave fronts.
(d) For r = rH , the Killing field k is still spacelike, but the wave fronts arising
from a point of emission on this surface lie entirely inside the surface, except
for touching points, because r = rH (i.e. Δ = 0) is a null surface. This demonstrates that this surface is indeed an event horizon. This lightlike hypersurface
is invariant with respect to k and m (prove this or see Appendix 8.8.1).

8.4.8 Penrose Mechanism
Since k is spacelike inside the ergosphere, it is possible in principle to extract energy
from a black hole, thereby reducing its angular velocity and thus also the size of
the ergosphere. Imagine, as a gedankenexperiment, a piece of matter which falls
freely from a large distance into the ergosphere, as indicated in Fig. 8.4, where it
breaks up into two fragments, in such a way that E1 := −p1 , k < 0. Here p, p1
and p2 are the corresponding four-momenta, and p = p1 + p2 . It is important that
p, k is constant along a geodesic. The scalar product −p, k is also the asymptotic
energy of the particle. Since E = −p, k = −p1 , k − p2 , k, we see that E2 =
−p2 , k > E. Hence, the second fragment can leave the ergosphere and carry away

478

8 Black Holes

more energy than the incoming object had. This process, called Penrose mechanism,
could provide simultaneously permanent solutions to our energy and waste disposal
problems.
An astrophysically interesting possibility to extract the rotational energy from a
black hole has been suggested in [255]. This so-called Blandford–Znajek process
can work if rotation and turbulence in an accretion disk around a black hole generates sufficiently large magnetic fields. A detailed treatment of this magnetic energy
extraction is given in [256] and [257]. For a more recent review, see e.g. [258].

8.4.9 Geodesics of a Kerr Black Hole
The description of the geodesics for the Kerr solution is far more complicated than
for the Schwarzschild metric. The problem is, however, completely integrable. Surprisingly, it turns out that beside the three obvious first integrals of motion there
is a fourth one. This was discovered by B. Carter (see [259]) with the help of the
Hamilton–Jacobi method. Since we know of no other way to discover this hidden
symmetry, we briefly remind the reader how this works.

8.4.10 The Hamilton–Jacobi Method
We know that the geodesic equation can be regarded as the Euler–Lagrange equation
for the Lagrangian

 1
L x μ , ẋ ν = gμν ẋ μ ẋ ν .
(8.228)
2
From this we can pass to a Hamiltonian description. The canonical momenta are
pμ =

∂L
= gμν ẋ ν ,
∂ ẋ μ

(8.229)

and hence the Hamiltonian function is given by

 1
H x μ , pν = g μν pμ pν .
2

(8.230)

The symplectic form on the phase space is the standard one:
ω = dq μ ∧ dpμ .

are equivalent to the geodesic equations. (There is a very geometrical way to describe all this; see, e.g., [39].)
The Hamilton–Jacobi method of solving the system of canonical equations
(8.231) consists of the following (see, e.g., [33]): Construct a complete solution9
S(x μ , λ; αν ) of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation


∂S

depending on four parameters αν (equal to the number of degrees of freedom). Then
the orbits x μ (λ), pν (λ) are determined by
pμ =

∂S

∂x μ

(8.233)

βμ =

∂S

∂αμ

(8.234)

and

where αμ and β ν are constants. (S is the generating function of a canonical transformation (x μ , pν ) −→ (β μ , αν ), with the property that the transformed Hamilton
equations become trivial: β̇ μ = 0, α̇ν = 0.)
For autonomous systems, as our geodesics problem, one can separate the “time”
dependence of S:
 
1
S = μ2 λ + W x μ ,
2

(8.235)

where μ is a constant. Then W satisfies the reduced Hamilton–Jacobi equation



(8.236)

For our problem this becomes
g μν

∂W ∂W
+ μ2 = 0.
∂x μ ∂x ν

(8.237)

Since, by (8.233), pμ = ∂W/∂x μ it is clear that μ is the rest mass of the particle,
g μν pμ pν + μ2 = 0.

9 By this one means that det(∂ 2 S/∂q μ ∂α ) = 0. Such solutions always exist locally.

The coefficients of this partial differential equation are independent of t and ϕ. To
find a complete solution we therefore try the separation ansatz
W = −Et + Lz ϕ + Sr (r) + Sϑ (ϑ),

(8.241)

where E and Lz are constants. For their interpretation we note that (8.233) gives for
t and ϕ
pt = −E,

pϕ = L z .

(8.242)

p, m = Lz

(8.243)

These two conservation laws are just
p, k = −E,

we get rid of the integrals and arrive at a system of first order equations ẋ μ =

quadratures.
While this solves the problem theoretically, it is difficult to understand the orbit
structure analytically. This is an example where computer animations can help. We
discuss here only a very special class of orbits which is, however, of considerable
astrophysical interest.

For a < M the function γ (r) becomes at this point infinite. Qualitatively, γ (r) has
the shape shown in Fig. 8.5, with a minimum at some radius larger than the one
determined by (8.257). We claim that this critical radius corresponds to a marginally
stable circular orbit. To prove this, let us write (8.253) in the form
ṙ 2 + V (r; γ , l) = 0,
with an effective potential V . The circular orbits correspond to critical points of this
one-dimensional problem with ‘energy’ equal to zero: V = 0 and V  ≡ ∂V /∂r = 0.
The expressions (8.254a) and (8.254b) are the solutions of these two equations.

Stability of the circular orbit with radius r requires V  ≥ 0. The marginally stable orbit corresponds to V  = 0. For this the last system of equations implies that
dγ /dr = 0 and dl/dr = 0. Physically it is clear that these extrema are minima.
Marginally bound circular orbits correspond to γ = 1. Their radial coordinate is
rmb = 2M ∓ a + 2M 1/2 (M ∓ a)1/2 .

(8.258)

The analytical expression for the radius rms of the marginally stable circular
orbits is rather complicated (see [260]). We consider here only the two limiting cases
a = 0 and a −→ M. For the Schwarzschild solution rms = 6M, and for a −→ M
we have rms = M (co-rotating) or 9M (retrograde). Of great interest is the binding
energy of the marginally stable circular orbit. This is determined by

From this one finds that γ decreases from 8/9 for a = 0 to 1/ 3 in√the extreme
limit for co-rotating orbits. In the other case the value increases from 8/9 to
√
25/27. For the first case, if a particle can spiral down in an accretion
disk from far
√
away to the innermost circular stable orbit, the fraction 1 − 1/ 3 of the rest energy
is set free. Thus, a rotating black hole allows a gravitational energy conversion up to
≃ 42.3%. This enormous efficiency is the main reason why the existence of supermassive black holes in the centres of quasars and other active galactic nuclei11 has
been suggested already quite early.
Remark For a recent application of (8.256) to the super-massive black hole in our
Galaxy, see [284].

8.5 Accretion Tori Around Kerr Black Holes
It is now generally believed that the energy source of quasars and other active galactic nuclei involves accretion of matter onto a super-massive black hole, i.e., a black
hole of 108 –109 solar masses, because this is an efficient way to convert rest mass
into radiation in a relatively small region of space (approximatively the dimension of
the solar system). Although we do not have a detailed picture, the formation of such
holes in the cores of some galaxies is quite plausible. A super-massive black hole
can easily be fed by sufficient material from its surroundings (a few solar masses per
year) to generate in a small volume the enormous luminosities of about 1047 erg/s
11 Active galactic nuclei produce prodigious luminosities in tiny volumes (in some cases as much
as 104 times the luminosity of a typical galaxy in much less than 1 pc3 ). This radiation can emerge
over an extraordinarily broad range of frequencies. For a text book presentation of active galactic
nuclei, see e.g. [281].

observed from quasars. A useful number to compare with this is the Eddington luminosity,


(8.260)
LEdd = 1.3 × 1046 MH /108 M erg/s,
which corresponds to the mass MH of the black hole. If the radiation efficiency of
the infalling gas is 0.15, then the accretion rate Ṁ is given by 0.15Ṁc2 = LEdd or
Ṁ ≃ 1.3(MH /108 M )M yr−1 . When the mass accretion rate is close to LEdd ,
the inner accretion disk around the black hole will thicken (see for instance [16]).
It turns out that in that part the radiation pressure dominates and the opacity is
determined mainly by electron scattering. Under these circumstances a structure
may form close to the horizon which looks like a torus.
In this section we will study these accretion tori for a simple matter model in
some detail. We shall see that the relativistic tori have new, qualitatively important
features. The study of such thick accretion disks is probably also important for an
understanding of the formation of well collimated pairs of energetic jets.

8.5.1 Newtonian Approximation
It is instructive to first study the problem in the Newtonian approximation.—In
cylindrical coordinates (s, ϕ, z) we assume that the velocity field of matter has the
form
vs = 0,

vϕ = sΩ(s, z),

vz = 0.

(8.261)

Then the radial and the z-component of the Euler equation become
1
∂s p = −∂s φ + sΩ 2 ,
ρ

1
∂z p = −∂z φ.
ρ

(8.262)

Together they can be written as
1
dp = −dφ + Ω 2 s ds.
ρ

If we take the differential of this we find
 
1
∧ dp = 2Ωs dΩ ∧ ds = 2Ωs∂z Ω dz ∧ ds
d
ρ
= 2∂z Ω ∗ v,

(8.264)

where ∗v is the dual of the velocity 1-form
v = Ωs 2 dϕ.

(8.265)

Now we make the model assumption that we have a barotropic situation: p = p(ρ).
It should be noted that this is not necessarily the equation of state. For instance,

8.5 Accretion Tori Around Kerr Black Holes

487

if ∂z Ω = 0 such a relation has to hold as a consequence of (8.264), whatever the
equation of state is. For a barotrope the left-hand side of (8.264) vanishes and therefore the function Ω must be independent of z: Ω = Ω(s), i.e., Ω is constant on
cylinders. This is a so-called von Zeipel relation. For this situation it is convenient
to introduce the rotational potential V by dV = −Ω 2 s ds, i.e.,
 s
Ω 2 (s)s ds,
(8.266)
V =−
sin

where sin corresponds to the inner boundary of the disk. Then (8.263) becomes
1
dp = −dψ,
ρ

ψ := φ + V .

(8.267)

Thus, isobaric surfaces and surfaces of constant density are just equipotential surfaces of ψ . This analysis leads to the following procedure:
1. Choose a “von Zeipel relation”
Ω = Ω(s)

(8.268)

and determine V .
2. With the Newtonian potential φ from the central object,

(8.271)

which gives V = l 2 /2s 2 , and

The corresponding equipotential surfaces are shown in Fig. 8.6. One sees that the
thick disk possesses a narrow funnel along the rotation axis of the central object
along which large radiative pressure gradients can, perhaps, accelerate matter in
collimated jets. This is the standard picture for the formation of well collimated jets
in opposite directions. One should note in this connection that the binding energy of
material near the surface of the funnel is relatively low and thus radiation pressure
may easily propel matter to escape to infinity. Other acceleration mechanisms may,
however, be more important. In particular, magnetic fields appear to play a crucial
role (see, e.g., [258] and references therein).

8.5.2 General Relativistic Treatment
We consider now a stationary and axisymmetric flow of an ideal fluid in the gravitational field of a Kerr black hole. Lie derivatives of physical quantities, like the
pressure p and the four-velocity u of the ideal fluid, with respect to the Killing
fields k = ∂t and m = ∂ϕ have to vanish.
The four-velocity u has the form
u = ut (k + Ωm).

This generalizes the Newtonian result (8.271).
In Fig. 8.7 the surfaces (8.280) are shown for l = 3.77M. Matter can fill each of
the closed equipotential surfaces (for which W < 0). In comparison to the Newtonian result the most important new phenomenon is the appearance of a sharp cusp
on the inner edge of the accretion torus, which is near the marginally stable circular
orbit. This acts like the inner Lagrange point in a close binary system; the gas falls
from the disk over the cusp toward the black hole with no dissipation of the angular
momentum. Therefore, the accretion is driven by pressure gradient forces and viscosity is not necessary.—Note that, qualitatively, one finds the same result for Kerr
black holes. An example is shown in Fig. 8.8. For a more detailed discussion we
refer to [276, 277].

8.5.3 Footnote: Derivation of Eq. (8.276)
First we note that the last term in (8.275) vanishes because Lu p = 0. Let u be the
1-form belonging to u. Then we have
(Lu u)μ = uν uμ,ν + uν uν,μ = uν uμ;ν + uν uν;μ = (∇u u)μ .

(8.281)

Next, we compute Lφu u, with φ := 1/ut , in two different ways:
(a) Lφu u = φLu u + dφ ∧ iu u = φ∇u u − dφ;
(b) Lφu u = Lk+Ωm u = dΩ ∧ im u = j dΩ .
By comparison we find
φ∇u u = j dΩ + dφ = de − Ω dj.

8.6 The Four Laws of Black Hole Dynamics
In principle it is possible to extract an enormous amount of energy from a rotating
black hole, thereby reducing its angular velocity and thus also the size of the ergosphere. The fraction of rotational energy that can ideally be extracted is limited by
what is called the second law of black hole dynamics, which implies that the surface
of a black hole cannot decrease. The general form of this area law, formulated later
in this section, is in close formal analogy with the second law of thermodynamics.
Not only the second law, but also the other main laws of thermodynamics have close
analogies in the physics of black holes.
While the formal analogy between these two sets of laws has been established
very early (∼ 1973), the question of whether there is deep physical reason behind
this, is still a matter of research. A first important step in this direction was made
by S. Hawking’s discovery of thermal radiation by black holes in a semi-classical
approach (quantized matter fields on a classical black hole background).
In this section we give only an introduction to the classical aspects of the subject.
For more information the reader is referred to the cited literature.

8.6.1 General Definition of Black Holes
Until now we never gave a technically precise definition of a black hole and its event
horizon, since physically it is clear what is meant by these concepts. With the help
of the conformal description of asymptotic flatness, discussed in Sect. 6.1, a concise
mathematical definition can be given.
For this we consider the causal past of future null infinity, denoted by J − (I + ).
This is the set of all events p ∈ M for which there is a future pointing causal curve
(non-spacelike tangent vectors), starting at p and ending on I + . We say that the
physical spacetime M contains a black hole if J − (I + ) does not contain all of M.
The complement



is the black hole region, and
H := ∂B
is its (future) event horizon. (The time reflected notion of past event horizons is not
of astrophysical interest, as was already remarked in connection with Schwarzschild
black holes.) Being a causal boundary, one expects that H is a null hypersurface.
We shall see later in Appendix 8.8.9 that this is indeed the case (ignoring for the
moment possible breakdowns of differentiability).

8.6.2 The Zeroth Law of Black Hole Dynamics
In the formal relationship, alluded to in the introductory remarks, the analogue
of the temperature is the surface gravity, which was introduced in Sect. 8.4.4 for
Killing horizons (see (8.221) and (8.222)). The analogue of the zeroth law of
thermodynamics—the constancy of the (absolute) temperature T throughout a body
in thermal equilibrium—is the constancy of the surface gravity κ over the horizon of
a stationary black hole. We shall prove this constancy for Killing horizons of static
and circular spacetimes. It holds, however, also under other assumptions.
The details of the general argument will be given in Appendix 8.8.2 of this chapter. Here, we compute κ for the Kerr–Newman family. Before doing this we want to
interpret κ, and derive alternative formulas for this quantity.

8.6.3 Surface Gravity
For the interpretation of the surface gravity on an arbitrary Killing horizon H belonging to a Killing field K (see Definition 8.1), we consider integral curves of K
in the region where K is timelike (outer domain of communication). Their fourvelocities are
u = K/(−N )1/2 ,

N = K, K.

(8.284)

The acceleration of a stationary observer along such an integral curve is

(8.285)

since LK N = 0. The magnitude a, a diverges at the horizon, but by a suitable
renormalization (measuring the time in terms of the asymptotic time) we obtain a
finite result. We claim that
κ = lim(−N )1/2 a, a1/2 ,

(8.286)

as the horizon is approached. (Recall that (−N )1/2 is the redshift factor, as in
(8.213).)

Here, we use the general identity (8.105),
N dK, dK = dN, dN − 4ω, ω,

(8.289)

(8.290)

where ω is the twist form of K. On the horizon this twist vanishes. This follows
immediately from the fact that on H the null vector K must be proportional to
the gradient of N . (Introduce local coordinates such that N is one of them and the
remaining ones parameterize locally the hypersurface H . Then K ∧ dK = 0 on H
becomes obvious.) With this we obtain
1
lim(−N )a, a = − dK, dK|H .
4

(8.291)

Finally, we show that the right-hand side of (8.291) is equal to κ 2 , proving our
claim (8.286). For the derivation of
1
κ 2 = − dK, dK|H ,
4

(8.292)

we start from the evident identity
iK (dK ∧ ∗dK) = −dN ∧ ∗dK + 2dK ∧ ω.
Here, the left-hand side is equal to dK, dK ∗ K. (To see this, use (8.79) for α = 1
and ∗1 = η.) For the right-hand side we obtain on the horizon, using the original
definition (8.221) of κ, i.e., dN = −2κK on H ,
−dN ∧ ∗dK = 2κK ∧ ∗dK = −2κ ∗ iK dK
= 2κ ∗ dN = −4κ 2 ∗ K.
This proves (8.292).
For circular spacetimes a closely related formula is easier to work out in the case
of the Kerr–Newman family. Consider for a circular spacetime the vector field ξ =

k + Ωm introduced earlier (see (8.216)). We know from the weak rigidity theorem
that H = {ξ, ξ  = 0} is a Killing horizon, and that ΩH is constant on H . Therefore
l = k + ΩH m is a Killing field that plays the role of K in the considerations above.
From ξ = l + (Ω − ΩH )m we get
dξ = dl + (Ω − ΩH ) dm + dΩ ∧ m.
But dΩ is normal to H , thus proportional to l, therefore the first and the last term
on the right are orthogonal. This follows from
∗dl ∧ l ∧ m = − ∗ il dl ∧ m = −2κ ∗ l ∧ m = −2κl, mη,
and l, m|H = 0. As a result we have
dξ, dξ |H = dl, dl|H + dΩ ∧ m, dΩ ∧ m|H
but here the last term vanishes, since it is proportional to l ∧ m, l ∧ m|H =
l, lm, m − l, m2 on the Killing horizon. Thus we obtain the formula
1
κ 2 = − dξ, dξ |H
4

(8.293)

for the surface gravity.
In adapted coordinates with k = ∂t , m = ∂ϕ we have in terms of the lapse function α
ξ = −α 2 dt,

dξ = −2α dα ∧ dt,

and
dξ, dξ  = 4α 2 dα, dαdt, dt = −4dα, dα.
Thus we obtain the useful formula
κ 2 = dα, dα|H .

(8.294)

Let us apply this to the Kerr–Newman
family. For this the lapse function α is

In particular we see that the surface gravity is constant, a fact that is called the zeroth
law of black hole dynamics.
This explicit calculation does not shed much light on why this is so. In Appendix 8.8.2 we show that the zeroth law is a purely geometrical property of Killing
horizons for static and for circular spacetimes.

The combination of (8.296) and (8.297) is often called the first law, although an
important part of thesecond law of thermodynamics is also integrated (otherwise we
cannot speak of entropy).
In black hole physics, the analogue of the thermodynamic potential U (S, V ,
N, . . .) is the total mass as a function of the surface area A of the horizon, the
angular momentum J , the electric charge Q and perhaps other quantities for certain
matter models. That A is the “right” choice will become clear later.

8.6.5 Surface Area of Kerr–Newman Horizon
In Boyer–Lindquist coordinates the induced metric ḡ of the horizon for fixed t is
according to (8.193) and (8.195) given by
ḡ = gϑϑ dϑ 2 + gϕϕ dϕ 2 = ρ 2 dϑ 2 +

8.6.7 The First Law for Circular Spacetimes
Again, one would like to see a more general derivation of the first law (8.307), that
does not depend on the explicit solution. We closely follow here the derivation given
in [246], where also the relevant original papers are quoted, and various generalizations (e.g., [261, 262] and [263]) are mentioned.

Mass Formula

JH is the Komar angular momentum integral over H (see (8.187)).
In a final step we evaluate the surface integral on the right in (8.311). For this we
make use of the following general fact. Consider an arbitrary 2-form Λ, and let n be

the second future-directed null vector orthogonal to H, normalized as n, l = −1.
Then
∗Λ|H = (in ◦ il Λ) volH ,

(8.313)

where volH is the induced volume form on H, also denoted by dA in what follows.
The proof of this formula is simple: On H the 2-form ∗Λ can be represented as
∗Λ = λ volH with a function λ. Taking the wedge product of this equation with l ∧ n
gives Λ, l ∧ nη = λη, where η is the canonical volume form of spacetime. From
this one obtains λ = in ◦ il Λ.

Variations
We would like to obtain a formula for the variation of M which generalizes (8.307).
Variations of (8.315) or (8.316) contain, for instance, the term A dκ that does not
appear in (8.307). Therefore, we shall work out in a first step this contribution.
We begin with some preparations. In what follows we shall always consider equilibrium variations, like in thermostatics. From (8.71) and (8.72) one sees that the
gauge can be chosen such that the action of R × SO(2) remains unchanged, whence
the variations of the Killing fields k and m vanish
δk μ = δmμ = 0.

(8.317)

Let hμν := δgμν . Raising and lowering of indices of this perturbation are performed
with the unperturbed metric gμν ; in particular, we thus have hμν = −δg μν . From
(8.317) we obtain for the variations of the covectors kμ , mμ
δkμ = hμν k ν ,

δmμ = hμν mν ,

(8.318)

δlμ = hμν l ν + δΩH mμ .

(8.319)

implying
δl μ = δΩH mμ ,

8.6 The Four Laws of Black Hole Dynamics

499

Without loss of generality we can assume that the position of the horizon remains
unchanged.12 Note that this is consistent with (8.317).
Since l is tangent to H , l + δl is normal to l with respect to the perturbed metric
g + h. Furthermore, l + δl is null relative to the perturbed metric, hence this is also
the case for l. This implies that δl must be proportional to l, i.e., l ∧ δl = 0 on H . As
a result of our gauge choice it follows that the variation of l remains invariant under
the group action, implying the second of the following two variational equations
l ∧ δl = 0,

Ll δl = 0.

(8.320)

Later we shall need two further variational equations. Since the two null vector
fields l, n are orthogonal to the spacelike 2-surface H, and δl is proportional to
l, it follows that δn is proportional to n. In order to preserve the normalization
n, l = −1 the variations of l and n must be of the form δl = f l, δn = −f n with a
function f , implying that
nμ δlν + δnμ lν = 0.

(8.321)

iX iY d(δl) = 0,

(8.322)

The other relation on H is

for arbitrary vector fields X, Y tangent to the horizon. To show this, we recall that
the twist of l vanishes (see Sect. 8.6.2), hence 0 = iX iY (l ∧ dl) = l(iX iY dl) and
thus iX iY dl = 0. From this we get
iX iY d(δl) = iX iY d(f l) = iX iY (df ∧ l + f dl) = 0.

Variation of κ
Contracting the definition (8.221) of κ with n gives


2κ = nμ ∇μ l ν lν .
Variation of this equation leads in a first step to






2δκ = δnμ ∇μ l ν lν + nμ ∇μ l ν δlν + nμ ∇μ lν δl ν .
The second term on the right can be written as

 

nμ ∇μ l ν δlν = l ν nμ + l μ nν ∇μ δlν + 2nμ δlν ∇μ l ν ,
where we have added the vanishing term nμ (Ll δl)μ , i.e.,


nμ l ν ∇ν δlμ + δlν ∇μ l ν = 0.
12 Perform, if necessary, a transformation of the coordinates x A in (8.72).

Using this last equation, we can write the third term in (8.323) as

 

nμ ∇μ lν δl ν = lν nμ − l μ nν ∇μ δl ν .
Thus we get




(8.324)

According to (8.321) the second term on the right vanishes. Equation (8.322) implies
that the first term can be written in terms of the covariant derivative of δlμ
ν μ

l n + l μ nν ∇μ δlν = −∇ μ δlμ .
Here, we have used that l ν nμ + l μ nν = −g μν + . . . , where the dotted terms give
according to (8.322) no contribution to the left hand side. By (8.319), the Killing
equation and the constancy of δΩH we have


∇ μ δlμ = ∇ μ hν μ lν + δΩH mμ = lν ∇ μ hν μ = 2l, h,
where hμ := ∇ [ν hμ] ν . (In the last step we used that the derivative of hμ μ in the
direction of the Killing field l vanishes on H .) The last term in (8.324) is by (8.319)
and the Killing equation equal to
 μ

lν n − nν l μ δΩH ∇μ mν = 2δΩH l [ν nμ] ∇μ mν .
So we finally obtain on H

8.6.8 The Second Law of Black Hole Dynamics
The most general form of the second law is due to S. Hawking. It states the following:
Theorem 8.2 In any (classical) interaction of matter and radiation with black
holes, the total surface area of the boundaries of these holes (as formed by their
horizons) can never decrease.
The key idea of the proof is to use the following fact which was found previously by R. Penrose: Light rays generating a horizon never intersect. If one would
assume that null geodesic generators of a horizon begin to converge and the energy
density is always non-negative, then the focusing effect of the gravitational field
would lead to the intersection of light rays. One must therefore conclude that the
light rays generating the horizon cannot converge. This, in turn, implies that the surface area of a horizon cannot decrease. We shall elaborate on this in Appendix 8.8.9.
Some essential tools concerning congruences of null geodesics will be developed in
Appendix 8.8.3.
The limitation to classical interactions means that we do not consider changes in
the quantum theory of matter due to the presence of the strong external gravitational
fields of black holes. For macroscopic black holes, this is completely justified. If

surfaces of the black holes we
have A(∂B1 ) + A(∂B2 ) ≤
A(∂B3 )

“mini-holes” were to exist, quantum effects, such as spontaneous (Hawking) radiation, would become important.
As a special example, the second law implies that if two black holes collide and
coalesce to a single black hole, then the surface area of the resulting black hole is
larger than the sum of the surface of the event horizons of the two original black
holes (see Fig. 8.9).

isolated black hole interacts with matter and radiation. The maximum energy which
can be extracted when Q = 0 is according to (8.332)

(8.336)

In principle, a lot of energy can be released as gravitational radiation.
In Chap. 5 we discussed the exciting prospect that the coalescence of black holes
will be observed with the help of laser interferometers.
Table 8.1 summarizes our discussion. It should be stressed that within classical
theory the correspondence T ↔ κ should be regarded as formal, since the physical
temperature of a black hole is zero. The situation changes radically in quantum
theory, where the physical temperature is the Hawking entropy TH = κ/(2πk).
We add a few remarks on the third law. Its thermodynamic formulation by Nernst
asserts that the entropy of a system goes to zero (or a ‘universal’ constant) as T → 0.
The analogy of this does not hold in black hole physics. Indeed, for the Kerr family the extremal black holes (κ = 0) have area A = 8πM 2 = 8πJ , depending on
the state parameter J . (The corresponding Hawking entropy is S = 2πJ , in units
with  = c = k = G = 1.) In statistical mechanics the vanishing of the entropy as
T → 0 should be regarded as a property of the density of states near the ground
state in the thermodynamic limit. For illustration, consider an ideal gas in the volume V . The energy difference between the first excited state and the ground state
is about 2 /(mV 2/3 ). For V = 1 cm3 and m equal to the hydrogen mass we obtain
ΔE/k ≃ 5 × 10−15 K. Only for temperatures much smaller than this ridiculously
small temperature does the value of the ground state entropy become relevant. The
T 3 -dependence in Debye theory, for example, is a property of the density of states.

8.7 Evidence for Black Holes

505

It can be shown that the third law fails in some not at all contrived cases. For further
discussion, see [264].

8.7 Evidence for Black Holes
The evidence for black holes in some X-ray binary systems and for super-massive
black holes in galactic centres is still indirect, but has finally become overwhelming.
There is so far, however, little evidence that these collapsed objects are described by
the Kerr metric.—Before we have a closer look at the observational situation, let us
address the question of how black holes are formed.

8.7.1 Black Hole Formation
Stellar-mass black holes are inevitable end-products of the evolution of sufficiently
massive stars. This is simply because ‘cold’ self-gravitating matter could only exist
in a small mass range below a few solar masses (see Sect. 7.9) There is, on the other
hand, absolutely no reason for all the many massive stars (or associations of stars) to
get rid of sufficient mass in the course of their evolution in some violent processes
(supernovas), in order to be able to settle down in a cold final state (white dwarf,
neutron stars, quark star, . . .).
Realistic collapse studies are still vigorously pursued. Fully relativistic computer
simulations for the non-spherical case are in progress, but it will take some time
before these give a reliable picture and permit us to answer questions such as:
(a) When and how are black holes formed in stellar core collapse?
(b) How much mass is ejected from the outer layers of a centrally collapsing star?
(c) How much gravitation radiation and neutrino radiation is emitted? What are
their spectra?
(d) In which manner do the answers to these questions depend on the mass and the
angular momentum of the progenitor star?
(e) What are the effects of magnetic fields (a ‘smart’ question one can always ask)?
The following qualitative remarks about the realistic collapse can be made:
1. The formation of trapped surfaces is a stable phenomenon. A trapped surface is
a spacelike two-surface such that both outgoing and incoming families of futuredirected null geodesics orthogonal to it are converging, i.e., the expansion rate
θ for both families is negative (see Appendix 8.8.3). This implies that if such a
two-surface emitted an instantaneous flash of light, both the outgoing and ingoing wave fronts would be decreasing in area (see Eq. (8.400)). According to the
Proposition 8.1, the outgoing wave front would shrink to zero in a finite affine
distance, trapping within it all the material, because this cannot travel outwards

506

8 Black Holes

faster than light. (Illustrate this concept for the Schwarzschild–Kruskal spacetime.) Since trapped surfaces are formed in spherical collapse to a black hole,
the stability Cauchy development (see Sect. 3.8) implies that the formation of
trapped surfaces is generic.
A general theorem by Hawking and Penrose then implies that a ‘singularity’
must occur in the sense that spacetime is geodesically incomplete (see [10]).
According to the “cosmic censorship hypothesis”, this will be hidden behind an
event horizon.13 If this is the case, then not only the development of singularities,
but also the occurrence of horizons is a generic phenomenon.
2. Trapped surfaces, and thus also singularities and horizons, are presumably
formed whenever an isolated mass distribution becomes enclosed within a twodimensional surface S of circumference d ∼ 2πGM/c2 , i.e., if any two points
on S can be joined by a curve in S whose length is smaller than d. The trapped
surface then lies inside the horizon. (There are some exact results in this direction
(see [243])).
3. Calculations based on perturbation theory indicate that a black hole quickly (in
10−3 (M/M ) s) approaches a stationary state after it is formed. The emission
and partial reabsorption of gravitational waves is primarily responsible for this.
The black hole is then a member of the Kerr–Newman family and thus characterized by its mass, angular momentum and charge (the latter is likely to be negligible in all realistic cases.) These are the only properties of its previous history
which are retained. Reliable calculations of the gravitational radiation emitted
during this relaxation process are in progress.
In summary, we have acquired a crude picture of the realistic collapse by induction from the spherically symmetric case, a mixture of rigorous mathematical
results, physical arguments, extrapolation from perturbation calculations and faith.
It remains for the future to refine this picture by numerical simulations.
If a black hole is surrounded by matter, originating for example from a normal
star which forms a close binary system with the black hole, then the matter will
be sucked in by the black hole and heated up so strongly that it becomes a source
of intense X-ray radiation. This possibility leads to the next section, in which the
evidence for the existence of black holes in some X-ray binaries will be discussed.
How super-massive black holes are formed is not yet known, although a great
deal has been written on the subject. Possible evolutionary scenarios have to take
into account that there are luminous quasars even at redshift z > 6 (corresponding to an age of less than one billion years after the big bang), and that these
show already high metal abundances. An extreme example is the quasar SDSS
J114816.64+525150.3 at a redshift z = 6.41. There is strong evidence that this
quasar contains a supermassive black hole of about 3 × 109 M (see [282]).
So there was some time interval between “seed” black holes, originating from
an early generation of metal poor massive stars and the ignition of quasar activity.
13 There are various ‘physical’ and mathematical formulations of the cosmic censor conjecture (see,
e.g., [9]). Since nothing has been proven about the validity of the conjecture, we do not discuss this
issue.

8.7 Evidence for Black Holes

507

The problem is, however, that there are many e-foldings of mass that lie between
such black holes and a final mass of about 108 M . It is plausible that the seed black
holes grow hierarchically by mergers and gas accretion, but how this happens is
largely unknown. Since the formation processes of super-massive black holes are
not known, we do not discuss here proposed scenarios.

8.7.2 Black Hole Candidates in X-Ray Binaries
So far all the evidence that stellar mass black holes exist comes from dynamical studies of X-ray binaries.—In 1964, long before the X-ray window was really
opened by the famous satellite UHURU, Y.B. Zel’dovich first suggested the possibility that black holes may manifest themselves as compact X-ray sources in close
binary systems. Cygnus X-1, for a long time the solitary example of a black hole
candidate with firm supporting evidence, was located by UHURU within a few minutes of arc. By 1971 Cygnus X-1 was linked with a variable radio source which was
then more accurately pin-pointed by radio astronomers in Green Bank and Holland.
It was finally identified with the single-line spectroscopic binary HDE 226868 by
L. Webster, P. Murdin and C.T. Bolton. Using a large body of observational data,
D.R. Gies and Bolton derived a lower bound for the mass of the invisible massive
compact companion of 7M , with a preferred value of 16M (see [268]).
In December 1982, evidence of a massive invisible component in the extragalactic LMC X-3 was found (see [269]). In 1985, a third black hole candidate, A062000, was identified (see [270]).
To rule out the possibility that the compact companion of mass MX in a binary
system is a neutron star, it is necessary to show that MX is clearly above about
3M , the upper limit of neutron star masses (see Sect. 7.9). For this it is necessary
to establish a large but safe lower limit for MX . A very useful tool for this is the
optical mass function of the binary system, consisting of the compact object and a
visible star of mass Mopt :
f (MX , Mopt , i) =

(MX sin i)3
,
(MX + Mopt )2

(8.337)

where i is the inclination angle of the orbit (see Fig. 6.4 in Sect. 6.8.1). Using Kepler’s third law (6.192) we obtain alternatively
f (MX , Mopt , i) =

4π 2
(aopt sin i)3 .
GPb2

(8.338)

Here aopt sin i is the projected semi-major axis of the visible companion. In
Sect. 6.8.1 we saw that the radial velocity along the line of sight varies periodically
with an amplitude (often called K)
Vopt =

2π aopt sin i
,
√
Pb 1 − e2

(8.339)

508

8 Black Holes

where e is the eccentricity of the orbit. Inserting this in (8.338) gives
f (MX , Mopt , i) =

3/2 3
Pb 
1 − e2
Vopt .
2πG

(8.340)

Except for the eccentricity, the right-hand side contains only directly measurable
quantities. We also saw in Sect. 6.8.1 that the radial velocity curve, described by
(6.195), allows us also to determine e. So f (MX , Mopt , i) is observable, and from
(8.337) we see that this provides a lower limit for the mass MX :
MX ≥ f (MX , Mopt , i).

(8.341)

The main observational uncertainty comes from the radial velocity amplitude
Vopt , which can be affected by X-ray heating, tidal distortion, non-synchronous rotation of the companion, and spectral contamination due to the surrounding gas and
disk.
If the lower limit (8.340) is not good enough it may be possible to infer a (conservative) lower limit from additional information, for instance when no prominent
X-ray eclipses are observed. However, this introduces as a rule considerable uncertainties.
Among the many (over 200) X-ray binaries known in the Galaxy, about 30 are
transient sources, known as “X-ray nova” or “soft X-ray transients”. These sources
are characterized by episodic outbursts at X-ray, optical and radio frequencies, separated by long intervals (years to decades) of quiescence. In a quiescent state of an
X-ray nova, the absorption line velocities of the secondary star can be measured
precisely because the non-stellar light from the accretion flow is modest compared
to the light of the secondary. For such systems the mass function can therefore be
determined accurately.
At the time of writing more than a dozen X-ray nova with reliable measurements
of the mass function, have been found with f ≥ 3M (see [271]).

8.7.3 The X-Ray Nova XTE J118+480
Several soft X-ray transients are now known with a mass function larger than 6M ,
greatly exceeding the maximum mass of (not very rapidly rotating) neutron stars.
As an example we discuss briefly the X-ray transient XTE J1118+480, discovered in
2000 (for details see [272] and [273]). Later in that year the X-ray nova faded to near
its quiescent level, and spectroscopical as well as photometric data in quiescence
were soon obtained. In particular, an accurate radial velocity curve of the secondary
star was obtained (see Fig. 8.10). The data are well fitted for a circular orbit. In this
case Eqs. (6.193) and (6.195) give for the radial velocity

data gives the result (see [272])
Pb = 0.169930 ± 0.000004 d,

Vopt = 701 ± 10 km s−1 .

(8.343)

The corresponding mass function is
f (MX , Mopt , i) = 6.1 ± 0.3M .

(8.344)

This lower limit for MX is an important result. The spectral type of the secondary is
estimated to be K7V , and a plausible mass Mopt = 0.09–0.5M was obtained.
In conclusion, the spectroscopic, photometric and dynamical results give strong
evidence that XTE J1118+480 is a black hole X-ray system. This is the first one
found in the galactic halo (distance equal to 1.9 ± 0.4 kpc and 1.7 ± 0.4 kpc above
the Galactic plane).—For a list of other transient X-ray sources that presumably
contain black holes we refer to [271].

8.7.4 Super-Massive Black Holes
For a long time the best one could say about the evidence of super-massive black
holes in the centres of some galaxies, was that it was compelling if dynamical studies
and observations of active galactic nuclei were taken together. In the meantime the
situation has improved radically.
In Sect. 4.7 we already mentioned the beautiful work [140] which established
a dark mass concentration of about 4 × 106 M near the centre of the Milky Way,
whose extension is less than 17 light hours (see also [275]). If this were a cluster
of low mass stars or neutron stars, its central density would exceed 1017 M /pc3
and would not survive for more than a few 105 years. The least exotic interpretation of this enormous dark mass concentration is that it is a black hole. That this
is not the only possibility was illustrated in Exercise 7.6, where we showed that

510

8 Black Holes

a ball of fermions (e.g., neutrinos) for a certain range of fermion masses could in
principle account for this mass concentration. Alternatively, one can also cook up
bosonic star models. While such ways out are highly implausible, they illustrate
that dynamical studies can not give an incontrovertible proof of the existence of
black holes. Ideally, one would have to show that some black hole candidate has
an event horizon. There have been various attempts in this direction, but presumably only gravitational wave astronomy will reveal the essential properties of black
holes.
Most astrophysicists do not worry about possible remaining doubts. The evidence
for (super-massive) black holes is now so overwhelming that we can pass the burden
of proof against them to the hard-core skeptics.
The concentration of dark matter in the centre of the Milky Way is now the best
case for a super-massive black hole. Another very good case is provided by the
galaxy NGC 4258. The following observations show that the central mass of the
galaxy must be a black hole (or something even more exotic).—The peculiar spiral
galaxy NGC 4258 at a distance of about 6.5 Mpc has in its core a disk extending from about 0.2 to 0.13 pc in radius. This was discovered with a very precise
mapping of gas motions via the 1.3 cm maser-emission of H2 O with Very Long
Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). The angular resolution of the array was better than
0.5 milliarc seconds. (This is 100 times better than the resolution of the Hubble
Space Telescope.) The rotational velocity distribution in the disk follows an exact
Keplerian law around a compact dark mass, and the velocity of the inner edge is
1080 km/s. From this one infers a dark mass concentration of 3.6 × 107 M . As in
the case of the Milky Way, there are no long-lived star clusters with these extreme
properties. (For more details see [274].)
It is now generally accepted that most galaxies harbour dormant super-massive
black holes in their centre that were powering at an earlier time luminous quasars.
There is ample evidence that during the cosmic evolution galaxies interact and
merge as their dark matter halos assemble in a hierarchical fashion. As a result
one expects inevitable formation of black hole pairs in merged systems. These
will rapidly sink under the influence of dynamical friction against dark matter as
well as gas-dynamical friction, and will form Keplerian binaries on parsec scales.
The further evolution of such binaries is an important and much discussed issue.
At the time of writing it is not yet clear whether they will loose enough energy
and angular momentum to enter within less than a Hubble time a regime where
gravitational radiation alone will lead to inspiral and catastrophic collapse. Such
super-massive binary black hole mergers are so strong that they would be recorded
by the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) out to high redshift
(z ∼ 20).
Here, we only mention the discovery of two candidate black holes in the quasar
OJ287. This quasar shows quasi-perjodic optical outbursts at 12 yr interval, with
two outburst peaks per interval. As an explanation of this it has been proposed that
a secondary black hole pierces the accretion disk of the primary black hole and
thereby produces two impact flashes per period. However, alternative models have
also been suggested. The latest outburst occurred in September 2007, within a day

Mathematical Appendix on Black Holes

511

of the time predicted by the binary black hole model, if the loss of orbital energy
due to emission of gravitational waves is taken into account. Without this loss the
outburst would have happened twenty days later. The next major periodic outburst
is expected in early January 2016. It will be interesting to see whether the prediction
will be born out. For detailed information on this remarkable massive binary blackhole system in OJ287 we refer to [285].

Appendix: Mathematical Appendix on Black Holes
8.8.1 Proof of the Weak Rigidity Theorem
In this section we prove the weak rigidity theorem quoted in Sect. 8.4.4, making use
of the notation and tools developed in Sect. 8.3.1. For convenience, we repeat its
formulation
Theorem 8.3 (Weak rigidity theorem) Let (M, g) be a circular spacetime with commuting Killing fields k, m and let Ω = −k, m/m, m, ξ = k + Ωm. Then the hypersurface H = {ξ, ξ  = 0}, assumed to exist, is null, and Ω stays constant on H .
The null surface H is thus a Killing horizon.
Proof First, we establish that H is a null hypersurface. For this we introduce
σ = −k ∧ m, k ∧ m = V X + W 2 ,

(8.345)

where
V = −k, k,

W = k, m,

X = m, m.

(8.346)

Note that H is given by σ = 0. Conceptually it is clear that the hypersurfaces {σ =
const} are invariant under the isometry group R × SO(2), so that the vector fields k
and m are tangent to these surfaces. Analytically, this follows from

 

Lk W = (Lk g)(k, m) − [k, k], m − k, [k, m] = 0,
and similar equations. Therefore the gradient ∇σ is perpendicular to k and m,
i.e., ∇σ ∈ E ⊥ , where E is the integrable distribution spanned by the vector fields
k and m. Below we establish that on H the gradient ∇σ is also in E. Thus
∇σ |H ∈ E ∩ E ⊥ . This intersection is one-dimensional on H , and generated by the
null field ξ . (Verify that ξ ∈ E ⊥ on H .) Hence the normal ∇σ of H is null, proving
that H is lightlike.
Let us now calculate the gradient of σ . We have
dσ = 2W dW + X dV + V dX.

512

8 Black Holes

Here we use
dW = dik m = −ik dm,
dX = −im dm,

dW = −im dk,

dV = ik dk

to get
dσ = −W (ik dm + im dk) + Xik dk − V im dm.
Now, we multiply this equation from the right with (k ∧ m), and use in the resulting
expressions the Frobenius conditions (see (8.70)). These and the anti-derivation rule
for the interior product imply, for example
0 = ik (dm ∧ k ∧ m) = (ik dm) ∧ k ∧ m − V dm ∧ m − W dm ∧ k.
Collecting terms gives
dσ ∧ (k ∧ m) = σ d(k ∧ m).

(8.347)

Especially on H we get dσ ∧ (k ∧ m) = 0. At this point we make the generic assumption that the group action is such that k and m are linearly independent on H .
Then dσ must be a linear combination of k and m.—In [266] it is shown that the
non-degeneracy assumption just mentioned is not necessary, but this requires more
work.
The second part of the theorem, Ω|H =: ΩH = const follows with a similar argument. Let us look at the gradient of Ω. As before ∇Ω ∈ E ⊥ . On the other hand
we find in a first step
dΩ = −

(dW + Ω dX) = iξ dm.

iξ m = ξ, m = 0,

ξ, ξ m ∧ dm.
(8.348)

On H the right-hand side vanishes, and we again reach the conclusion that ∇Ω ∈ E,
thus ∇Ω is proportional to ξ . In other words ∇Ω is normal to H , hence H is a
surface of constant Ω. This completes the proof.

k ∧ m ∧ dΩ = −

8.8.2 The Zeroth Law for Circular Spacetimes
We consider the same situation as in Appendix 8.8.1. The strategy for proving that
κ is constant on a Killing horizon will be similar to the one we used in proving the
constancy of Ω|H .

Mathematical Appendix on Black Holes

513

We extend the definition of the surface gravity κ outside the horizon in a natural
manner by (see (8.292))
1
κ 2 = − dl, dl.
4
Since k and m are commuting Killing fields, we have

(8.349)

Lk dl, dl = 2Lk dl, dl = 2dLk l, dl = 0,
and Lm dl, dl = 0. Therefore the gradient ∇κ is in E ⊥ . Below we show that it is
on H also in E, so ∇κ has to be proportional to l. This implies that κ on H is a
constant.
Once we have established that
m ∧ l ∧ dκ|H = 0,

(8.350)

we are done. To show this we start from the following consequence of the two
Frobenius conditions (8.70)
m ∧ l ∧ dl = 0,

(8.351)

which holds everywhere. Taking the interior product with l gives
0 = l, ml ∧ dl − m ∧ il (l ∧ dl).
On this we apply d ◦ iZ for any vector field Z and obtain




0 = d l, miZ (l ∧ dl) − d Z, mil (l ∧ dl)
+ dm ∧ iZ il (l ∧ dl) − m ∧ diZ il (l ∧ dl).
In the next step we show that when this equation is restricted to H the first three
terms vanish. For the first term this is clear, since both factors in the parenthesis
vanish on H . (Recall that the twist of l vanishes on H .) Obviously the third term
is also zero on H . To show this for the second term we have to consider (N :=
l, l)
dil (l ∧ dl) = d(N dl + l ∧ dN) = 2 dN ∧ dl,
which vanishes on H since dN is proportional to l and l ∧ dl|H = 0. So we arrive
at
m ∧ diZ il (l ∧ dl) = 0 on H.
As above, we have
iZ il (l ∧ dl) = iZ (N dl + l ∧ dN)
= N iZ dl + Z, l dN − l ∧ iZ dN.

(8.352)

514

8 Black Holes

So the factor of m in (8.352) is equal to
dN ∧ iZ dl + N diZ dl + (diZ l) ∧ dN − dl ∧ iZ dN + l ∧ diZ dN
= N diZ dl − iZ (dN ∧ dl) + dZ, l ∧ dN + l ∧ d(iZ dN ).
In (8.352) we need the restriction of this to H . The first two terms in the last expression obviously vanish there, and in the third term we can replace dN by −2κl. So
(8.352) becomes
m ∧ dZ, l ∧ (−2κl) + l ∧ d(iZ dN ) = 0 on H.

(8.353)

Is it allowed to replace dN in the last expression also by −2κl, in spite of the exterior
differentiation? The answer is yes, as the following simple argument shows. After
multiplication with (−2κ) the last term in the square bracket of (8.353) has the
form dN ∧ df for a function f . If we again use adapted coordinates, with N one
of them, and {x i } parameterizing H , we have df = d̄f + ∂N f dN , where d̄f =
∂i f dx i is the differential in H . So dN ∧ df = dN ∧ d̄f on H , showing that on
H dN ∧ df = dN ∧ dg for two functions f and g that agree on H . Therefore, on
H


l ∧ d(iZ dN) = l ∧ d −2κZ, l ,
and (8.353) becomes
Z, lm ∧ l ∧ dκ = 0.
Since the vector field Z is arbitrary, we arrive at (8.350).
Let us summarize: On a Killing horizon, whose outer domain of communication is circular, the surface gravity is constant. This is the zeroth law for circular
spacetimes.
Note that this is a purely geometrical fact. We have never used the field equations
and no assumptions on the matter content had to be made. The proof of the zeroth
law for static spacetimes is left as an exercise.
Exercise 8.6 Prove the zeroth law for a Killing horizon, whose outer domain of
communication is static.
Hints For a static spacetime with Killing field K, we have K ∧ dK = 0. Apply on
this d ◦ iZ ◦ iK and restrict the result to the Killing horizon to conclude that K and
∇κ are proportional.

8.8.3 Geodesic Null Congruences
Congruences of timelike geodesics of a Lorentz manifold have been studied in
Sect. 3.1. In this appendix we investigate the behaviour of (infinitesimal) light

Mathematical Appendix on Black Holes

beams. We shall introduce the “optical scalars” and derive their propagation equations. This material is indispensable for proving the area law. Some of it will also be
used in the proof of the positive energy theorem for black holes (see Chap. 9). Null
congruences also play an important role in the proofs of singularity theorems.
Consider a light beam with wave vector field k = γ̇ . Let γ (λ) be a central null
geodesic, and consider a one-parameter family of neighbouring null geodesics of
the beam, i.e., a variation of γ in the sense of DG, Sect. 16.4, with deviation vector
field X along γ . As shown in DG, Sect. 16.4, X satisfies the Jacobi equation
Ẍ + R(X, k)k = 0,

(8.354)

where a dot denotes the covariant derivative ∇k in the direction k. Note that
 (8.354)
.. 
k, X = k, ∇k2 X = 0,
because of the symmetry properties of the Riemann tensor. So k, X is a linear
function of λ. Note also that along γ (λ) fields of the form (aλ + b)γ̇ (λ), with
a, b constants, are Jacobi fields. Subtracting such a tangent field changes the scalar
products of X with timelike vector fields (e.g. velocity fields), but leaves the scalar
product with k unchanged. In the eikonal limit deviation vectors which connect rays
contained in the same phase hypersurface satisfy
k, X = 0.

(8.355)

This property holds for the equivalence class of deviation vectors that differ from X
by multiples of k. As in the timelike case (Sect. 3.1), the deviation vectors of such
a class simply correspond to different parametrisations of neighbouring geodesics.
For null congruences the scalar product of two deviation vectors obviously depends
only on their equivalence classes. This simple fact is physically important (e.g. in
gravitational lensing). In what follows we shall assume that (8.355) holds.

8.8.4 Optical Scalars
We choose a four-velocity field u along the central ray γ , which is parallel along
γ and satisfies u, u = −1. Furthermore, we normalize the affine parameter λ such
that k, u = −1.
Let us now introduce the following basis along γ : EA , for A = 1, 2, is an orthonormal basis of the plane orthogonal to the span of k and u, which is parallel
along γ . We also use the complex vector ε = E1 + iE2 and its conjugate complex
ε̄ = E1 − iE2 . The following scalar products are obvious,
k, k = k, EA  = u, EA  = k, ε = u, ε = E1 , E2  = ε, ε = 0,
1
−k, u = −u, u = EA , EA  = ε̄, ε = 1.
2

(8.356)

516

Let us also take
E0 = u,

E3 = k − u.

(8.357)

Then {E0 , . . . , E3 } form an orthonormal vierbein along γ .
Next, we introduce the optical scalars θ , σ and ω defined by
1
σ = ε, ∇ε k,

θ = Re ρ,

ω = Im ρ,

(8.358)

where

ρ̄ = ε, ∇ε̄ k.

(8.359)

ρ = θ + iω.

(8.360)

Thus we have

8.8.5 Transport Equation
The vector field X can be decomposed as
X = ξ1 E1 + ξ2 E2 + ξ̃ k.

(8.361)

(A priori we can write X = (ξ1 E1 + ξ2 E2 ) + (ξ0 E0 + ξ3 E3 ), but X, k = 0 implies
ξ0 = ξ3 , hence the last term is proportional to k.) Also let
ξ = ξ1 + iξ2 ,

X = (ξ ε̄ + ξ̄ ε) + term proportional to k.

Note that by (8.356)

hence, recalling that k and X commute,
ξ̇ = ε, ∇k X = ρ̄ξ + σ ξ̄ ,
where we used that ∇k X = ∇X k = 12 ξ ∇ε̄ k + 12 ξ̄ ∇ε k + 0. The resulting transport
equation

8.8.6 The Sachs Equations
We now give a very simple (possibly novel) derivation of the propagation equations
for the optical scalars. We start by differentiating the transport equation (8.365):
ξ̈ = ρ̇ ∗ ξ + ρ ∗ ξ̇ + σ̇ ξ ∗ + σ ξ̇ ∗

On the other hand, the Jacobi equation (8.354) gives

Let us split (8.376a) into two equations for the real and imaginary parts. Together
with (8.376b) we get the basic Sachs equations for the propagation of the optical
scalars:
θ̇ + θ 2 − ω2 + |σ |2 = −R,

(8.380a)

σ̇ + 2θ σ = F,

(8.380b)

ω̇ + 2θ ω = 0.

(8.380c)

Of particular importance is (8.380a), also known as the Raychaudhuri equation.
Let us write the Jacobi equation (8.375), i.e.,
ξ̈ = −Rξ − Fξ ∗ ,

(8.381)

ξ̈ + T ξ = 0,

Conceptually, one should regard ξ as a representative of the “equivalence class mod
k” of X (see (8.361)).

8.8.7 Applications
Let us consider some special families of null geodesics that play an important role
in GR, for instance in proofs of singularity theorems.
First, we consider a spacelike two-dimensional surface S in the spacetime (M, g)
and a congruence of null geodesics orthogonal15 to S for some neighbourhood
U ⊂ S. Let k denote the tangent vector field (or the corresponding one-form), and
let {Ei , i = 1, 2} be an orthonormal basis of vector fields of S in U . We choose a
point p ∈ U and the null geodesics γ with γ (0) = p (see Fig. 8.11).—We claim that
for this situation the rotation rate ω vanishes at p, for any p ∈ U .
The proof of this is simple. From the definition one sees that16
ω=

1
E1 , ∇E2 k − E2 , ∇E1 k .

(8.385)

15 Note that the orthogonal complement of T

p S in Tp M is a two-dimensional Minkowski vector
space. Hence it contains two different null directions, an “ingoing” and an “outgoing” one.

16 Similarly, the real part θ of ρ is given by


2ω = ∇E1 E2 , k − ∇E2 E1 , k = [E1 , E2 ], k = 0,
since [E1 , E2 ] ∈ T S (see DG, Appendix C).
If the initial value of ω vanishes, the propagation equation (8.380c) implies that
ω = 0 everywhere. So the two-parameter family sketched in Fig. 8.11 has vanishing
rotation.
Consider next a congruence of null geodesics which is orthogonal to a family
of hypersurfaces, the wave fronts, as in the eikonal approximation of wave optics.
According to the Frobenius theorem, this is locally equivalent to (see DG, (C.24))
k ∧ dk = 0.

(8.386)

In the notation introduced above, we evaluate k ∧ dk on the triple (ε, ε̄, u). Using
the scalar products in (8.356), and the definition of ρ, we get
0 = (k ∧ dk)(ε, ε̄, u) = k, u dk(ε, ε̄) = −dk(ε, ε̄)
= −∇ε k, ε̄ + ∇ε̄ k, ε = 2(ρ − ρ̄).
This shows that ρ is real, hence ω = 0.
For ω = 0 the Raychaudhuri equation (8.380a) for the expansion θ becomes particularly interesting, because the right-hand side of


θ̇ + θ 2 = − R + |σ |2

field equation implies

or, integrating between λ0 and λ,
−1

θ (λ) ≤ θ (λ0 )−1 + (λ − λ0 ) .

(8.391)

So if θ (λ0 ) is negative, θ (λ) will become unboundedly negative in the interval
[λ0 , λ0 − θ (λ0 )−1 ]. This means that the area element between neighbouring curves
of a two-parameter variation as in Fig. 8.11 goes to zero somewhere in this interval
(see Eq. (8.400) below). The point on the null geodesic where this happens is a focal
point (or conjugate point) of S along the null geodesic.
Let us summarize this important conclusion.
Proposition 8.1 Let θ be the expansion rate along a null geodesic whose initial
rotation rate ω vanishes. If the weak (or strong) energy condition for the energymomentum tensor holds, then θ (λ0 ) < 0 implies that θ becomes −∞ at a finite
value of the affine parameter λ in the interval [λ0 , λ0 − θ (λ0 )−1 ], provided the null
geodesic is defined on this interval. This holds, in particular, for any geodesic of
a hypersurface orthogonal congruence of null geodesics, and for a two-parameter
family of null geodesics normal to a two-dimensional spacelike surface.

8.8.8 Change of Area
We come back to the situation sketched in Fig. 8.11. The two-parameter family of
null geodesics defines the one-parameter family of immersions
φλ : U −→ M,



U * p −→ exp λk(p)

for some interval of λ. Let ηλ be the induced volume forms on φλ (U ). We want to
know how these change with increasing λ. As expected, the rate for this is twice the
expansion rate θ :
η̇λ :=

d
φ ∗ ηλ+ε = 2θ ηλ .
dε ε=0 ε

(8.392)

For deriving this we need the fact that k is orthogonal to the family of immersed
submanifolds φλ (U ). This one may call “Gauss’ lemma for null geodesics” (see
Sect. 3.9). To prove it, let σ (t) be a curve in U , and consider the one-parameter subfamily of null geodesics starting on σ (t) : λ −→ F (λ, t) = φλ (σ (t)). The tangential
fields along F belonging to ∂/∂λ and ∂/∂t are

It will be useful to introduce an orthonormal frame {Eα } which is adapted to the
foliation: Ei (i = 1, 2) are tangential to the submanifolds φλ (U ), and EA (A = 0, 3)
are normal to φλ (U ). The dual basis of 1-forms is denoted by {θ α }. Obviously,

ηλ = θ 1 ∧ θ 2

on φλ (U ).

We want to compute

Let Θ = θ 1 ∧ θ 2 , then
η̇λ = Lk Θ = ik dΘ + dik Θ.

(8.394)

The last term vanishes, because k is perpendicular to E1 and E2 :




ik Θ = ik θ 1 θ 2 − θ 1 ik θ 2 = 0.
For the first term on the right of (8.394) we use the first structure equation, giving
(ωαβ denote the connection forms)
dΘ = dθ 1 ∧ θ 2 − θ 1 ∧ dθ 2 = −ω1α ∧ θ α ∧ θ 2 + θ 1 ∧ ω2α ∧ θ α

Hence,

(ik dΘ)(E1 , E2 ) = θ A (k)ω A (Ej ).

(8.395)

On the other hand we have, using the notation εα ≡ Eα , Eα  = ±1,

so
Lk Θ = −k, 2H Θ.

(8.398)

This proves (8.392), since by (8.384) and (8.396)
θ = −k, H .

In particular, if θ ≥ 0 the area of φλ (V ) does not decrease. On the other hand, if θ
were negative somewhere along one of the null geodesics, Proposition 8.1 implies
that one could find a neighbourhood V such that the area of φλ (V ) vanishes at some
finite value of λ (provided that the null geodesic is defined on a sufficiently large
interval). This will play an important role in the next section.

8.8.9 Area Law for Black Holes
If the spacetime (M, g) satisfies certain general conditions (global hyperbolicity and asymptotic predictability17 ) the horizon H is a closed embedded threedimensional C 1− -submanifold18 (see Proposition 6.3.1 in [10]), and is generated
by null geodesics without future endpoints. (Null geodesic generators of null hypersurfaces are introduced in DG, Appendix A. Note that null geodesic through a point
of H is unique, up to rescaling of the affine parameter.) Null geodesic generators
may leave H in the past, but have to go into J − (I + ). Such leaving events are called
caustics of H . At a caustic H is not C 1 and has a cusp-like structure. But once a
null geodesic has joined into H it will never encounter a caustic again, never leave
H and not intersect any other generator. All these properties, established by R.
Penrose in [283], are (partially) proved in a pedagogical manner in [15], Box 34.1.
There is no point to repeat this here.
Based on these properties we now “prove” the area law (the second law) for
black holes. If the horizon were a sufficiently smooth submanifold, the area law
would follow easily. Using the differential geometric tools developed in the previous
Appendix 8.8.3, we could argue as follows.
Consider two Cauchy hypersurfaces Σ and Σ  , with Σ  in the future of Σ , and
let H = H ∩ Σ and H = H ∩ Σ  be the horizons at time Σ , respectively Σ  . We
want to compare the surface areas

 

where ηH , ηH denote the induced volume forms (measures) on H and H . At each
point p ∈ H there is a unique future- and outward-pointing null direction perpendicular to H, and we can choose a vector field l of future directed null vectors. (Show
that this is possible in a smooth fashion.) The null geodesics with these initial conditions, i.e., the family


λ −→ γp (λ) = expp λl(p)
are generators of H without future endpoints. Therefore, they intersect Σ  in unique
points on H , with unique affine parameter τ (p) for each p ∈ H. If we rescale the
null field l as k(p) := τ (p)l(p), then we obtain a injective map
Φ : H −→ H ,
p −→ expp k(p).
17 In [9] the spacetime (M, g) is said to be strongly asymptotically predictable, if in the unphysical

spacetime (M̃, g̃) there is an open region Ṽ containing the closure of M ∩ J − (I + ) in M̃, such
that (Ṽ , g̃) is globally hyperbolic.
18 This means that H is a topological manifold with an atlas whose transition functions are locally

Lipschitz.

526

8 Black Holes

(The map Φ is in general not surjective because new generators may join the horizon.) As in Appendix 8.8.3 we introduce the one-parameter family of immersions
φ : H −→ M,



p −→ expp λk(p)

for λ ∈ [0, 1]. Clearly, Φ = φλ=1 .
From Proposition 8.1 we conclude that the expansion rate θ (or the negative of
the convergence) of the generating family of null geodesics, λ −→ φλ (p), p ∈ H,
cannot be negative, if the weak energy condition of matter holds. (Otherwise focal
points would be formed in the future, violating Penrose’s theorem on the global
structure of horizons (quoted above).) Formula (8.401) then implies that
 
A H ≥ A(H).
Unfortunately, this beautiful argument is based on a smoothness assumption for
the horizon that is generally not satisfied, because of the formation of caustics where
the manifold has a cuspy structure. As was pointed out by several authors, the general validity of the area law is for this reason still an open problem. For discussions
of this delicate issue, that appears somewhat strange from a physical point of view,
we refer to [278] and [279].

The Positive Mass Theorem

We begin by repeating some material treated at various places in earlier chapters.—
In Newtonian gravity theory the total energy of a system can be indefinitely negative.
(For the critical masses of the white dwarfs, discussed in Sect. 7.2, the total energy
becomes −∞.) This is not the case in GR. It is impossible to construct an object out
of ordinary matter, i.e., matter with positive local energy density, whose total energy
(including gravitational contributions) is negative. This is roughly the content of the
positive energy theorem.
If objects with negative mass could exist in GR, they could repel rather than
attract nearby matter. The positive energy theorem implies, for example, that there
cannot exist a regular interior solution of the “anti-Schwarzschild” solution with
negative mass. All this is, of course, only true for the correct sign on the right-hand
side of the Einstein equation. Changing the sign would lead to repulsion. But then
the positive energy theorem would no longer hold, and we could presumably extract
an unlimited amount of energy from a system with negative energy.
With the correct sign (i.e., attraction) this bizarre situation cannot occur in GR.
Physically, the reason is that as a system is compressed to take advantage of the
negative gravitational binding energy, a black hole is eventually formed which has
positive total energy.
In this chapter we will give essentially E. Witten’s proof of the positive energy
theorem [286] which makes crucial use of spinor fields. To be complete, we develop
the necessary tools on spinors in GR in an Appendix to this chapter. It is very remarkable that spinors have turned out to be so useful in simplifying the proof of
an entirely classical property of GR. The first complete proof of the positive energy
theorem was found by R. Schoen and S.T. Yau [110–113] using minimal surface
techniques. Their proof was in detail rather complicated and also quite indirect.
Witten’s proof, on the other hand, is not only relatively simple, but provides also an
explicit positive integral expression for the energy.
Beside its basic importance for GR, the positive energy theorem provides also
a useful tool for proving certain non-existence theorems for solitons and “no-hairtheorems” for black holes.

The Positive Mass Theorem

9.1 Total Energy and Momentum for Isolated Systems
As we discussed earlier, there is no general conservation law for energy and momentum in GR. For isolated systems it is, however, still possible to define the total energy and the total momentum. There are actually two different concepts of
total energy-momentum which can be extracted from an asymptotically flat spacetime. The asymptotic region at null infinity yields the Bondi four-momentum (see
Sect. 6.1), and the other, at spatial infinity, the Arnowitt–Deser–Misner (ADM) fourmomentum (see Sect. 3.7). The corresponding, masses are the Bondi mass and the
ADM mass. We prove here only the non-negativity of the ADM mass. The corresponding proof of the Bondi mass is very similar; see, e.g., [287].
There are a number of different expressions for the ADM 4-momentum, some of
which will be discussed below. For the proof of the positive energy theorem it will
be crucial to have a flux integral representation in terms of a (test) spinor field. But
first, we recall a sufficiently precise formulation of what we mean by asymptotic
flatness at spatial infinity.
Consider a Lorentz manifold (M, g) and a complete oriented 3-dimensional
spacelike hypersurface Σ . We say that Σ is asymptotically flat if the following
is true:
(a) There is a compact set C ⊂ Σ such that Σ \ C is diffeomorphic to the complement of a contractible compact set in R3 . (More generally, Σ \ C could be the
disjoint union of a finite number of such sets.)
(b) Under this diffeomorphism the metric on Σ \ C should be of the form
gij = δij + hij ,

(i, j = 1, 2, 3)

(9.1)

in the standard coordinates of R3 , where hij = O(1/r), ∂k hij = O(1/r 2 ) and
∂l ∂k hij = O(1/r 3 ). Furthermore, the second fundamental form Kij of Σ ⊂ M
should satisfy Kij = O(1/r 2 ) and ∂k Kij = O(1/r 3 ).
As a starting point we use the following asymptotic flux integral representation
for the ADM 4-momentum belonging to Σ, which we justified in Sect. 3.7, Eq.
(3.209):


Pμ = −

the Hodge-dual of θ α ∧ θ β ∧ θ μ :


(9.3)
ηαβμ = ∗ θ α ∧ θ β ∧ θ μ .
The integration is extended over a 2-sphere in Σ \ C “at infinity” and we should
use the tetrad {θ α } such that asymptotically θ i = dx i on Σ for the coordinates
introduced above. Far away we have for nearly Lorentzian coordinates

and (9.7) have already been derived in Sect. 3.7.)
Note that the integrals (9.5) and (9.7) involve only data on Σ . The disadvantage
of these formulas is that they are not manifestly covariant. J. Nester [288] has given
instead a simple covariant expression in terms of spinors which we discuss next.
(We prefer, however, to use 2-component Weyl spinors instead of 4-component Majorana spinors.) Readers who are not familiar with spinors in GR should first read
the Appendix to this chapter, where we introduce all that is needed in what follows.
The others should have a look at our conventions.
The covariant derivative of a fundamental Weyl spinor field φ, transforming as
D (1/2,0) , is given by
∇φ = dφ + ωαβ σ αβ φ,

where ωαβ are the connection forms relative to an orthonormal tetrad {θ α }. More
generally, if ψ denotes a spinor-valued p-form corresponding to the representation
ρ of SL(2, C), the formula for the exterior covariant derivative reads1


(9.9)
∇ψ = dψ + ωαβ ∧ ρ∗ σ αβ ψ,
where ρ∗ denotes the induced representation of the Lie algebra sl(2, C).
1 Because we denoted the exterior covariant derivative of tensor-valued p-forms by D, the notation
Dψ would perhaps be more appropriate.

The Positive Mass Theorem

We shall use repeatedly the following simple fact which can easily be verified: If
φ is a spinor-valued p-form belonging to the representation D (1/2,0) and σ̂ := σ̂μ θ μ ,
then σ̂ ∧ φ is a spinor-valued (p + 1)-form transforming as D (0,1/2) , and we have
(Exercise 9.1)
∇(σ̂ ∧ φ) = −σ̂ ∧ ∇φ.

(9.10)

(The minus sign reflects that σ̂ is a matrix-valued 1-form.)
For a fundamental Weyl spinor φ of type D (1/2,0) we can introduce the 2-form
F = −iφ † σ̂ ∧ ∇φ,

(9.11)

in terms of which we shall be able to express the ADM 4-momentum. For this we
consider spinors φ which become asymptotically constant on Σ: On Σ \ C (identified as above with the complement of a compact contractible set of R3 with its
standard coordinates), we assume that asymptotically
φ = φ (0) + O(1/r),

(9.12)

where φ (0) is a constant spinor. Now we claim that the contraction of Pμ with the
null vector l (0)μ = φ (0)† σ̂ μ φ (0) is given by (G = 1):

where ημαβλ is the Levi-Civita tensor (see (9.3)). The φ (0) -contribution to the integrand in (9.13) is thus equal to
1
ηαβλ ∧ ωαβ l (0)λ .
4
It is now essential that the O(1/r) term φ (1) in (9.12) gives no contribution to the
flux integral at infinity. Indeed, such a piece would come from the following additional term of the integrand in (9.14):

Recalling (9.2), we see that the fully covariant formula (9.13) for the ADM 4momentum belonging to Σ is indeed correct.

9.2 Witten’s Proof of the Positive Energy Theorem
We are now ready to formulate and to prove the
Theorem 9.1 (Positive Mass Theorem) Assume that the spacelike hypersurface Σ
is asymptotically flat in the sense defined above and that the dominant energy condition holds on Σ. Then the total energy-momentum P μ is a future directed timelike or
null vector. Furthermore, P μ = 0 if and only if spacetime is flat in a neighborhood
of Σ.
Proof We prove this theorem first for the case when there are no horizons present.
In a first step we use Stokes’ theorem (see DG, Sect. 14.7) to write

1

lμ P =

and work out the differential of F . Use of (9.10) gives
dF = −i(∇φ)† ∧ σ̂ ∧ ∇φ + iφ † σ̂ ∧ ∇ 2 φ.

(9.21)

The second exterior covariant derivative of φ can be expressed in terms of the curvature forms Ω αβ :
∇ 2 φ = Ωαβ σ αβ φ.

(9.22)

The Positive Mass Theorem

Therefore, the second term in (9.21) involves
1
σ̂ ∧ Ωαβ σ αβ = −θ μ ∧ Ω αβ σ̂μ σα σ̂β .
4
Here we use the identity (generalizing (9.16))
σ̂μ σα σ̂β = iημαβλ σ̂ λ + (gμβ σ̂α − gαβ σ̂μ − gμα σ̂β )

(9.23)

and the first Bianchi identity Ω αβ ∧ θ β = 0, giving
1
i σ̂ ∧ Ωαβ σ αβ = − ηαβλ ∧ Ω αβ σ̂ λ .
4
The second term in (9.21) is thus
1
iφ † σ̂ ∧ ∇ 2 φ = − ηαβλ ∧ Ω αβ l λ ,
4

(9.24)

where l λ is the null vector
l λ = φ † σ̂ λ φ.

(9.25)

Now Einstein’s field equations read in the tetrad formalism (see Sect. 3.6, Eq.
(3.163)):
1
− ηαβλ ∧ Ω αβ = 4π ∗ Tλ
4

(9.26)

Tλ = Tλσ θ σ .

(9.27)

with

For a tetrad which is adapted to Σ we thus have
iφ † σ̂ ∧ ∇ 2 φ|Σ = −4πT0λ l λ VolΣ ,

(9.28)

where VolΣ = − ∗ θ 0 is the volume form of Σ . The dominant energy condition (see
p. 121) implies that the right-hand side of (9.28) is non-negative. (Note that l λ is
past-directed null vector.)
We consider now the first term in (9.21). Setting ∇φ = (∇α φ)θ α we obtain
−i(∇φ)† ∧ σ̂ ∧ ∇φ = −i(∇α φ)† σ̂λ ∇β φθ α ∧ θ λ ∧ θ β .
The restriction of this expression to Σ gives only non-vanishing contributions for
terms with all indices α, λ, β spatial:
−i(∇φ)† ∧ σ̂ ∧ ∇φ|Σ = −(∇a φ)† iεabc σc ∇b φ VolΣ .
Here we use iεabc σc = σa σb − δab 1, giving


−i(∇φ)† ∧ σ̂ ∧ ∇φ|Σ = (∇a φ)† (∇a φ) − (σa ∇a φ)† (σb ∇b φ) VolΣ .

(9.29)

At first sight this looks bad since the last term has the “wrong” sign. We have,
however, some freedom in choosing the spinor field on Σ . In particular, we can try
to get rid of the negative term by imposing the Witten equation:
σ a ∇a φ = 0

(on Σ).

(9.31)

Suppose we could prove that this equation has a solution for any constant asymptotic
value φ (0) , then we would have the following manifestly non-negative expression for
l (0)μ Pμ :

4π
Σ
where nμ denotes the future directed unit normal to Σ . The second term is manifestly non-negative and for the first this is true as a consequence of the dominant
energy condition.
The existence (and uniqueness) of asymptotically constant solutions of the Witten equation (9.31) has been proven in [291] and [292]. Before making some remarks about this problem, we finish the proof of the positive energy theorem. Since
φ (0) is arbitrary, we deduce that l μ Pμ ≥ 0 for any past directed null vector l μ . Hence
Pμ is a future directed timelike or null vector.
To prove the second part of the theorem we assume Pμ = 0. Equation (9.32)
implies then
∇a φ = 0.

(9.33)

Changing the asymptotic value φ (0) , we see that (9.33) must be satisfied for two
linearly independent spinor fields on Σ . Together with (9.22) this implies that
Rαβij σ αβ φ = 0 for both fields, and therefore
Rαβij = 0

(i, j = 1, 2, 3).

But then the dominant energy condition and Einstein’s field equation give
1 ij
8π|Tαβ | ≤ 8πT00 = R ij = 0,
2
and hence we have also Rαβ = 0 on Σ. Taken together, all curvature components
must vanish and thus (M, g) is flat along Σ.

Below we will extend the proof to the case when horizons are present. Before
that, we examine (9.31) a bit more closely.

The Positive Mass Theorem

9.2.1 Remarks on the Witten Equation
First, we rewrite the linear Witten equation in terms of the induced covariant derivative ∇¯ of Σ (belonging to the induced metric). Let {eμ } be the orthonormal moving
frame dual to the adapted basis {θ μ } of 1-forms used above. We have
∇a φ = dφ, ea  + ωij (ea )σ ij φ + 2ω0j (ea )σ 0j φ.
Using (9.6) and the Gauss formula ωij (ea ) = ω̄ij (ea ), where ω̄ij are the connection
forms of Σ belonging to ∇¯ (see Appendix A of DG, (A.3)), we obtain
1
∇a φ = ∇¯ a φ − Kab σ b φ.
2

(9.34)

Witten’s equation (9.31) is thus equivalent to
1
σ a ∇¯ a φ = Kφ,
2

(9.35)

where K = Kaa . Note in particular, that for a maximal hypersurface (K = 0) the
Witten equation reduces to Weyl’s equation σ a ∇¯ a φ = 0.
We do not give here detailed proofs for the existence and uniqueness for (9.31)
or (9.35), supplemented by the requirement that φ is asymptotically constant, but
indicate only the method.
Since the Witten equation is elliptic (σ a ξa = 0 for ξ = 0), one can follow the
usual strategy: First, one proves the existence of a weak solution in a suitable
Sobolev space H s of spinor-valued functions on Σ. Well-known elliptic regularity theorems then guarantee that the weak solution is in all Sobolev spaces H s for
arbitrary large s. Finally, one proves a generalized Sobolev lemma which implies
that the weak solution is automatically C ∞ . The generalized Sobolev lemma rests
on a generalized Sobolev inequality, whose validity has been reduced in [291] to the
classical Sobolev inequality in Rd .

9.2.2 Application
As an application of the positive mass theorem, we give a simple proof of the following important
Theorem 9.2 (Lichnerowicz) A solution of Einstein’s vacuum equations which is
regular, globally stationary and asymptotically flat must be flat.
Proof For such a solution the ADM mass is given by the vanishing integral (5.227).
Hence, spacetime is flat.

9.3 Generalization to Black Holes
The positive mass theorem for black holes was proven in [293]. Here, we give a
slightly different derivation, using again 2-component spinors.
First we rewrite F |Σ with the help of Witten’s equation, which will again be
imposed. For our adapted frame the Nester 2-form (9.11) reduces to
F |Σ = iφ † σa ∇b φθ a ∧ θ b = φ † iεabc σa ∇b φ dAc
= φ † ∇a φ dAa ,

(9.36)

where dAa := ∗¯ θ a and ∗¯ the Hodge-dual in Σ relative to the induced metric. Using
(9.34) this becomes


1
†¯
† b
F |Σ = φ ∇a φ − Kab φ σ φ dAa .
(9.37)
2
Let us restrict this to a 2-surface S ⊂ Σ which later will become the “future apparent
horizon” (see Fig. 9.1).
We choose the dual pair {θ μ }, {eμ } of adapted frames such that e1 is perpendicular to S and eA , for A = 2, 3, are parallel to S. (Indices with capital letters will
always run over 2 and 3.) From (9.37) we obtain


1
F |S = φ † ∇¯ 1 φ − K1a φ † σ a φ VolS .
(9.38)
2
We can find a useful expression for ∇¯ 1 φ if we multiply Witten’s equation in the
form (9.35) by σ1 :
1
∇¯ 1 φ = −σ1 σA ∇¯ A φ + Kσ1 φ.
2

(9.39)
=

Next we express ∇¯ A |S by the induced covariant derivative ∇ A on S and the second
fundamental form JAB of S in Σ . Using the formula for the Riemannian case which
corresponds to (9.6) we get
=

1
∇¯ A φ =∇ A φ + 2ω̄1B (eA )σ 1B φ =∇ A φ + JAB σ 1 σ B φ.

The Positive Mass Theorem

In (9.39) we need
=

1
−σ1 σA ∇¯ A φ = −σ1 σA ∇ A φ + J φ,
2
where J = JAA . Taken together, (9.38) becomes

1 
F |S = φ † J + (−K11 + K)σ1 − 2σ1 σA DA φ VolS ,
2

(9.41)

where
=
1
DA =∇ A − K1A σ1 .
(9.42)
2
Now, let S be the (outer) future apparent horizon H . This is a compact, spacelike
two-dimensional submanifold on which the expansion θ of the outgoing family of
orthogonal future-directed null geodesics vanishes. (Such families and their optical
scalars are discussed in Appendix 8.8.3.) One can show that the apparent horizon
lies always inside the event horizon or coincides with it (as for the Schwarzschild
black hole).
Translating the boundary condition of [293], we impose

σ1 φ = φ

(on H ).

(9.43)

Since O := σ1 σA DA in (9.41) anticommutes with σ1 , this term gives no contribution. In fact, on H we have—on account of the boundary condition (9.43)—
φ † Oφ = φ † Oσ1 φ = −φ † σ1 Oφ = −φ † Oφ.
We are thus left with

1 
F |H = φ † K − K11 + J φ.
(9.44)
2
We will show below that the expansion θ of the outgoing null congruence on S is
given by

1 
θ = √ −K + K11 − J ,
(9.45)
2
and thus (9.44) vanishes.
This settles the positive energy theorem for black holes, because when we use
Stokes’ theorem to transform the surface integral (9.13) at infinity into an integral
over Σ with the inner boundary H , we do not pick up an additional contribution
from the apparent horizon. Of course, one has to show that the Witten equation
has always a solution for a given asymptotic value φ (0) , which satisfies also the
boundary condition (9.43) on H . In [293] it is made plausible that such solutions
indeed exist, but we are not aware of a rigorous proof.
Finally, we derive (9.45). Consider the two null fields
1
k = √ (e0 + e1 ),

l = √ (e0 − e1 )

9.4 Penrose Inequality
The Penrose inequality, formulated below, can be regarded as a sharpening of the
positive energy theorem for black holes.
For motivation, consider a Schwarzschild black hole. Its mass (the ADM mass
for a spacelike hypersurface Σ = {t = const}) determines the area A(H) of the
intersection of the horizon H with Σ according to A(H) = 4π(2GM)2 . Thus

(9.46)

It is natural to guess that for more general situations the right-hand side of (9.46)
will be a lower limit for the ADM mass. This was originally conjectured by R. Penrose [294], and has relatively recently been proven by G. Huisken and T. Ilmanen
[295] under conditions we now discuss.
Assume that the asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface Σ is maximal. Gauss’
equation in the form (A.21) in DG, Appendix A, together with Einstein’s field equation and the weak energy condition (8.389) show that the Riemann scalar R̄Σ for
the induced metric on Σ is non-negative:
R̄Σ ≥ 0.

(9.47)

Let H be the intersection of Σ with the apparent horizon of a black hole. From
(9.45) we obtain on H (where θ = 0): J = K11 . Hence, if Σ is totally geodesic in
the sense of Definition A.1 in DG, Appendix A, we see that H is a minimal surface
of Σ (the mean curvature vanishes). These considerations lead to the assumptions
of the following
Theorem 9.3 (of Huisken and Ilmanen) Let (Σ, g) be a complete asymptotically
flat Riemannian three-manifold diffeomorphic to R3 minus an open three-ball, with

Remarks
1. For a proof (and a slightly more general formulation) see [295]. Because of (9.46)
the inequality (9.48) is optimal.
2. The quoted theorem (“Riemann Penrose inequality”) covers only the case when
Σ is totally geodesic, in other words, when the initial data on Σ are time symmetric. A general proof of the Penrose inequality is still lacking.

The Positive Mass Theorem

There are two types of fundamental representations of SL(2, C) in terms of which
all other non-trivial finite dimensional irreducible representations can be constructed
(using tensor products and symmetrizations). The (fundamental) spinor representation, denoted by D (1/2,0) is simply L −→ L, while the cospinor representation
D (0,1/2) is defined by L −→ (L† )−1 . Two-component spinors ξ , transforming with
L are called right-handed, whereas two-component spinors η, transforming with
(L† )−1 are called left-handed.
Let V be the space of right-handed spinors ξ = (ξ A ). We then have for ξ ∈ V
L : ξ −→ Lξ,

B
L : ξ A −→ LA
Bξ .

Since det L = 1, the following symplectic form on V

with

(9.60)

is invariant under SL(2, C). This means that LT εL = ε.
It will turn out to be useful to introduce the following operation on 2 × 2 complex
matrices A:
A −→ Â = ε Āε −1 ,

(9.61)

where Ā denotes the complex conjugate matrix. From the previous remark it follows
 −1
L̂ = L†

(9.62)

for L ∈ SL(2, C). The cospinor representation is thus L −→ L̂.

ξA := ξ B εBA .
The inverse of this is
ξ A = ε AB ξB ,

 AB 

(9.63)

(9.64)

Clearly, ξ A ξA is invariant under SL(2, C) for ξ, ξ  ∈ V .
Let V̇ be the space of 2-component left-handed spinors. Following van der Waerden, we denote the components of η ∈ V̇ with lower dotted indices ηȦ . Obviously,

The inverse is, as for right-handed spinors,
ηȦ = ηḂ εḂ Ȧ ,

The representations L −→ L̂ and L −→ L̄ are, of course, equivalent.



x = x AḂ .

(9.71)

Thus, a vector x μ can be regarded as a spinor x AḂ . Equation (9.71) tells us that the
matrix elements of σμ should be written as σμ = (σμAḂ ). The relation between x μ
and x AḂ is then given by
x AḂ = x μ σμAḂ .

(9.72)

Lowering the indices in this equation or in (9.71) can be expressed as
(xAḂ ) = (x̂)T .

particular, we need a covariant derivative of spinor fields. To this end we introduce
some basic concepts.

Given a representation ρ of SL(2, C) in a vector space F we can introduce the
vector bundle E(F, SL(2, C)) which is associated to P̃ (M, SL(2, C)) and has typical fibre F .
Definition 9.2 A Weyl spinor of type ρ over (M, g) is a section in the associated
bundle πE : E −→ M, i.e., a map φ : M −→ E such that πE ◦ φ = idM .
We do not assume in what follows that the reader is familiar with associated
bundles, because we shall use an equivalent definition of Weyl spinors, which makes
only use of the principle bundle π̃ : P̃ −→ M. A Weyl spinor can also be viewed as
a map φ̃ : P̃ −→ F which satisfies the following covariance condition


φ̃(p · g) = ρ g −1 φ̃(p)
(9.84)
for each p ∈ P̃ and g ∈ G.

The Levi-Civita connection form ω on P (M, L+ ) induces a 1-form ω̃ on P̃ with
values in the Lie algebra sl(2, C) by
 ∗ 
ω̃ = λ−1
(9.85)
∗ πs ω ,
where λ∗ : sl(2, C) −→ so(1, 3) is the Lie algebra isomorphism belonging to λ. It is
a good exercise to verify that ω̃ is a connection form on the spin bundle P̃ . With it
we can now define in the usual fashion a covariant derivative of Weyl spinor fields
by
∇ φ̃ := (d φ̃)hor ,
where ‘hor’ denotes the horizontal component belonging to ω̃. Explicitly, one has
always
∇ φ̃ = d φ̃ + ρ∗ (ω̃)φ̃.

(9.86)

More generally, if φ̃ is a spinor-valued ‘horizontal’ p-form, the (exterior) covariant
derivative is given by
∇ φ̃ = d φ̃ + ρ∗ (ω̃) ∧ φ̃.

(9.93)

A bar denotes complex conjugation, and ημν is the flat metric diag(−1, 1, 1, 1).
Note that ωαβ in (9.91) and (9.92) are just the Levi-Civita connection forms relative to the tetrad {θ μ }.
Not every Lorentz manifold has a spin structure. We quote the following famous
Theorem 9.4 A space or time orientable pseudo-Riemannian manifold has a spin
structure if and only if its second Stiefel–Whitney class vanishes.
R.P. Geroch (see [290]) has proven the following
Theorem 9.5 A space and time orientable open (non-compact) Lorentz manifold
has a spin structure if and only if the manifold is parallelizable.
Spinors and spinor analysis in GR are treated very extensively in [136] and [289].

Essentials of Friedmann–Lemaître Models

10.1 Introduction
GR plays a central role in the grand domain of cosmology. Much of the conceptual framework of modern cosmology was developed during the decades after the
creation of GR until about the time of Einstein’s death. In recent times cosmology has truly become a natural science, mainly thanks to spectacular progress on
the observational front. There is now a strong interplay between observations and
theory, which converged to a well established description of the universe. Some of
the discoveries are also of great interest to fundamental physics: There is strong
evidence for the existence of additional particles outside the standard model of particle physics—so-called dark matter—and for an exotic nearly homogeneous dark
energy with strongly negative pressure (p ≈ −ρ). The simplest candidate for this
unknown energy density is a cosmological term in Einstein’s field equations, a possibility that has been considered during all the history of relativistic cosmology.
Independently of what this exotic energy density is, one thing is certain since a long
time: The energy density belonging to the cosmological constant is not larger than
the cosmological critical density, and thus incredibly small by particle physics standards. This is a profound mystery, since we expect that all sorts of vacuum energies
contribute to the effective cosmological constant. For instance, from quantum fluctuations in known fields up to the electroweak scale, contributions are expected to
be more than 50 orders of magnitude larger than the observed dark energy density.
Space does not allow us to give an adequate introduction to the vast field of
modern cosmology. (For this I refer to the recent cosmology textbooks cited in the
bibliography.) This chapter contains only a concise treatment of the Friedmann–
Lemaître models, together with some crucial observations which can be described
within this idealized class of cosmological models. (A direct continuation of this
chapter on more advanced topics can also be found in [127] and [296].)
It is most remarkable that the simple, highly-symmetric cosmological models,
that were developed in the 1920’s by Friedmann and Lemaître, still play such an
important role in modern cosmology. After all, they were not put forward on the
basis of astronomical observations. When the first paper by Friedmann appeared

Essentials of Friedmann–Lemaître Models

in 1922 (in Z.f.Physik) astronomers had only knowledge of the Milky Way. In particular, the observed velocities of stars were all small. Remember, astronomers only
learned later that spiral nebulae are independent star systems outside the Milky Way.
This was definitely established when in 1924 Hubble found that there were Cepheid
variables in Andromeda and also in other nearby galaxies.
Friedmann’s models were based on mathematical simplicity, as he explicitly
states. This was already the case with Einstein’s static model of 1917, in which
space is a metric 3-sphere. About this Einstein wrote to de Sitter that his cosmological model was intended primarily to settle the question “whether the basic idea
of relativity can be followed through its completion, or whether it leads to contradictions”. And he adds whether the model corresponds to reality was another matter. Friedmann writes in his dynamical generalization of Einstein’s model about the
metric ansatz, that this can not be justified on the basis of physical or philosophical
arguments.
Friedmann’s two papers from 1922 and 1924 have a strongly mathematical character. It was too early to apply them to the real universe. In his second paper he
treated the models with negative spatial curvature. Interestingly, he emphasizes that
space can nevertheless be compact, an aspect that has only recently come again into
the focus of attention.—It is really sad that Friedmann died already in 1925, at the
age of 37. His papers were largely ignored throughout the 1920’s, although Einstein studied them carefully and even wrote a paper about them. He was, however,
convinced at the time that Friedmann’s models had no physical significance.
The same happened with Lemaître’s independent work of 1927. Lemaître was
the first person who seriously proposed an expanding universe as a model of the real
universe. He derived the general redshift formula, and showed that it leads for small
distances to a linear relation, known as Hubble’s law. He also estimated the Hubble
constant H0 based on Slipher’s redshift data for about 40 nebulae and Hubble’s
1925 distance determinations to Andromeda and some other nearby galaxies, as
well as the magnitudes of nebulae published by him in 1926. Two years before
Hubble he found a value only somewhat higher than the one Hubble obtained in
1929. (Actually, Lemaître gave two values for H0 .)
The general attitude is well illustrated by the following remark of Eddington at a
Royal Society meeting in January, 1930: “One puzzling question is why there should
be only two solutions. I suppose the trouble is that people look for static solutions.”
Lemaître, who had been for a short time in 1925 a post-doctoral student of Eddington, read this remark in a report to the meeting published in Observatory, and
wrote to Eddington pointing out his 1927 paper. Eddington had seen that paper, but
had completely forgotten about it. But now he was greatly impressed and recommended Lemaître’s work in a letter to Nature. He also arranged for a translation
which appeared in MNRAS.
To a minority of cosmologists who had read the French original, it was known
that a few paragraphs were deleted in the translation, notably the one in which
Lemaître assessed the evidence for linearity of the distance-velocity relation and
estimated the expansion rate. Fortunately, the origin of this curious fact has finally
been completely cleared up [298]. It was Lemaître himself who translated his original paper. The correspondence of him with the editor of MNRAS, quoted in [298],

10.2

shows that Lemaître was not very interested in establishing priority. He saw no point
in repeating in 1931 his findings four years earlier, since the quality of the observational data had in the meantime been improved.
Hubble, on the other hand, nowhere in his famous 1929 paper even mentions an
expanding universe, but interprets his data within the static interpretation of the de
Sitter solution (repeating what Eddington wrote in the second edition of his relativity
book in 1924). In addition, Hubble never claimed to have discovered the expanding
universe, he apparently never believed this interpretation. That Hubble was elevated
to the discoverer of the expanding universe belongs to sociology, public relations,
and rewriting history.
The following remark is also of some interest. It is true that the instability of
Einstein’s model is not explicitly stated in Lemaître’s 1927 paper, but this was an
immediate consequence of his equations. In the words of Eddington: “. . . it was immediately deducible from his [Lemaître’s] formulae that Einstein’s world is unstable
so that an expanding or a contracting universe is an inevitable result of Einstein’s
law of gravitation.”
Lemaître’s successful explanation of Slipher’s and Hubble’s improved data, carefully analyzed by de Sitter in a series of papers, finally changed the viewpoint of the
majority of workers in the field. For an excellent, carefully researched book on the
early history of cosmology, see [297].

10.2 Friedmann–Lemaître Spacetimes
There is now good evidence that the (recent as well as the early) Universe1 is—on
large scales—surprisingly homogeneous and isotropic. The most impressive support for this comes from extended redshift surveys of galaxies and from the truly
remarkable isotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In the Two Degree Field (2dF) Galaxy Redshift Survey,2 completed in 2003, the redshifts of about
250,000 galaxies have been measured. The distribution of galaxies out to 4 billion
light years shows that there are huge clusters, long filaments, and empty voids measuring over 100 million light years across. But the map also shows that there are
no larger structures. The more extended Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has produced very similar results, and measured spectra of about a million galaxies.3
One arrives at the Friedmann (–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker) spacetimes by postulating that for each observer, moving along an integral curve of a distinguished
1 By Universe I always mean that part of the world around us which is in principle accessible to observations. In my opinion the ‘Universe as a whole’ is not a scientific concept. When talking about
model universes, we develop on paper or with the help of computers, I tend to use lower case letters. In this domain we are, of course, free to make extrapolations and venture into speculations, but
one should always be aware that there is the danger to be drifted into a kind of ‘cosmo-mythology’.

Essentials of Friedmann–Lemaître Models

four-velocity field u, the Universe looks spatially isotropic. Mathematically, this
means the following: Let Isox (M) be the group of local isometries of a Lorentz
manifold (M, g), with fixed point x ∈ M, and let SO3 (ux ) be the group of all linear
transformations of the tangent space Tx (M) which leave the 4-velocity ux invariant and induce special orthogonal transformations in the subspace orthogonal to ux ,
then


Tx φ : φ ∈ Isox (M), φ$ u = u ⊇ SO3 (ux )
(φ$ denotes the push-forward belonging to φ). In [299] it is shown that this requirement implies that (M, g) is a Friedmann spacetime, whose structure we now recall.
Note that (M, g) is then automatically homogeneous.
A Friedmann spacetime (M, g) is a warped product of the form M = I × Σ ,
where I is an interval of R, and the metric g is of the form
g = −dt 2 + a 2 (t)γ ,

(10.1)

such that (Σ, γ ) is a Riemannian space of constant curvature k = 0, ±1. The distinguished time t is the cosmic time, and a(t) is the scale factor (it plays the role of
the warp factor (see Appendix B of DG)). Instead of t we often use the conformal
time η, defined by dη = dt/a(t). The velocity field is perpendicular to the slices of
constant cosmic time, u = ∂/∂t.

10.2.1 Spaces of Constant Curvature
For the space (Σ, γ ) of constant curvature4 the curvature is given by
R (3) (X, Y )Z = k γ (Z, Y )X − γ (Z, X)Y ;

(10.2)

in components:
(3)

Rij kl = k(γik γj l − γil γj k ).

(10.3)

Hence, the Ricci tensor and the scalar curvature are
(3)

Rj l = 2kγj l ,

R (3) = 6k.

(10.4)

For the curvature two-forms we obtain from (10.3) relative to an orthonormal
triad {θ i }
1 (3)
(3)
Ωij = Rij kl θ k ∧ θ l = kθi ∧ θj
2

(10.5)

(θi = γik θ k ). The simply connected constant curvature spaces are in n dimensions
the (n+1)-sphere S n+1 (k = 1), the Euclidean space (k = 0), and the pseudo-sphere
4 For a detailed discussion of these spaces I refer—for readers knowing German—to [300] or [302].

10.2

(k = −1). Non-simply connected constant curvature spaces are obtained from these
by forming quotients with respect to discrete isometry groups. (For detailed derivations, see [300].)

10.2.2 Curvature of Friedmann Spacetimes
Let {θ̄ i } be any orthonormal triad on (Σ, γ ). On this Riemannian space the first
structure equations read (quantities referring to this 3-dim. space are indicated by
bars)
d θ̄ i + ω̄i j ∧ θ̄ j = 0.

(10.6)

On (M, g) we introduce the following orthonormal tetrad:
θ 0 = dt,

θ i = a(t)θ̄ i .

(10.7)

ȧ
dθ i = θ 0 ∧ θ i − a ω̄i j ∧ θ̄ j .
a

(10.8)

From this and (10.6) we get
dθ 0 = 0,

Comparing this with the first structure equation for the Friedmann manifold implies
ω0 i ∧ θ i = 0,

ȧ
ωi 0 ∧ θ 0 + ωi j ∧ θ j = θ i ∧ θ 0 + a ω̄i j ∧ θ̄ j ,
a

(10.9)

whence
ȧ
ω0 i = θ i ,
a

ωi j = ω̄i j .

(10.10)

The worldlines of comoving observers are integral curves of the four-velocity
field u = ∂t . We claim that these are geodesics, i.e., that
∇u u = 0.

(10.11)

To show this (and for other purposes) we introduce the basis {eμ } of vector fields
dual to (10.7). Since u = e0 we have, using the connection forms (10.10),
∇u u = ∇e0 e0 = ωλ 0 (e0 )eλ = ωi 0 (e0 )ei = 0.

10.2.3 Einstein Equations for Friedmann Spacetimes

(For an independent derivation, see DG, Appendix B.)
In order to satisfy the field equations, the symmetries of Gμν imply that the
energy-momentum tensor must have the perfect fluid form (see Sect. 2.4.2):
T μν = (ρ + p)uμ uν + pg μν ,

(10.16)

where u is the comoving velocity field introduced above.

(10.18)

Although the ‘energy-momentum conservation’ does not provide an independent
equation, it is useful to work this out. As expected, the momentum ‘conservation’ is
automatically satisfied. For the ‘energy conservation’ we use the general form (see
(2.37))
∇u ρ = −(ρ + p)∇ · u.

(10.19)

In our case we have for the expansion rate
∇ · u = ωλ 0 (eλ )u0 = ωi 0 (ei ),
thus with (10.10)
ȧ
∇ ·u=3 .

(10.20)

(10.21)

Therefore, Eq. (10.19) becomes

This should not be considered, as it is often done, as an energy conservation law.
Because of the equivalence principle there is in GR no local energy conservation.
(For more on this see Sect. 10.3.3.)

10.2

For a given equation of state, p = p(ρ), we can use (10.21) in the form
d  3
ρa = −3pa 2
da

(10.22)

to determine ρ as a function of the scale factor a. Examples: 1. For free massless
particles (radiation) we have p = ρ/3, thus ρ ∝ a −4 . 2. For dust (p = 0) we get
ρ ∝ a −3 .
With this knowledge the Friedmann equation (10.17) determines the time evolution of a(t). It is easy to see that (10.18) follows from (10.17) and (10.21).
As an important consequence of (10.17) and (10.18) we obtain for the acceleration of the expansion
ä = −

4πG
(ρ + 3p)a + Λa.

(10.23)

This shows that as long as ρ + 3p is positive, the first term in (10.23) is decelerating,
while a positive cosmological constant is repulsive. This becomes understandable if
one writes the field equation as

This vacuum contribution has the form of the energy-momentum tensor of an ideal
fluid, with energy density ρΛ = Λ/8πG and pressure pΛ = −ρΛ . Hence the combination ρΛ + 3pΛ is equal to −2ρΛ , and is thus negative. In what follows we shall
often include in ρ and p the vacuum pieces.

10.2.4 Redshift
As a result of the expansion of the Universe the light of distant sources appears
redshifted. The amount of redshift can be simply expressed in terms of the scale
factor a(t).
Consider two integral curves of the average velocity field u. We imagine that one
describes the worldline of a distant comoving source and the other that of an observer at a telescope (see Fig. 10.1). Since light is propagating along null geodesics,
we conclude from (10.1) that along the worldline of a light ray dt = a(t) dσ , where
dσ is the line element on the 3-dimensional space (Σ, γ ) of constant curvature
k = 0, ±1. Hence the integral on the left of

that this also follows from the differential equation for null geodesics.

10.2.5 Cosmic Distance Measures
We now introduce a further important tool, namely operational definitions of three
different distance measures, and show that they are related by simple redshift factors.
If D is the physical (proper) extension of a distant object, and δ is its angle
subtended, then the angular diameter distance DA is defined by
DA := D/δ.

(10.31)

If the object is moving with the proper transversal velocity V⊥ and with an apparent
angular motion dδ/dt0 , then the proper-motion distance is by definition
DM :=

V⊥
.
dδ/dt0

(10.32)

Finally, if the object has the intrinsic luminosity L and F is the received energy flux
then the luminosity distance is naturally defined as
DL := (L/4πF)1/2 .

(10.33)

Below we show that these three distances are related as follows
DL = (1 + z)DM = (1 + z)2 DA .

(10.34)

It will be useful to introduce on (Σ, γ ) ‘polar’ coordinates (r, ϑ, ϕ) (obtained by
stereographic projection), such that
γ=

dr 2
+ r 2 dΩ 2 ,
1 − kr 2

dΩ 2 = dϑ 2 + sin2 ϑ dϕ 2 .

(10.35)

One easily verifies that the curvature forms of this metric satisfy (10.5). (This follows without doing any work by using the curvature forms (4.9) for the ansatz (4.3)
of the Schwarzschild metric.)
To prove (10.34) we show that the three distances can be expressed as follows, if
re denotes the comoving radial coordinate (in (10.35)) of the distant object and the
observer is (without loss of generality) at r = 0:
DA = re a(te ),

DM = re a(t0 ),

DL = re a(t0 )

a(t0 )
.
a(te )

(10.36)

Once this is established, (10.34) follows from (10.30).
From Fig. 10.2 and (10.35) we see that
D = a(te )re δ,
hence the first equation in (10.36) holds.

(10.37)

556

To prove the second one we note that the source moves in a time dt0 a proper
transversal distance

dD = V⊥ dte = V⊥ dt0

Using again the metric (10.35) we see that the apparent angular motion is

a(te )re
a(t0 )re

Inserting this into the definition (10.32) shows that the second equation in (10.36)
holds. For the third equation we have to consider the observed energy flux. In a time
dte the source emits an energy L dte . This energy is redshifted to the present by a
factor a(te )/a(t0 ), and is now distributed by (10.35) over a sphere with proper area
4π(re a(t0 ))2 (see Fig. 10.2). Hence the received flux (apparent luminosity) is
F = L dte

a(te )

,
2
a(t0 ) 4π(re a(t0 )) dt0

thus
F=

La 2 (te )

4πa 4 (t0 )re2

Inserting this into the definition (10.33) establishes the third equation in (10.36). For
later applications we write the last equation in the more transparent form
F=

L
.

4π(re a(t0 )) (1 + z)2

The last factor is due to redshift effects.
Two of the discussed distances as a function of z are shown in Fig. 10.3 for two
Friedmann models with different cosmological parameters. The other two distance
measures will not be used in this chapter.

10.3 Thermal History Below 100 MeV
10.3.1 Overview
Below the transition at about 200 MeV from a quark-gluon plasma to the confinement phase, the Universe was initially dominated by a complicated dense hadron
soup. The abundance of pions, for example, was so high that they nearly overlapped. The pions, kaons and other hadrons soon began to decay and most of the
nucleons and antinucleons annihilated, leaving only a tiny baryon asymmetry. The
energy density is then almost completely dominated by radiation and the stable leptons (e± , the three neutrino flavors and their antiparticles). For some time all these
particles are in thermodynamic equilibrium. For this reason, only a few initial conditions have to be imposed. The Universe was never as simple as in this lepton era.
(At this stage it is almost inconceivable that the complex world around us would
eventually emerge.)
The first particles which freeze out of this equilibrium are the weakly interacting
neutrinos. Let us estimate when this happened. The coupling of the neutrinos in the
lepton era is dominated by the reactions:
e− + e+ ↔ ν + ν̄,

e± + ν → e± + ν,

e± + ν̄ → e± + ν̄.

For dimensional reasons, the cross sections are all of magnitude
σ ≃ G2F T 2 ,

(10.39)

where GF is the Fermi coupling constant ( = c = kB = 1). Numerically, GF m2p ≃
10−5 . On the other hand, the electron and neutrino densities ne , nν are about T 3 .
For this reason, the reaction rates Γ for ν-scattering and ν-production per electron

(10.41)

and thus

This ratio is larger than 1 for T > 1010 K ≃ 1 MeV, and the neutrinos thus remain
in thermodynamic equilibrium until the temperature has decreased to about 1 MeV.
But even below this temperature the neutrinos remain Fermi distributed,
nν (p) dp =

1
1
p 2 dp,
p/T
2

(10.42)

as long as they can be treated as massless. The reason is that the number density
decreases as a −3 and the momenta with a −1 . Because of this we also see that the
neutrino temperature Tν decreases after decoupling as a −1 . The same is, of course,
true for photons. The reader will easily find out how the distribution evolves when
neutrino masses are taken into account. (Since neutrino masses are so small this is
only relevant at very late times.)

10.3.2 Chemical Potentials of the Leptons
The equilibrium reactions below 100 MeV, say, conserve several additive quantum
numbers,5 namely the electric charge Q, the baryon number B, and the three lepton numbers Le , Lμ , Lτ . Correspondingly, there are five independent chemical potentials. Since particles and antiparticles can annihilate to photons, their chemical
potentials are oppositely equal: μe− = −μe+ , etc. From the following reactions
e− + μ+ → νe + ν̄μ ,

e− + p → νe + n,

μ− + p → νμ + n

we infer the equilibrium conditions
μe − − μν e = μμ − − μν μ = μn − μp .

10.3

Thermal History Below 100 MeV

559

As independent chemical potentials we can thus choose
μp , μe − , μν e , μν μ , μν τ .

(10.44)

Because of local electric charge neutrality, the charge number density nQ vanishes. From observations (see the next section) we also know that the baryon number
density nB is much smaller than the photon number density (∼entropy density sγ ).
The ratio nB /sγ remains constant for adiabatic expansion (both decrease with a −3 ;
see the next section). Moreover, the lepton number densities are
nLe = ne− + nνe − ne+ − nν̄e ,

nLμ = nμ− + nνμ − nμ+ − nν̄μ ,

etc. (10.45)

Since in the present Universe the number density of electrons is equal to that of
the protons (bound or free), we know that after the disappearance of the muons
ne− ≃ ne+ (recall nB  nγ ), thus μe− (= −μe+ ) ≃ 0. It is conceivable that the
chemical potentials of the neutrinos and antineutrinos can not be neglected, i.e., that
nLe is not much smaller than the photon number density. In analogy to what we
know about the baryon density we make the reasonable assumption that the lepton
number densities are also much smaller than sγ . Then we can take the chemical
potentials of the neutrinos equal to zero (|μν |/kT  1). With what we said before,
we can then put the five chemical potentials (10.44) equal to zero, because the charge
number densities are all odd in them. Of course, nB does not really vanish (otherwise
we would not be here), but for the thermal history in the era we are considering they
can be ignored.

10.3.3 Constancy of Entropy
Let ρeq , peq denote (in this subsection only) the total energy density and pressure
of all particles in thermodynamic equilibrium. Since the chemical potentials of the
leptons vanish, these quantities are only functions of the temperature T . According
to the second law, the differential of the entropy S(V , T ) is given by
dS(V , T ) =



d ρeq (T )V + peq (T ) dV .

If we use this in (10.46), we get


dS = d
T


so the entropy density of the particles in equilibrium is
s=

1
ρeq (T ) + peq (T ) .
T

(10.48)

For an adiabatic expansion the entropy in a comoving volume remains constant:
S = a 3 s = const.

(10.49)

This constancy is equivalent to the energy equation (10.21) for the equilibrium part.
Indeed, the latter can be written as
a3

dpeq
d 3
=
a (ρeq + peq ) ,
dt
dt

and by (10.48) this is equivalent to dS/dt = 0.
In particular, we obtain for massless particles (p = ρ/3) from (10.47) again
ρ ∝ T 4 and from (10.48) that S = constant implies T ∝ a −1 .
It is sometimes said that for a Friedmann model the expansion always proceeds
adiabatically, because the symmetries forbid a heat current to flow into a comoving volume. While there is indeed no heat current, entropy can be generated if the
cosmic fluid has a non-vanishing bulk viscosity. This follows formally from general
relativistic thermodynamics. Equation (B.36) in Appendix B of [301] shows that the
divergence of the entropy current contains the term (ζ /T )θ 2 , where ζ is the bulk
viscosity and θ the expansion rate (= 3(ȧ/a) for a Friedmann spacetime).
Once the electrons and positrons have annihilated below T ∼ me , the equilibrium components consist of photons, electrons, protons and—after the big bang
nucleosynthesis—of some light nuclei (mostly He4 ). Since the charged particle
number densities are much smaller than the photon number density, the photon temperature Tγ still decreases as a −1 . Let us show this formally. For this we consider
beside the photons an ideal gas in thermodynamic equilibrium with the black body
radiation. The total pressure and energy density are then (we use again units with
 = c = kB = 1; n is the number density of the non-relativistic gas particles with
mass m):

For σ  1 this gives the well-known relation T ∝ a 3(γ −1) for an adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas.
We are however dealing with the opposite situation σ  1, and then we obtain,
as expected, a · T = const.
Let us look more closely at the famous ratio nB /sγ . We need

we obtain as a measure for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe



It is one of the great challenges to explain this tiny number. So far, this has been
achieved at best qualitatively in the framework of grand unified theories (GUTs).

10.3.4 Neutrino Temperature
During the electron-positron annihilation below T = me the a-dependence is complicated, since the electrons can no more be treated as massless. We want to know at
this point what the ratio Tγ /Tν is after the annihilation. This can easily be obtained
by using the constancy of comoving entropy for the photon-electron-positron system, which is sufficiently strongly coupled to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium.
We need the entropy for the electrons and positrons at T  me , long before
annihilation begins. To compute this note the identity

10.3.5 Epoch of Matter-Radiation Equality
The epoch when radiation (photons and neutrinos) have about the same energy density as non-relativistic matter (dark matter and baryons) plays a very important role
for the properties of the microwave background and structure formation. Let us determine the redshift, zeq , when there is equality.
For the three neutrino and antineutrino flavors the energy density is according to

Only a small fraction of ΩM is baryonic. There are several methods to determine
the fraction ΩB in baryons. A traditional one comes from the abundances of the light
elements. This is treated in most texts on cosmology. (German speaking readers find
a detailed discussion in my lecture notes [302], which are available in the internet.)
The comparison of the straightforward theory with observation gives a value in the
range ΩB h20 = 0.021 ± 0.002. Other determinations are all compatible with this
value. The striking agreement of different methods, sensitive to different physics,
strongly supports our standard big bang picture of the Universe.

10.3.6 Recombination and Decoupling
The plasma era ends when electrons combine with protons and helium ions to form
neutral atoms. The details of the physics of recombination are a bit complicated,
but for a rough estimate of the recombination time one can assume thermodynamic
equilibrium conditions. (When the ionization fraction becomes low, a kinetic treatment is needed.) For simplicity, we ignore helium and study the thermodynamic
equilibrium of e− + p  H + γ . The condition for chemical equilibrium is
μ e − + μp = μH ,

(10.62)

where μi (i = e− , p, H ) are the chemical potentials of e− , p and neutral hydrogen H . These are related to the particle number densities as follows: For electrons

where Q is the partition sum of the internal degrees of freedom

(εn is measured from the ground state). Usually only the ground state is taken into
account, Q ≃ 4.
For hydrogen, the partition sum of an isolated atom is obviously infinite, as a
result of the long-range of the Coulomb potential. However, in a plasma the latter is
screened, and for our temperature and density range the ground state approximation
is very good (estimate the Debye length and compare it with the Bohr radius for the
principle quantum number n). Then we obtain the Saha equation:

where Δ is the ionization energy Δ = 12 α 2 me ≃ 13.6 eV. (In the last factor we have
replaced mp /mH by unity.)
Let us rewrite this in terms of the ionization fraction xe := ne /nB , nB = np +
nH = ne + nH :

(10.68)

So, when the temperature is of order Δ, the right-hand side is of order 109 (me /
T )3/2 ∼ 1015 . Hence xe is very close to 1. Recombination only occurs when T
drops far below Δ. Using (10.56) we see that xe = 1/2 for


Trec

exp (−13.6 eV/Trec ) = 1.3 · 10−6 ΩB h20 .

For ΩB h20 ≃ 0.02 this gives
Trec ≃ 3760 K = 0.32 eV,

zrec ≃ 1380.

Decoupling occurs roughly when the Thomson scattering rate is comparable to
the expansion rate. The first is ne σT = xe mp nB σT /mp = xe σT ΩB ρcrit /mp . For H
we use Eqs. (10.91) and (10.92) below: H (z) = H0 E(z), where for large redshifts
1/2
E(z) ≃ ΩM (1 + z)3/2 [1 + (1 + z)/(1 + zeq )]1/2 . So we get

For best-fit values of the cosmological parameters the right-hand side is for z ≃ 1000
about 102 xe . Hence photons decouple when xe drops below ∼ 10−2 .
Kinetic Treatment For an accurate kinetic treatment one has to take into account
some complications connected with the population of the 1s state and the Ly-α
background. We shall add later some remarks on this, but for the moment we are
satisfied with a simplified treatment.
We replace the photon number density nγ by the equilibrium distribution of temperature T . If σrec denotes the recombination cross section of e− + p → H + γ , the
electron number density satisfies the rate equation

10.4.1 Theoretical Redshift-Luminosity Relation
In cosmology several different distance measures are in use, which are all related by
simple redshift factors (see Sect. 10.2.5). The one which is relevant in this section
is the luminosity distance DL . We recall that this is defined by
DL = (L/4πF)1/2 ,

(10.78)

where L is the intrinsic luminosity of the source and F the observed energy flux.
We want to express this in terms of the redshift z of the source and some of the
cosmological parameters. If the comoving radial coordinate r is chosen such that
the Friedmann–Lemaître metric takes the form

a(t0 )/a(te ), we find in a first step:


DL (z) = a0 (1 + z)r(z) a0 ≡ a(t0 ) .

ΩM and ΩΛ are kept as independent parameters, where from now on the subscript
M denotes (as in most papers) non-relativistic matter.
The following remark about degeneracy curves in the Ω-plane is important in
this context. For a fixed z in the presently explored interval, the contours defined by
the equations DL (z; ΩM , ΩΛ ) = const have little curvature, and thus we can associate an approximate slope to them. For z = 0.4 the slope is about 1 and increases
to 1.5–2 by z = 0.8 over the interesting range of ΩM and ΩΛ . Hence even quite
accurate data can at best select a strip in the Ω-plane, with a slope in the range just
discussed.
In this context it is also interesting to determine the dependence of the deceleration parameter

The line q0 = 0 (ΩΛ = ΩM /2) separates decelerating from accelerating universes
at the present time. For given values of ΩM , ΩΛ , etc., (10.104) vanishes for z determined by
ΩM (1 + z)3 − 2ΩΛ + · · · = 0.

This equation gives the redshift at which the deceleration period ends (coasting
redshift).
Remark Without using the Friedmann equation one can express the luminosity distance DL (z) purely kinematically in terms of the deceleration variable q(z). With
the help of the previous tools the reader may derive the following relations for a

Essentials of Friedmann–Lemaître Models

Generalization for Dynamical Models of Dark Energy
If the vacuum energy constitutes the missing two thirds of the average energy density of the present Universe, we would be confronted with the following cosmic
coincidence problem: Since the vacuum energy density is constant in time—at least
after the QCD phase transition—while the matter energy density decreases as the
Universe expands, it would be more than surprising if the two are comparable just
at about the present time, while their ratio was tiny in the early Universe and would
become very large in the distant future. The goal of dynamical models of Dark
Energy is to avoid such an extreme fine-tuning. The ratio p/ρ of this component
then becomes a function of redshift, which we denote by wQ (z) (because so-called
quintessence models are particular examples). Then the function E(z) in (10.92)
gets modified.
To see how, we start from the energy equation (10.84) and write this as
d ln(ρQ a 3 )
= 3wQ .
d ln(1 + z)
This gives

As indicated above, a much discussed class of dynamical models for Dark Energy
are quintessence models. In many ways people thereby repeat what has been done
in inflationary cosmology. The main motivation there was to avoid excessive fine
tunings of standard big bang cosmology (horizon and flatness problems). It has to
be emphasize, however, that quintessence models do not solve the vacuum energy
problem, so far also not the coincidence puzzle.

10.4.2 Type Ia Supernovae as Standard Candles
It has long been recognized that supernovas of type Ia are excellent standard candles
and are visible to cosmic distances [304] (the record is at present at a redshift of
about 1.7). At relatively close distances they can be used to measure the Hubble

constant, by calibrating the absolute magnitude of nearby supernovas with various
distance determinations (e.g., Cepheids).
In 1979 Tammann [305] and Colgate [306] independently suggested that at
higher redshifts this subclass of supernovas can be used to determine also the deceleration parameter. This program became feasible thanks to the development of
new technologies which made it possible to obtain digital images of faint objects
over sizable angular scales, and by making use the Hubble Space Telescope and big
ground-based instruments.
Two major teams, the ‘Supernova Cosmology Project’ (SCP) and the ‘High-Z
Supernova search Team’ (HZT). found a large number of SNe Ia, and both groups
have published in the late 1990’s almost identical results. (For information, see the
home pages [307] and [308].) These data gave strong evidence that the expansion
of the Universe is accelerating. Due to systematic uncertainties many astronomers
were hesitant to accept this dramatic conclusion. In the meantime the combined
efforts of several teams provided an impressive increase in both the total number of
SNe Ia and the quality of individual measurements.
Before discussing the most recent results, a few remarks about the nature and
properties of type Ia SNe should be made. Observationally, they are characterized
by the absence of hydrogen in their spectra, and the presence of some strong silicon
lines near maximum. The immediate progenitors are most probably carbon-oxygen
white dwarfs in close binary systems, but it must be said that these have not yet been
clearly identified.7
In the standard scenario a white dwarf accretes matter from a nondegenerate companion until it approaches the critical Chandrasekhar mass and ignites carbon burning deep in its interior of highly degenerate matter. This is followed by an outwardpropagating nuclear flame leading to a total disruption of the white dwarf. Within a
few seconds the star is converted largely into nickel and iron. The dispersed nickel
radioactively decays to cobalt and then to iron in a few hundred days. A lot of effort has been invested to simulate these complicated processes. Clearly, the physics
of thermonuclear runaway burning in degenerate matter is complex. In particular,
since the thermonuclear combustion is highly turbulent, multidimensional simulations are required. This is an important subject of current research. (One gets a good
impression of the present status from several articles in [309]. See also the review
[310].) The theoretical uncertainties are such that, for instance, predictions for possible evolutionary changes are not reliable.
It is conceivable that in some cases a type Ia supernova is the result of a merging of two carbon-oxygen-rich white dwarfs with a combined mass surpassing the
Chandrasekhar limit. No significant X-ray emission is expected in this merger scenario until shortly before the supernova, while accreting white dwarfs become for

stars.

some time (∼ 107 years) sources of X-rays. This issue is still debated, both theoretically and observationally.8
In view of the complex physics involved, it is not astonishing that type Ia supernovas are not perfect standard candles. Their peak absolute magnitudes have a
dispersion of 0.3–0.5 mag, depending on the sample. Astronomers have, however,
learned in recent years to reduce this dispersion by making use of empirical correlations between the absolute peak luminosity and light curve shapes. Examination
of nearby SNe Ia showed that the peak brightness is correlated with the time scale
of their brightening and fading: slow decliners tend to be brighter than rapid ones.
There are also some correlations with spectral properties. Using these correlations it
became possible to reduce the remaining intrinsic dispersion, at least in the average,
to ≃ 0.15 mag. Other corrections, such as Galactic extinction, have been applied,
resulting for each supernova in a corrected (rest-frame) magnitude. The redshift
dependence of this quantity is compared with the theoretical expectation given by
(10.101) and (10.99). Depending on which light curve fitter is used people have
arrived at different results.
Possible systematic uncertainties due to astrophysical effects have been discussed
extensively in the literature. Among the most serious ones are (i) galactic and intergalactic extinction, and (ii) evolution of SNe Ia over cosmic time, due to changes in
progenitor mass, metallicity, and C/O ratio. It has not yet been convincingly demonstrated that evolutionary effects are under sufficient control, given the precision of
current data sets. Evolution may affect the relationships between luminosity and
color and luminosity versus light curve shape. Much larger data sets are needed to
settle such issues.

10.4.3 Results
After the classic papers [312–314] on the Hubble diagram for high-redshift type Ia
supernovas, published by the SCP and HZT teams, significant progress has been
made. Since the data are continuously improving, we show here only some main
results of one of the most recent (at the time of writing) studies [315]. The Hubble
diagram for the so called Union2.1 compilation is shown in Fig. 10.4.
Figure 10.5 shows the confidence regions in the (ΩM , ΩΛ ) plane for the SN results, together with other constraints (explained, for instance, in [127]). A flat concordance ΛCDM model is an excellent fit. The confidence regions in the (ΩM , w)
plane are presented in Fig. 10.6. Obviously, a value for the equation of state parameter w close to −1 is favored. A possible evolution of w is, so far, only weakly
constraint. For further discussions, in particular for the estimates of systematic uncertainties, we refer to [315].
8 Recently it has convincingly been demonstrated that the supernova remnant SNR 0509-67.5 (the
site of a type Ia supernova 400 ± 50 years ago) in the Large Magellanic Cloud originated from
such an event. See [311].

Part III

Differential Geometry

In this purely mathematical part, we develop the most important concepts and results
of differential geometry which are needed for general relativity theory.
The presentation differs little from that in many contemporary mathematical text
books. The language of modern differential geometry and the “intrinsic” calculus
on manifolds are now frequently used by workers in the field of general relativity and are beginning to appear in textbooks on the subject. This has a number of
advantages, such as:
(a) It enables one to read the mathematical literature and make use of the results to
attack physical problems.
(b) The fundamental concepts, such as differentiable manifolds, tensor fields, affine
connection, and so on, adopt a clear and intrinsic formulation.
(c) Physical statements and conceptual problems are not confused by the dependence on the choice of coordinates. At the same time, the role of distinguished
coordinates in the physical applications is clarified. For example, these can be
adapted to symmetry properties of the system.
(d) The exterior calculus of differential forms is a very powerful method for practical calculations; one often finds the results faster than with older methods.
Space does not allow us to always give complete proofs and sufficient motivation. In those cases, we give detailed references to the literature (see (Thirring in

Details and Supplements” the reader can find some of the proofs not given in the
main body of the text. Many readers will have the requisite mathematical knowledge to skip this part after familiarizing themselves with our notation (which is
quite standard). This is best done by looking at the collection of important formulas
in Appendix D. Readers who have no previous knowledge in differential geometry
should first study all of Chaps. 11 and 12 and then go directly to Chap. 15, and
absorb Sects. 15.1–15.6. These contain the most important tools for GR and form a
self-contained part. Other sections may be studied when they are needed.

Chapter 11

Differentiable Manifolds

A manifold is a topological space which locally looks like the space Rn with the
usual topology.
Definition 11.1 An n-dimensional topological manifold M is a topological Hausdorff space with a countable base, which is locally homeomorphic to Rn . This means
that for every point p ∈ M there is an open neighborhood U of p and a homeomorphism
h : U −→ U 
which maps U onto an open set U  ⊂ Rn .
As an aside, we note that a topological manifold M also has the following properties:
(a) M is σ -compact;
(b) M is paracompact and the number of connected components is at most denumerable.
The second of these properties is particularly important for the theory of integration.
For a proof, see e.g. [43], Chap. II, Sect. 15.
Definition 11.2 If M is a topological manifold and h : U −→ U  is a homeomorphism which maps an open subset U ⊂ M onto an open subset U  ⊂ Rn , then h is
a chart of M and U is called the domain of the chart or local coordinate neighborhood (Fig. 11.1). The coordinates (x 1 , . . . , x n ) of the image h(p) ∈ Rn of a point
p ∈ U are called the coordinates of p #
in the chart. A set of charts {hα |α ∈ I } with
domains Uα is called an atlas of M, if α∈I Uα = M.
If hα and hβ are two charts, then both define homeomorphisms on the intersection of their domains Uαβ := Uα ∩ Uβ ; one thus obtains a homeomorphism hαβ

Fig. 11.2 Change of

between two open sets in Rn (Fig. 11.2) via the commutative diagram:

Thus hαβ = hβ ◦ h−1
α on the domain where the mapping is defined. This mapping
gives a relation between the coordinates in the two charts and is called a change of
coordinates or coordinate transformation (see Fig. 11.2).
Sometimes, particularly in the case of charts, it is useful to include the domain
of a mapping in the notation; thus, we write (h, U ) for the mapping h : U −→ U  .
Definition 11.3 An atlas defined on a manifold is said to be differentiable if all of
its coordinate changes are differentiable mappings.
For simplicity, unless otherwise stated, we shall always mean differentiable mappings of class C ∞ on Rn (the derivatives of all orders exist and are continuous).
Obviously, for all coordinate transformations one has (on the domains for which the
mappings are defined) hαα = Id and hβγ ◦ hαβ = hαγ , so that h−1
αβ = hβα , and hence
the inverses of the coordinate transformations are also differentiable. They are thus
diffeomorphisms.

11

Differentiable Manifolds

581

If A is a differentiable atlas defined on manifold M, then D(A) denotes the atlas that contains exactly those charts for which each coordinate change with every
chart of A is differentiable. The atlas D(A) is then also differentiable since, locally,
a coordinate change hβγ in D(A) can be written as a composition hβγ = hαγ ◦ hβα
of two other coordinate changes with a chart hα ∈ A, and differentiability is a local
property. The atlas D(A) is clearly the largest differentiable atlas that contains A.
Thus, every differentiable atlas A determines uniquely a maximal differentiable atlas D(A) such that A ⊂ D(A). Furthermore, D(A) = D(B) if and only if the atlas
A ∪ B is differentiable (exercise). In this case one says that A and B are equivalent.
Equivalence of differentiable atlases is thus an equivalence relation.
Definition 11.4 A differentiable structure on a topological manifold is a maximal
differentiable atlas. A differentiable manifold is a topological manifold, together
with a differentiable structure.
In order to define a differentiable structure on a manifold, one must specify a
differentiable atlas. In general, one specifies as small an atlas as possible, rather
than a maximal one, which is then obtained as described above. We shall tacitly
consider only charts and atlases of a manifold having a differentiable structure D
that are contained in D. (These are sometimes called admissible.)
As a shorthand notation, we write M, rather than (M, D) to denote a differentiable manifold.
Examples
1. M = Rn . The atlas is formed by the single chart (Rn , Id).
2. Any open subset of a differentiable manifold has an obvious differentiable structure. It may have others as well.
Definition 11.5 A continuous mapping φ : M −→ N from one differentiable manifold to another is said to be differentiable at the point p ∈ M if for some (and
hence for every) pair of charts h : U −→ U  of M and k : V −→ V  of N with
p ∈ U and φ(p) ∈ V , the composite mapping k ◦ φ ◦ h−1 in Fig. 11.3 is differentiable at the point h(p) ∈ U  . Note that this mapping is defined in the neighborhood
h(φ −1 (V ) ∩ U ) of h(p). The mapping φ is differentiable if it is differentiable at
every point p ∈ M. One can regard k ◦ φ ◦ h−1 as a coordinate representation of φ
in the charts h and k; for such a representation, the concept of differentiability is
clear.
The identity and the composites of differentiable mappings are differentiable.
Hence differentiable manifolds form a category. Let C ∞ (M, N ) be the set of differentiable mappings from M to N . We write
F(M) = C ∞ (M) := C ∞ (M, R).
Definition 11.6 A bijective differentiable mapping φ, whose inverse φ −1 is also
differentiable is called a diffeomorphism.

Fig. 11.4 Immersion

Every chart h : U −→ U  of M is a diffeomorphism between U and U  , provided U  is taken to have the standard differentiable structure as an open set in Rn .
Differential topology is the study of properties which remain invariant under diffeomorphisms.
It is a nontrivial question as to whether two different differentiable structures
can be introduced on a given topological manifold in such a way that the resulting
differentiable manifolds are not diffeomorphic. For example, it was shown by M.
Kervaire and J. Milnor that the topological 7-sphere has exactly 15 different structures which are not mutually diffeomorphic. Recently it has been shown that even
R4 has more than one, actually infinitely many differentiable structures.
Definition 11.7 A differentiable mapping φ : M −→ N is called an immersion if
(with the notation of Definition 11.5) the charts h : U −→ U  ⊂ Rm and k : V −→
V  ⊂ Rn can be chosen such that k ◦ φ ◦ h−1 : h(U ) −→ k(V ) is the inclusion, when
we regard Rm as Rm × {0} ⊂ Rn (it is assumed that m < n). In other words, the local
coordinate representation of φ is given by (x 1 , . . . , x m ) −→ (x 1 , . . . , x m , 0, . . . , 0).
(See also Fig. 11.4.)

Remarks
1. An immersion is locally injective, but not necessarily globally injective.

11

Differentiable Manifolds

583

Fig. 11.5 Submanifold

2. If φ : M −→ N is an injective immersion, the mapping φ : M −→ φ(M) ⊂ N ,
where φ(M) has the induced topology, is not necessarily a homeomorphism. If,
in addition, φ is in fact a homeomorphism, then φ is called an embedding.
Definition 11.8 If M and N are differentiable manifolds, then M is said to be a
submanifold of N provided that
(i) M ⊂ N (as sets).
(ii) The inclusion ι : M '→ N is an embedding.
The reader is cautioned that the concepts of embedding and submanifold are not
defined in a unified manner in the literature. For example, what we call a submanifold is sometimes called a proper or regular submanifold.
Since the inclusion ι of Definition 11.8 is an immersion, one can, according to
Definition 11.7, choose charts h : U −→ U  ⊂ Rm and k : V −→ V  ⊂ Rn whose
domains are neighborhoods of the point p ∈ M ⊂ N such that locally ι has the
representation ι : (x 1 , . . . , x m ) −→ (x 1 , . . . , x m , 0, . . . , 0). Since M has the induced
topology (ι is an embedding, hence also a homeomorphism), it follows that U has
the form U = Ṽ ∩ M, where Ṽ is an open neighborhood of p in N . If we restrict
the chart k to the domain W := Ṽ ∩ V then we see that
W ∩ M = {q ∈ W |k(q) ∈ Rm × {0} ⊂ Rn }.
One describes this situation by saying that the submanifold M lies locally in N as
Rm does in Rn . (See Fig. 11.5.)
Let M m and N n be two differentiable manifolds. We can define a product manifold by taking the underlying topological space to be the Cartesian product of
the two topological spaces. The differentiable structure is defined as follows: if
h : U −→ U  and k : V −→ V  are charts of M and N , then
h × k : U × V −→ U  × V  ⊂ Rm × Rn = Rm+n
is a chart of M × N and the set of all charts defines the differentiable structure of
M × N.

584

11

Differentiable Manifolds

Remarks The (standard) Definition 11.4 of a differentiable manifold starts with a
topological space. One can alternatively begin with a set and introduce the topology
with a given atlas. This approach is not only practical to construct differentiable
manifolds, but is also more appropriate from a physical point of view. In detail this
is done as follows.
Let M be an abstract set (for instance the set of elementary space-time events).
For each i ∈ I (index set) let hi be a bijection from a subset Ui ⊂ M onto an open
set hi (Ui ) in Rn , satisfying:
(a) The domains {Ui : i ∈ I } cover M.
(b) For all i, j ∈ I the set hi (Ui ∩ Uj ) is open and the map hj ◦ h−1
i is smooth on
this domain of Rn .
(c) For two different points p and q in M, either p and q are in a single Ui or there
are i, j ∈ I such that p ∈ Ui , q ∈ Uj , with Ui and Uj disjoint.
One can then show (see [46], p. 23) that there is a unique Hausdorff topology and
a complete (maximal) differentiable atlas on M such that each (Ui , hi ) is a chart of
the resulting manifold. Furthermore, if countable many Ui cover M then M has a
countable base (is second countable).

Chapter 12

Tangent Vectors, Vector and Tensor Fields

At every point p of a differentiable manifold M, one can introduce a linear space,
called the tangent space Tp (M). A tensor field is a (smooth) map which assigns to
each point p ∈ M a tensor of a given type on Tp (M).

12.1 The Tangent Space
Before defining the tangent space, let us introduce some basic concepts. Consider
two differentiable manifolds M and N , and the set of differentiable mappings {φ |
φ : U −→ N for a neighborhood U of p ∈ M}. Two such mappings φ, ψ are called
equivalent, φ ∼ ψ , if and only if there is a neighborhood V of p such that φ|V =
ψ|V . Here φ|V denotes the restriction of φ to the domain V . In other words, φ and
ψ are equivalent if they coincide on some neighborhood V of p.
Definition 12.1 An equivalence class of this relation is called a germ of smooth
mappings M −→ N at the point p ∈ M. A germ with representative φ is denoted
by
φ̄ : (M, p) −→ N

or

φ̄ : (M, p) −→ (N, q) if q = φ(p).

Compositions of germs are defined naturally via their representatives. A germ
of a function is a germ (M, p) −→ R. The set of all germs of functions at a point
p ∈ M is denoted by F(p).
The set F(p) has the structure of a real algebra, provided the operations are
defined using representatives. A differentiable germ φ̄ : (M, p) −→ (N, q) defines,
through composition, the following homomorphism of algebras:
φ ∗ : F(q) −→ F(p),
f¯ −→ f¯ ◦ φ̄.

(We omit the bar symbol on φ in φ ∗ .) Obviously
Id∗ = Id,

(ψ ◦ φ)∗ = φ ∗ ◦ ψ ∗ .

(12.2)

If φ̄ is a germ having an inverse φ̄ −1 , then φ ∗ ◦ (φ −1 )∗ = Id and φ ∗ is thus an
isomorphism.
For every point p ∈ M of a n-dimensional differentiable manifold, a chart h
having a neighborhood of p as its domain defines an invertible germ h̄ : (M, p) −→
(Rn , 0) and hence an isomorphism
h∗ : Fn −→ F(p),
where Fn is the set of germs (Rn , 0) −→ R.
We now give three equivalent definitions of the tangent space at a point p ∈ M.
One should be able to switch freely among these definitions. The “algebraic definition” is particularly handy.
Definition 12.2 (Algebraic definition of the tangent space) The tangent space
Tp (M) of a differentiable manifold M at a point p is the set of derivations of F(p).
A derivation of F(p) is a linear mapping X : F(p) −→ R which satisfies the Leibniz rule (product rule)
X(f¯ḡ) = X(f¯)ḡ(p) + f¯(p)X(ḡ).

(12.3)

A differentiable germ φ̄ : (M, p) −→ (N, q) (and thus a differentiable mapping
φ : M −→ N ) induces an algebra homomorphism φ ∗ : F(q) −→ F(p) and hence
also a linear mapping
Tp φ̄ : Tp (M) −→ Tq (N ),

(12.4)

X −→ X ◦ φ ∗ .

Definition 12.3 The linear mapping Tp φ̄ is called the differential (or tangent map)
of φ̄ at p.
The set of derivations obviously forms a vector space. The Leibnitz rule gives
X(1) = X(1 · 1) = X(1) + X(1),

i.e. X(1) = 0,

where 1 is the germ defined by the constant function having value unity (we drop
the bar symbol). Linearity then implies that X(c) = 0 for every constant c.
The definition of the differential says in particular that for a given germ f¯ :
(N, q) −→ R
Tp φ̄(X)(f¯) = X ◦ φ ∗ (f¯) = X(f¯ ◦ φ̄),
φ̄

X ∈ Tp (M).
ψ̄

(12.5)

This (or (12.2)), implies for a composition (M, p) −→ (N, q) −→ (L, r) the chain
rule

Tp (ψ̄ ◦ φ̄) = Tq ψ̄ ◦ Tp φ̄

(12.6)

for the differentials.
In practice we will treat tangent vectors as operating on functions, and consider
differentials of maps. For these operations we later drop the bar symbols that indicate the corresponding germs. A pedantic notation would be too cumbersome. For
instance, we write X(f ) for X(f¯). Thus X(f ) = X(g) whenever f and g agree on
a neighborhood of a point p in Definition 12.2. Similarly, for a locally defined map
φ on a neighborhood of p we write Tp φ instead of Tp φ̄.
If h̄ : (N, p) −→ (Rn , 0) is a germ of some chart, then the induced mapping
∗
h : Fn −→ F(p) is an isomorphism. This is then also true for the differential Tp h̄ :
Tp N −→ T0 Rn . In order to describe the latter space we use the
Lemma 12.1 If U is an open ball about the origin of Rn , or Rn itself, and
f : U −→ R is a differentiable function, then there exist differentiable functions
f1 , . . . , fn : U −→ R, such that

Remarks According to what has just been discussed, the tangent spaces of an ndimensional differentiable manifold M also have dimension n. Thus, the dimension
of M is unambiguously defined. This can also be shown to be true for topological
manifolds.
The use of local coordinates (x 1 , . . . , x n ) in a neighborhood of a point p ∈ N n
enables us to write vectors in Tp (N ) explicitly as linear combinations of the ∂/∂x i .
As a result of the isomorphism Tp h : Tp N −→ T0 Rn , we can regard the ∂/∂x i also
as elements of Tp (N ). According to (12.5) we then have for f¯ ∈ F(p)

where f ◦ h−1 denotes the coordinate representation of any representative f of f¯.
If φ̄ : (N n , p) −→ (M m , q) is a differentiable germ and if we introduce local
coordinates (y 1 , . . . , y m ) in a neighborhood of q, then φ̄ can be expressed as a germ
(Rn , 0) −→ (Rm , 0) which we denote for simplicity also by φ̄:

The tangent map T0 φ̄ is obtained as follows: Let f¯ ∈ Fm and set (for a representative φ) φ(x 1 , . . . , x n ) = (φ 1 (x 1 , . . . , x n ), . . . , φ m (x 1 , . . . , x n )). From (12.5) and

is called the Jacobian of the mapping φ.
We can-also express the result (12.7) as follows: if v = i a i ∂/∂x i , then
T0 φ̄(v) = j bj (∂/∂y j ), where
b = Dφ0 · a.

(12.9)

(Dφ0 is the Jacobian at the origin.)
We summarize:
Theorem 12.1 If one introduces local coordinates (x 1 , . . . , x n ) in a neighborhood
of p ∈ N n and (y 1 , . . . , y m ) in a neighborhood of q ∈ M m , then the derivations
∂/∂x i and ∂/∂y i form bases of the vector spaces Tp N and Tq M, respectively. The
tangent mapping of a germ φ̄ : (N, p) −→ (M, q) is given by
Dφ0 : Rn −→ Rm
with respect to these bases.
We now give the “physicist’s definition” of the tangent space which starts from
the preceding result. Briefly, one often says that a contravariant vector is a real ntuple which transforms according to the Jacobian matrix. We now wish to express
this more precisely.
If h̄ and k̄ : (N, p) −→ (Rn , 0) are germs of charts, then the coordinate transformation ḡ = k̄ ◦ h̄−1 : (Rn , 0) −→ (Rn , 0) is an invertible differentiable germ. The set
of all invertible germs of coordinate transformations forms a group G under composition. For two germs h̄ and k̄ there is exactly one ḡ ∈ G such that ḡ ◦ h̄ = k̄. To
each ḡ ∈ G we assign the Jacobian at the origin Dg0 . This defines a homomorphism
G −→ GL(n, R),
ḡ −→ Dg0
between G and the linear group of non-singular n × n matrices. This enables us to
formulate the “physicist’s definition” more precisely.

590

12

Tangent Vectors, Vector and Tensor Fields

Definition 12.4 (Physicist’s definition of the tangent space) A tangent vector at
a point p ∈ N n is an assignment which associates with every germ of a chart h̄ :
(N, p) −→ (Rn , 0), a vector v = (v 1 , . . . , v n ) ∈ Rn such that to the germ ḡ ◦ h̄
corresponds the vector Dg0 · v.
Thus, if we denote by Kp the set of germs of charts h̄ : (N, p) −→ (Rn , 0), the
“physicist’s” tangent space Tp (N )phys is the set of mappings v : Kp −→ Rn for
which v(ḡ ◦ h̄) = Dg0 · v(h̄) for all ḡ ∈ G.
The set of all such mappings forms a vector space, since Dg0 is a linear mapping.
One can choose the vector v ∈ Rn arbitrarily for a given chart h, and the choice for
all other charts is then fixed. The vector space Tp (N )phys is isomorphic to Rn . An
isomorphism is given via the choice of a local coordinate system. The canonical
isomorphism
Tp (N ) −→ Tp (N )phys
with the algebraically defined tangent space (see Definition 12.2) assigns to the
derivation X ∈ Tp (N ) the vector (X(h̄1 ), . . . , X(h̄n )) ∈ Rn for a given germ h̄ =
(h̄1 , . . . , h̄n ) : (N, p) −→ (Rn , 0). The components of this vector are precisely the
coefficients of X with respect to the basis ∂/∂x i . They transform according to the
Jacobian under a change of coordinates.
The “geometric definition” of the tangent space is the most intuitive one. It identifies tangent vectors with “velocity vectors” of curves through the point p at that
point.
Definition 12.5 A curve on N passing through p is given by a differentiable mapping w which maps an open interval I ⊂ R into N with 0 ∈ I and w(0) = p.
Definition 12.6 (Geometric definition of the tangent space) We introduce an equivalence relation on the set Wp of germs of paths through p. We say that w̄ and v̄ in
Wp are equivalent (w̄ ∼ v̄) if and only if for every germ f¯ ∈ F(p)
d
d ¯
(f ◦ w̄)(0) = (f¯ ◦ v̄)(0).
dt
dt
An equivalence class [w] of this relation is a tangent vector at the point p.
Two germs of paths define the same tangent vector if they define the same
“derivative along the curve”. To every equivalence class [w] we can thus associate
a derivation X[w] of F(p) by
X[w] (f¯) :=

d ¯
(f ◦ w̄)(0),
dt

w̄ ∈ [w].

This relation defines the injective mapping
Wp /∼ =: Tp (N )geom −→ Tp (N ),

[w] −→ X[w]

12.1

The Tangent Space

591

of the set of equivalence classes of germs of paths into the tangent space. This
mapping is also surjective, since if w(t) is given in local coordinates by w(t) =
(ta 1 , . . . , ta n ) then X[w] = i a i ∂/∂x i . Obviously X[w] = X[v] in precisely those
cases for which (d/dt)w i (0) = (d/dt)v i (0) for any local coordinate system.
In this geometrical interpretation the tangent map is easily visualized. A germ
φ̄ : (N, p) −→ (M, q) induces the mapping, using representatives,
Tp (N )geom −→ Tp (M)geom ,

[w] −→ [φ ◦ w].

The following equation shows that this definition of the tangent map is consistent
with that in Definition 12.2:
X[φ◦w] (f¯) =


d¯
(12.5)
f ◦ (φ̄ ◦ w̄) (0) = X[w] (f¯ ◦ φ̄) = Tp φ̄(X[w] )(f¯),
dt

thus
X[φ◦w] = Tp φ̄ · X[w] .
In the following, we shall regard the three different definitions of a tangent space
as equivalent and use whichever of them is most convenient. Note, for instance, that
the chain rule follows trivially in the geometrical interpretation.
Definition 12.7 The rank of a differentiable mapping φ : M −→ N at the point
p ∈ M is the number rkp := rank of Tp φ.
Lemma 12.2 The rank of a mapping is lower semicontinuous: if rkp φ = r, there is
a neighborhood U of p such that rkq φ ≥ r for all q ∈ U .
Proof We choose local coordinates and consider the Jacobian Dφ corresponding
to φ in the neighborhood of p ∈ V ⊂ Rm . The elements of this matrix describe a
differentiable mapping V −→ Rm·n such that q −→ ∂φ i /∂x j (q). Since rkp φ = r,
there exists an r × r submatrix of Dφp (without loss of generality, we may take this
to be the first r rows and r columns) which has a non-vanishing determinant at p.
Therefore the mapping
V −→ Rm·n −→ Rr·r
−→
R
q −→ Dq φ −→ submatrix −→ determinant
does not vanish at p, and hence also not in some neighborhood of p. The rank
cannot decrease there.

Usually one defines an immersion as follows:
Definition 12.8 A differentiable mapping φ : M −→ N is called an immersion if
its rank is equal to the dimension of M for all p ∈ M.

Tangent Vectors, Vector and Tensor Fields

One can show that this definition is equivalent to the one given in Chap. 11 (see
Definition 11.7). This follows easily from the inverse function theorem (see, for
example, [43], p. 55).

12.2 Vector Fields
Definition 12.9 If to every point p of a differentiable manifold M a tangent vector
Xp ∈ Tp (M) is assigned, then we call the map X : p −→ Xp a vector field on M.
If (x 1 , . . . , x n ) are local coordinates in an open set U ⊂ M, then for every point
p ∈ U , Xp has a unique representation of the form


∂
Xp = ξ (p)
.
∂x i p
i

(12.10)

Definition 12.10 The n functions ξ i (i = 1, . . . , n) defined on U are the components
of X with respect to the local coordinate system (x 1 , . . . , x n ).
Consider now a second local coordinate system (x̄ 1 , . . . , x̄ n ) on U and let ξ̄ i be
the components of X relative to (x̄ 1 , . . . , x̄ n ), then we have, according to the results
of Sect. 12.1,
∂ x̄ i
(p)ξ j (p), p ∈ U.
(12.11)
∂x j
Hence, the property that the components of X are continuous, or of class C r at a
point p does not depend on the choice of the local coordinate system. If X is continuous or of class C r at every point of M, we say that the vector field is continuous,
or of class C r on M.
In the following, we shall consider only vector fields of class C ∞ (unless stated
otherwise) and denote the set of such fields by X (M). F(M) or C ∞ (M) denote the
class of C ∞ functions on M, as before.
If X, Y ∈ X (M) and f ∈ F(M), the assignments p −→ f (p)Xp and p −→
Xp + Yp define new vector fields on M. These are denoted by f X and X + Y ,
respectively. The following rules apply: If f, g ∈ F(M) and X, Y ∈ X (M), then
ξ̄ i (p) =

f (gX) = (f g)X,
f (X + Y ) = f X + f Y,
(f + g)X = f X + gX.
We also define the functions Xf on M by
(Xf )(p) = Xp f,

p ∈ M.

12.2

Vector Fields

593

In local coordinates, we have
X = ξ i ∂/∂x i ,
where the ξ i are C ∞ functions. Since
(Xf )(p) = ξ i (p)

∂f
(p)
∂x i

it follows that Xf is also a C ∞ function. Xf is called the derivative of f with
respect to the vector field X. The following rules hold:
X(f + g) = Xf + Xg,
X(f g) = (Xf )g + f (Xg)

(Leibniz rule).

In algebraic language, X (M) is a module1 over the associative algebra F(M).
If we set
DX f = Xf

f ∈ F(M), X ∈ X (M),

(12.12)

then DX is a derivation of the algebra F(M). One can prove (see [43], p. 73) that
conversely every derivation of F(M) is of the form DX for some vector field X.
The commutator of two derivations D1 and D2 of an algebra A,
[D1 , D2 ]a := D1 (D2 a) − D2 (D1 a),

a ∈ A,

is also a derivation, as one can easily show by direct computation. The commutator
is antisymmetric
[D1 , D2 ] = −[D2 , D1 ]
and satisfies the Jacobi identity
D1 , [D2 , D3 ] + D2 , [D3 , D1 ] + D3 , [D1 , D2 ] = 0.
As a result, one is led to define the commutator of two vector fields X and Y
according to
[X, Y ]f = X(Yf ) − Y (Xf ).

(12.13)

One can easily prove the following properties:
[X + Y, Z] = [X, Z] + [Y, Z],

X, Y, Z ∈ X (M),

[X, Y ] = −[Y, X],
[f X, gY ] = f g[X, Y ] + f (Xg)Y − g(Yf )X,

f, g ∈ F(M),

(12.14)

X, [Y, Z] + Z, [X, Y ] + Y, [Z, X] = 0.
1 For this basic algebraic concept, and a few other ones assumed to be known, consult any book on
algebra (or groups).

12.3 Tensor Fields
For the following, the reader is assumed to be familiar with some basic material of
multilinear algebra (see [39], Sect. 1.7). In addition to the tangent space Tp (M) at a
point p ∈ M, we shall consider the dual space or cotangent space Tp∗ (M).
Definition 12.11 Let f be a differentiable function defined on an open set U ⊂ M.
If p ∈ U and v ∈ Tp (M) is an arbitrary vector, we set
(df )p (v) := v(f ).

(12.16)

The mapping (df )p : Tp (M) −→ R is obviously linear, and hence (df )p ∈ Tp∗ (M).
The linear function (df )p is the differential of f at the point p.
For a local coordinate system (x 1 , . . . , x n ) in a neighborhood of p, we have

That is, the n-tuple {(dx 1 )p , . . . , (dx n )p } is a basis of Tp∗ (M) which is dual to the
basis {( ∂x∂ 1 )p , . . . , ( ∂x∂ n )p } of Tp (M).
We can write (df )p as a linear combination of the (dx i )p :

Definition 12.12 Let Tp (M)rs be the set of tensors of rank (r, s) defined on Tp (M)
(contravariant of rank r, covariant of rank s). If we assign to every p ∈ M a tensor
tp ∈ Tp (M)rs , then the map t : p −→ tp defines a tensor field of type (r,s).
Algebraic operations on tensor fields are defined pointwise; for example, the sum
of two tensor fields is defined by
(t + s)p = tp + sp ,

t, s ∈ Tp (M)rs .

Tensor products and contractions of tensor fields are defined analogously. A tensor
field can also be multiplied by a function f ∈ F(M):
(f t)p = f (p)tp .
The set Tsr (M) of tensor fields of type (r, s) is thus a module over F(M).
In a coordinate neighborhood U , having coordinates (x 1 , . . . , x n ), a tensor field
can be expanded in the form

A tensor field is of class C r if all its components are of class C r . We see that this
property is independent of the choice of coordinates. If two tensor fields t and s are
of class C r , then so are s + t and s ⊗ t. In the following, we shall only consider C ∞
tensor fields.
Covariant tensors of order 1 are also called one-forms. The set of all one-forms
will be denoted by X ∗ (M). The completely antisymmetric covariant tensors of
higher order (differential forms) play an important role. We shall discuss these in
detail in Chap. 14.
Let t ∈ Tsr (M), X1 , . . . , Xs ∈ X (M) and ω1 , . . . , ωr ∈ X ∗ (M). We consider, for
every p ∈ M,


F (p) = tp ω1 (p), . . . , ωr (p), X1 (p), . . . , Xs (p) .

Tangent Vectors, Vector and Tensor Fields

by t (ω1 , . . . , ωr , X1 , . . . , Xs ). The assignment



ω , . . . , ωr , X1 , . . . , Xs −→ t ω1 , . . . , ωr , X1 , . . . , Xs
is F(M)-multilinear. For every tensor field t ∈ Tsr (M) there is thus an associated
F(M)-multilinear mapping:

back of a one-form ω on N by
 ∗ 
(12.22)
φ ω p (Xp ) := ωφ(p) (Tp φ · Xp ), Xp ∈ Tp (M).
Analogously, we define the pull back of a covariant tensor field t ∈ Ts0 (N ) by

tensor field g ∈ T20 (M) having the properties
(i) g(X, Y ) = g(Y, X) for all X, Y ∈ X (M).
(ii) For every p ∈ M, gp is a non-degenerate bilinear form on Tp (M). This means
that gp (X, Y ) = 0 for all X ∈ Tp (M) if and only if Y = 0.
The tensor field g ∈ T20 (M) is a (proper) Riemannian metric if gp is positive definite
at every point p.
Definition 12.15 A (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold is a differentiable manifold M,
together with a (pseudo-)Riemannian metric g.

If {θ i }, for i = 1, . . . , dim M, is a basis of one-forms on an open subset of M, we
write

The Lie Derivative

Before defining the Lie derivative of tensor fields, we introduce some important
concepts.

13.1 Integral Curves and Flow of a Vector Field
Recall that a curve in a differentiable manifold M is a differentiable map γ : J −→
M from an open interval J of R into M. For such a curve there is a tangent vector
(velocity vector) at each γ (t), t ∈ J , defined by
d
(f ◦ γ )(t), f ∈ F(M).
dt
Equivalently, γ̇ (t) can be regarded as the equivalence class [γ ] at γ (t) in the sense
of Definition 12.6.
Let X be a vector field (as usual C ∞ ).
γ̇ (t)f =

Definition 13.1 Let J be an open interval in R which contains 0. A differentiable
curve γ : J −→ M is called an integral curve of X, with starting point x ∈ M (or
through x ∈ M), provided


γ̇ (t) = X γ (t)
for every t ∈ J and γ (0) = x.
From the well-known existence and uniqueness theorems for ordinary differential
equations one obtains
Theorem 13.1 For every x ∈ M, there is a unique maximal (inextendible) integral
curve through x of class C ∞ .
We denote this curve by φx : Jx −→ M. Let D := {(t, x)|t ∈ Jx , x ∈ M} ⊂
R × M. For every t ∈ R, let Dt := {x ∈ M|(t, x) ∈ D} = {x ∈ M|t ∈ Jx }.

The Lie Derivative

Definition 13.2 The mapping
φ : D −→ M,
(t, x) −→ φx (t)
is called the (maximal local) flow of X, and D is its domain of definition.
Theorem 13.2
(i) D is an open set in R × M and {0} × M ⊂ D (this implies that Dt is an open
subset of M).
(ii) The mapping φ : D −→ M is a C ∞ -morphism.
(iii) For every t ∈ R,
φt : Dt −→ M,
x −→ φ(t, x)
is a diffeomorphism from Dt to D−t , with inverse φ−t .
Corollary 13.1 For every a ∈ M, there is an open interval J , such that 0 ∈ J and
an open neighborhood U of a such that J × U ⊂ D.
Definition 13.3 ψ := φ|J × U : J × U −→ M (i.e. the restriction of φ to J × U )
is called a local flow of X at a.
Theorem 13.3 A local flow ψ : J × U −→ M of X at a has the properties:
(i)
ψx : J −→ M,
t −→ ψ(t, x)
is an integral curve of X with starting point x. Thus, ψ̇x (t) = X(ψx (t)) for
t ∈ J and ψx (0) = x.
(ii)
ψt : U −→ M,
x −→ ψ(t, x)
is a diffeomorphism from U onto ψt (U ).
(iii) If s, t, s + t ∈ J and x ∈ U , then ψs+t (x) = ψs (ψt (x)). In other words,
ψs+t = ψs ◦ ψt .
For this reason, one also calls ψ a local one parameter group of local diffeomorphisms.
Definition 13.4 If D = R × M, then X is said to be complete.

13.2

Mappings and Tensor Fields

601

In this case, we have
Theorem 13.4 If X is complete and φ : R × M −→ M is the global flow of X, then
Dt = M for every t ∈ R and
(i) φt : M −→ M is a diffeomorphism.
(ii) φs ◦ φt = φs+t for s, t ∈ R.
This means that the assignment t −→ φt is a group homomorphism R −→
Diff(M) (Diff(M) denotes the group of all diffeomorphisms of M); the set (φt )t∈R
is a one parameter group of diffeomorphisms of M.
Remark One can show that a vector field on a compact manifold is complete.
Complete proofs of these theorems can be found in Sect. 4.1 of [47].

13.2 Mappings and Tensor Fields
Let φ : M −→ N be a differentiable mapping. This mapping induces a mapping of
covariant tensor fields (see also Sect. 12.3) by means of
Definition 13.5 The pull back φ ∗ : Tq0 (N ) −→ Tq0 (M) is defined by
 ∗ 
φ t x (u1 , . . . , uq ) = tφ(x) (Tx φ · u1 , . . . , Tx φ · uq )
for t ∈ Tq0 (N ) and for arbitrary x ∈ M and u1 , . . . , uq ∈ Tx (M).
Remarks
1. If q = 0, we define φ ∗ : F(N ) −→ F(M) by φ ∗ (f ) = f ◦ φ, f ∈ F(N ).
2. If q = 1, we have
 ∗ 


φ ω (x) = (Tx φ)∗ ω φ(x)
for ω ∈ T10 (N ) and x ∈ M. Here, (Tx φ)∗ denotes the linear transformation dual
to Tx φ.
The following statement is obvious.

is an R-algebra homomorphism of the covariant tensor algebras.

The Lie Derivative

Definition 13.6 The vector fields X ∈ X (M) and Y ∈ X (N ) are said to be φ-related
if
Tx φ · Xx = Yφ(x)
for every x ∈ M.
The next theorem is nontrivial; we prove it in Sect. 16.1.
Theorem 13.6 Let X1 , X2 ∈ X (M) and Y1 , Y2 ∈ X (N ). If Xi and Yi are φ-related
(for i = 1, 2), then so are the commutators [X1 , X2 ] and [Y1 , Y2 ].
In addition we obviously have
Theorem 13.7 Let t ∈ Tq0 (N ), Xi ∈ X (M), Yi ∈ X (N ), i = 1, . . . , q. If the Xi and
Yi are φ-related then
 ∗ 


φ t (X1 , . . . , Xq ) = φ ∗ t (Y1 , . . . , Yq ) .
Let us next consider in particular diffeomorphisms. First recall from linear algebra that if E and F are two vector spaces, and Esr , Fsr are the vector spaces of
tensors of type (r, s) on these spaces, and if the mapping A : E −→ F is an isomorphism, then it induces an isomorphism Ars : Esr −→ Fsr , which is defined as follows:
Let t ∈ Esr ; for arbitrary y1∗ , . . . , yr∗ ∈ F ∗ and y1 , . . . , ys ∈ F ,
 r  ∗



As t y1 , . . . , yr∗ , y1 , . . . , ys := t A∗ y1∗ , . . . , A∗ yr∗ , A−1 y1 , . . . , A−1 ys .
Note that A10 = A and A01 = (A−1 )∗ . In addition, we set A00 = IdR .
Let φ : M −→ N be a diffeomorphism. We define two induced mappings
φ∗ : Tsr (M) −→ Tsr (N )

and φ ∗ : Tsr (N ) −→ Tsr (M),

which are each other’s inverses, by (Tsr φ := (T φ)rs )
(φ∗ t)φ(p) = Tsr φ(tp ) for t ∈ Tsr (M),
 ∗ 
φ t p = Tsr φ −1 (tφ(p) ) for t ∈ Tsr (N ).
It follows immediately that X ∈ X (M) and φ∗ X ∈ X (N ) are φ-related.
The linear extension of φ∗ and φ ∗ to the complete tensor algebras results in two
R-algebra isomorphisms which are mutually inverse and which we also denote by
φ∗ , respectively φ ∗ . Note that the definition of φ ∗ is compatible with (12.23).
Definition 13.7 If φ ∗ t = t for some tensor field t, we say that t is invariant under
the diffeomorphism φ. If φt∗ s = s for every t ∈ R of a one parameter group, we say
that s is invariant under the one parameter group (φt )t∈R .
Exercise 13.1 Derive explicit representations for φ∗ and φ ∗ in terms of coordinates.
The results are similar to the formulas for coordinate changes (as for the passive and
active interpretations of similarity transformations in linear algebra).

13.3 The Lie Derivative
Let X ∈ X (M) and let φt be the flow of X.
Definition 13.8 We set (see Fig. 13.1)
LX T :=



d
φt∗ T = lim t −1 φt∗ T − T ,
t→0
dt t=0

where T ∈ T (M) is an arbitrary element of the algebra of tensor fields on M. LX T
is called the Lie derivative of T with respect to X.

Theorem 13.8 The Lie derivative has the following properties:
(i) LX is R-linear, i.e. LX (T1 + T2 ) = LX (T1 ) + LX (T2 ), LX (λT ) = λLX T ;
(ii) LX (T ⊗ S) = (LX T ) ⊗ S + T ⊗ (LX S) (Leibnitz rule);
(iii) LX (Tsr (M)) ⊆ Tsr (M);
(iv) LX commutes with contractions;
(v) LX f = Xf = df (X), if f ∈ F(M) = T00 (M);
(vi) LX Y = [X, Y ], if Y ∈ X (M).
The only non-obvious statement is property (vi) which we prove in Sect. 16.1.
Theorem 13.9 If X, Y ∈ X (M) and λ ∈ R, then
(i) LX+Y = LX + LY , LλX = λLX ;
(ii) L[X,Y ] = [LX , LY ] = LX ◦ LY − LY ◦ LX .
Proof See Sect. 16.1.



Theorem 13.10 If X, Y ∈ X (M) and φ, ψ are the flows of X and Y , respectively,
then the following statements are equivalent:
(i) [X, Y ] = 0;
(ii) LX ◦ LY = LY ◦ LX ;
(iii) φs ◦ ψt = ψt ◦ φs for all s, t ∈ R (where both sides are defined).
Proof See Sect. 16.1.

The Lie Derivative

Theorem 13.11 Let φt be a one-parameter transformation group and let X be the
corresponding vector field (“infinitesimal transformation”). A tensor field on M is
invariant under φt (i.e. φt∗ T = T for all t) if and only if LX T = 0.
This follows from an important formula derived in Sect. 16.1.
Theorem 13.12 If T ∈ Tq0 (M) is a covariant tensor field and X1 , . . . , Xq ∈ X (M),
then

(LX ω)(Y ) = Xω, Y  − ω [X, Y ] .
(13.2)
As an application, we show that
LX df = dLX f

for f ∈ F(M).

(13.3)

LX df, Y  = Xdf, Y  − df [X, Y ]

A vector field X on a (pseudo-) Riemannian manifold (M, g) is a Killing field

Differential Forms

Cartan’s calculus of differential forms is particularly useful in general relativity (but
also in other fields of physics). We begin our discussion by repeating some algebraic
preliminaries.

14.1 Exterior Algebra
Let A be a commutative, associative, unitary R-algebra and let E be an A-module.
In the following we have either A = R and E a finite dimensional real vector space
or A = F(M) and E = X (M) for some differentiable manifold M.
p
We consider
2p the space T (E) of A-valued, p-multilinear forms on E and the
subspace
(E) of completely antisymmetric multilinear forms. Both spaces can
2
naturally be turned into A-modules. In particular, 0 (E) := T 0 (E) := A and
21
2
(E) = T 1 (E) = E ∗ (dual module of E). The elements of p (E) are called
(exterior) forms of degree p.
Definition 14.1 We define the alternation operator on T p (E) by
(AT )(v1 , . . . , vp ) :=

1 !
(sgn σ )T (vσ (1) , . . . , vσ (p) )
p!

for T ∈ T p (E), (14.1)

σ ∈ Sp

where the sum in (14.1) extends over the permutation group Sp of p objects; sgn σ
denotes the signature of the permutation σ ∈ Sp .
The following statements obviously hold:
(a) A is an A-linear mapping from T p (E) onto
(b) A ◦ A = A.
2
In particular, Aω = ω for any ω ∈ p (E).

Differential Forms

All statements made in Sect. 12.3

is the exterior algebra of differential
forms on M. (Many books use instead the no2
tation Ω p (M), Ω(M).) In (M) the algebraic operations, in particular the exterior
product, are defined pointwise.

As in Sect. 12.3, we can assign to ω ∈ p (M) and vector fields X1 , . . . , Xp the
function


F (x) := ωx X1 (x), . . . , Xp (x) .
This function will be denoted by ω(X1 , . . . , Xp ). The assignment
(X1 , . . . , Xp ) −→ ω(X1 , . . . , Xp )
is F(M)-multilinear
and completely antisymmetric. That is, for a given element
2
ω ∈ p (M), there is an element
2 of the exterior algebra over the F(M)-module
X (M). We denote the latter by (X (M)). One can show that this correspondence
is an isomorphism which preserves all algebraic structures (see [43], p. 137). In
addition, we have for the interior product
3
(iX ω)(x) = iX(x) ω(x), for X ∈ X (M), ω ∈ (M), x ∈ M.
If (x 1 , . . . , x n ) is a local coordinate system in U ⊂ M, then ω ∈

Derivations and Antiderivations

611

(we use the same symbol). Using Theorem 13.5, it is easy to see that
3
φ ∗ (ω ∧ η) = φ ∗ ω ∧ φ ∗ η, ω, η ∈ (N ).
Thus, φ ∗ is an R-algebra homomorphism. If φ is a diffeomorphism, then φ ∗ is an
R-algebra isomorphism.

(iii)
θ (α ∧ β) = θ α ∧ β + α ∧ θβ

for α, β ∈

(14.8)

Theorem 14.4 Every
2 derivation (antiderivation) on (M) is local. This means
that for every α ∈ (M) and every open submanifold U of M, α|U = 0 implies
θ (α)|U = 0.
Proof Let x ∈ U . There exists1 a function h ∈ F(M), such that h(x) = 1 and h = 0
on M \ U . As a consequence, hα = 0 and hence also θ (hα) = 0, so that θ (h) ∧ α +
hθ (α) = 0. If we evaluate this equation at the point x, we obtain θ (α)(x) = 0. 

Corollary 14.1 Let α and α  ∈

2
(M). If α|U = α  |U , then θ (α)|U = θ (α  )|U .

2
Thus 2
we can define2the restriction θ |U on (U ). For this, choose for p ∈ U
and α ∈ (U ) an α̃ ∈ (M) such that α = α̃ for some neighborhood of p, and set
(θ |U )(α)(p) = (θ α̃)(p). According to the corollary, this definition is independent
of the extension α̃. The existence of an extension α̃ is based on the following
Lemma 14.1 Let U2be an open submanifold
2 of M and let K be a compact subset
of U . For every β ∈ (U ) there is an α ∈ (M) such that β|K = α|K and α|(M \
U ) = 0.
Proof There exists a function h ∈ F(M) such that h(x) = 1 for all x ∈ 2
K and h = 0
on M \ U (i.e., supph ⊆ U ).2 With the aid of this function, define α ∈ (M) by
α(x) =

h(x)β(x),
0,

x∈U
x∈

This differential form has the desired properties.

We thus have the following

Theorem 14.5 Let θ be a derivation (antiderivation) on (M) and let U be an

2 exists a unique derivation (antiderivation) θU on

θU is called the derivation (antiderivation) on (U ) induced by θ .
In addition to this localization theorem, we need a globalizing theorem.
Theorem 14.6 Let (Ui )i∈I
2 be an open covering of M. For every i, let θi be a derivation
(antiderivation)
on
(Ui ); we denote by θij the derivation (antiderivation) on
2
(Ui ∩ Uj ) induced by θi on Ui ∩ Uj . For every (i, j ) ∈2I × I let θij = θj i . Then
there exists precisely one derivation (antiderivation) θ on (M) such that θ |Ui = θi
for every i ∈ I .
2
Proof For each α ∈ (M) and i ∈ I , define (θ α)|Ui = θi (α|Ui ). Since




(θ α)|Ui |Uj = θij (α|Ui ∩ Uj ) = θj i (α|Ui ∩ Uj ) = (θ α)|Uj |Ui ,
2
for all (i, j ) ∈ I × I , θ α ∈ (M) is well defined and θ : α −→ θ α is a derivation

(antiderivation) which induces θi on every Ui by construction.
Later on, the following theorem will also be useful:

Theorem 14.7 Let θ be a derivation (antiderivation) of degree k on
2 (M). If θf =
0 and θ (df ) = 0 for every f ∈ F(M), then θ α = 0 for every α ∈ (M).
Proof Let (hi , Ui )i∈I be an atlas of M and let θi = θUi (as in Theorem 14.5). Each
of the theorem, i.e., θi fi = 0 and θi dfi = 0 for every fi ∈
θi satisfies the premises

Corollary 14.2 A derivation (antiderivation) θ on (M) is uniquely determined by
2
2
its value on 0 (M) = F(M) and on 1 (M). In fact, its values on F(M) and all
differentials of F(M) are already sufficient.

14.4 The Exterior Derivative
We are now ready
2 to extend the differential of functions to a very important antiderivation of (M).
Theorem 14.8 There exists precisely one operator
3
3
d : (M) −→ (M)
with the following properties:

2
(i) d is an antiderivation of degree 1 on (M),
(ii) d ◦ d = 0,
(iii) d is the differential of f for every f ∈ F(M), i.e. df, X = Xf for all f ∈
F(M), X ∈ X (M).
The operator d is called the exterior derivative.
Proof
(a) The uniqueness of d is a consequence of Theorem 14.7.

tion. By straightforward computation, one can show that d : (U ) −→ (U )
has the three properties of the theorem (exercise). Thus d is an exterior derivative on U .
2
2
(d) Let (hi , Ui )i∈I be an atlas of M. For every i ∈ I , let di : (Ui ) −→ (Ui )
be the exterior derivative on Ui . For (i, j ) ∈ I × I , di and dj each induces an
exterior derivative dij or dj i , respectively, on Ui ∩ Uj . According2to (a), dij =
dj i . By Theorem 14.6, there exists a unique antiderivation d on (M) which
induces for every i ∈ I the exterior derivative di on Ui . Obviously, d ◦ d = 0
and df is the differential of f for every f ∈ F(M).

Definition 14.6 A differential form α such that dα = 0 is called a closed form.
A differential form α such that α = dβ for some form β is called an exact form.
Since d ◦ d = 0, every exact differential form α = dβ is closed: dα = d(dβ) = 0.
The converse is valid locally:
Lemma 14.2 (Poincaré’s Lemma) Let α be a closed form on M. For every x ∈ M,
there is an open neighborhood U of x such that α|U is exact.
Proof This important fact will be proven in Sect. 16.1.

Relations Among the Operators d, iX and LX

14.4.1 Morphisms and Exterior Derivatives
Theorem 14.9 Let φ : M −→ N be a morphism of manifolds. The following diagram is commutative:

so that
d ◦ φ ∗ = φ ∗ ◦ d.

(14.12)

Proof This has already been shown for functions in Sect. 12.3 and hence we have




d ◦ φ ∗ df = d ◦ d φ ∗ f = 0 = φ ∗ ◦ d(df ).
In other words, (14.12) is also true for differentials of
2functions. In the special case
M = N both sides of (14.12) are antiderivations on (M). By Theorem 14.7, they
must be equal. For the general case we first note
2 that it suffices to prove (14.12)
locally: d(φ ∗ ω|U ) = (φ ∗ dω)|U (U ⊂ M, ω ∈ (N )), since d and φ ∗ are natural
relative to restrictions (e.g., d(α|U ) = (dα)|U ). But the local statement can easily
be verified by a direct calculation (exercise).


14.5 Relations Among the Operators d, iX and LX
There are several important relations between the derivation LX , the antiderivation
iX and the exterior derivative d. The most useful of these is Cartan’s equation
LX = d ◦ iX + iX ◦ d.
Proof
(a) According to Theorem 14.3 the operation
3
3
θ = d ◦ iX + iX ◦ d : (M) −→ (M)
is a derivation of degree 0. For f ∈ F(M) one has
θf = d(iX f ) + iX (df ) = iX df = df, X = Xf
and
θ df = d(iX df ) + iX d(df ) = d(iX df ) = d(Xf ).

= X(Yf ) − [X, Y ]f


= Y Xf = d(Xf ), Y ,
which shows that LX df = d(Xf ).
(c) From (a) and (b) we obtain, using Theorem 14.7, LX = θ .

Corollary 14.3 It follows from (14.13) that
d ◦ LX = LX ◦ d.

i[X,Y ] = [LX , iY ]

for X, Y ∈ X (M).

Proof
(a) If p = 0, (14.16) states that df (X) = Xf , for f ∈ F(M), which is obviously
correct.2
(b) If ω ∈ 1 (M), we obtain from (14.13)
(LX ω)(Y ) = iX dω(Y ) + d(iX ω)(Y )


= iX dω(Y ) + d ω(X) (Y )
= dω(X, Y ) + Y ω(X).

The ∗-Operation and the Codifferential

617

Using (13.1) for LX ω, we find


dω(X, Y ) = (LX ω)(Y ) − Y ω(X) = Xω(Y ) − Y ω(X) − ω [X, Y ] ,
which agrees with the right hand site of (14.16).
(b) We now complete the proof by induction. Assume that (14.16) is correct
for all
2
differential forms having degree less than or equal to p − 1. If ω ∈ p (M), use
(14.13), the induction assumption for iX ω and the explicit expression (13.1) for
LX . After a short calculation, one shows that (14.16) is also true for differential
forms of degree p. (The details are left to the reader.)

14.6 The ∗-Operation and the Codifferential
14.6.1 Oriented Manifolds
Definition 14.7 An atlas A of a differentiable manifold M is oriented if for every
pair of charts (h, U ) and (k, V ) in A the Jacobi determinant for the coordinate
transformation k ◦ h−1 is positive.
There are manifolds (for example, the Möbius strip) which do not have an oriented atlas.
Definition 14.8 A manifold is orientable if it has an oriented atlas. Two atlases
A1 and A2 have the same orientation if A1 ∪ A2 is also an oriented atlas. This is an
equivalence relation. An equivalence class of oriented atlases is called an orientation
of the manifold M. An orientable manifold, together with a chosen orientation, is
said to be an oriented manifold.
A chart (h, U ) of M is said to be positive (negative) if for every chart (k, V )
belonging to some oriented atlas which defines the orientation of M, the Jacobi
determinant of k ◦ h−1 is positive (negative). We state without proof:
Theorem 14.10 Let M be an n-dimensional, paracompact, orientable manifold.
There exists on M an n-form of class C ∞ which does not vanish anywhere on M.
Such a n-form is called a volume form of M. The converse is also true.


Proof See [43], p. 258.

We now consider a pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M, g). Let gij be the components of g relative to the coordinate system (x 1 , . . . , x n ). We set
|g| := det(gij ) .

(14.17)

618

14

Differential Forms

Let ḡij be the components of g in terms of new coordinates (y 1 , . . . , y n ) and let |ḡ|
be the absolute value of the corresponding determinant. From transformation law
ḡij =

∂y i ∂y j

  k 2

then

∂y
a = b det

(14.19)

Because the transformation laws (14.18) and (14.19) agree, there exists globally a
unique n-form η on M that is for a positive coordinate system given by

η := |g| dx 1 ∧ dx 2 ∧ . . . ∧ dx n
(14.20)
In addition, η is a volume form. We call η the canonical or (Riemannian) volume
form on (M, g). It plays an important role.

14.6.2 The ∗-Operation
Let
2n (M, g) be an n-dimensional oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold and let η ∈
(M) be the canonical volume
We shall now use η to
2 form corresponding to g. 2
associate with each form ω ∈ p (M) another form ∗ω ∈ n−p (M). We first do
this with the help of coordinates. So consider a positive local coordinate system
(x 1 , . . . , x n ) and write ω in the form
ω=

1
ωi ...i dx i1 ∧ . . . ∧ dx ip .
p! 1 p

(14.21)

(Note that ωi1 ...ip is totally antisymmetric.) In the same manner, we may write
η=

ηi ...i dx i1 ∧ . . . ∧ dx in .
n! 1 n

(14.24)

where ωi1 ...ip = g i1 j1 . . . g ip jp ωj1 ...jp .
The Definition 14.9 is obviously independent of the coordinate system. In the
Exercise 14.2 below, we derive a coordinate-free expression for the ∗-operation.

(14.35)

Since d ◦ d = 0, we also have
δ ◦ δ = 0.

3 Many authors use the negative of (14.35). One of the reasons for our choice is Eq. (14.37).

14.6

The ∗-Operation and the Codifferential

623

From (14.26) we see that the equation δω = 0 is equivalent to d ∗ ω = 0. Therefore,
by the Lemma of Poincaré (Lemma 14.2), there exists locally a form φ such that
∗ω = dφ. Hence, ω = ± ∗ dφ = δψ , where ψ = ± ∗ φ. Thus, δω = 0 implies the
local existence of a form ψ with ω = δψ .

We now consider an arbitrary ω ∈ n (M) with compact support. Let (Ui , gi )i∈I
be a C ∞ atlas of M, such that (Ui )i∈I is a locally finite covering of M (i.e. for every
x ∈ M there exists a neighborhood U ⊂ M such that U ∩ Ui is nonempty only for a
finite number of i ∈ I ).
Definition 14.11 Let (hi )i∈I be a corresponding partition of unity. This is a family
of differentiable functions (hi )i∈I on M with the following properties:
(i) hi (x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ M;
(ii) supp hi ⊆ Ui ;
(iii)
i∈I hi (x) = 1 for all x ∈ M.
Note that because of (ii) and the local finiteness of the covering, only a finite
number of terms contribute to the sum in (iii).
Remark By definition (see Chap. 11), M has a countable basis. One can show that
M then has a locally finite covering and also that for every such covering, a corresponding partition of unity exists. (For proofs, see Sects. II.14, 15 of [43]).
Since the support of ω is compact and (Ui )i∈I is a locally finite covering,
Ui ∩ supp ω is finite. For hi ω = 0, we have
the number of Ui with non-empty
supp hi ω ⊂ Ui . Since also i∈I hi = 1, we have

One can show that ∂D is a closed, (n − 1)-dimensional submanifold of M (see
Sect. V.5 of [43]). If M is orientable, then ∂D is also orientable. If (x 1 , . . . , x n ) is a
positive coordinate system which satisfies (14.46), then we may choose an orientation of ∂D such that (x 1 , . . . , x n−1 ) is a positive coordinate system of ∂D. However,
the following convention is more suitable: if n is even, then (x 1 , . . . , x n−1 ) is positive, while if n is odd, (x 1 , . . . , x n−1 ) is negative. Such an orientation of ∂D is
called the induced orientation

Affine Connections

In this section we introduce an important additional structure on differentiable manifolds, thus making it possible to define a “covariant derivative” which transforms
tensor fields into other tensor fields.

15.1 Covariant Derivative of a Vector Field
The following definition abstracts certain properties of the directional derivative
in Rn .
Definition 15.1 An affine (linear) connection or on a manifold M is a mapping ∇
which assigns to every pair X, Y of C ∞ vector fields on M another C ∞ vector field
∇X Y with the following properties:
(i) ∇X Y is R-bilinear in X and Y ;
(ii) If f ∈ F(M), then
∇f X Y = f ∇X Y,
∇X (f Y ) = f ∇X Y + X(f )Y.
Such a mapping ∇ is called a covariant derivative.
We show that ∇ can be localized.
Lemma 15.1 Let ∇ be an affine connection on M and let U be an open subset
of M. If either X or Y vanishes on U , then ∇X Y also vanishes on U .
Proof Suppose Y vanishes on U . Let p ∈ U . Choose, as in Sect. 14.3, a function
h ∈ F(M) with h(p) = 0 and h = 1 on M \ U . From hY = Y it follows that ∇X Y =
∇X (hY ) = X(h)Y + h∇X Y . This vanishes at p. The statement about X follows
similarly.

Affine Connections

This lemma shows that an affine connection ∇ on M induces a connection on
every open submanifold U of M. In fact, let X, Y ∈ X (U ) and p ∈ U . Then there
exist vector fields X̃, Ỹ ∈ X (M) which coincide with X, respectively Y on an open
neighborhood V of p (see the continuation Lemma 14.1 of Sect. 14.3). We then set
(∇|U )X Y |q = (∇X̃ Ỹ )|q ,

for q ∈ V .

By Lemma 15.1, the right-hand side is independent of the choice of X̃, Ỹ ∈ X (M).
∇|U is obviously an affine connection on U .
We show that (∇X Y )p depends on X only via Xp , whence ∇v Y is well-defined
for v ∈ Tp M.
Lemma 15.2 Let X, Y ∈ X (M). If X vanishes at p, then ∇X Y also vanishes at p.
Proof Let U be a coordinate neighborhood of p. On U , we have the representation
X = ξ i ∂/∂x i with ξ i ∈ F(U ), where ξ i (p) = 0. Then, using the previous Lemma,
(∇X Y )p = ξ i (p)(∇∂/∂x i Y )p = 0.

(15.4)

Conversely, if for every chart there exist n3 function Γ kij which transform according to (15.4) under a change of coordinates, then it is straightforward to show
that there exists a unique affine connection ∇ on M which satisfies (15.1).
For every vector field X we can introduce the tensor field ∇X ∈ T11 (M), defined
by
∇X(Y, ω) := ω, ∇Y X,

(15.5)

where ω is a 1-form. ∇X is the covariant derivative (or absolute derivative) of X.
In a chart (U, x 1 , . . . , x n ) let
X = ξ i ∂i

with ∂i := ∂/∂i ,

∇X = ξ i;j dx j ⊗ ∂i .
Then one has

= dx i , ξ k,j ∂k + ξ k Γ js k ∂s

so that
ξ i;j = ξ i,j + Γ ij k ξ k .

(15.6)

Definition 15.3 An affine connection is called symmetric if
∇X Y − ∇Y X = [X, Y ].

(15.7)

This is easily seen to be equivalent to the symmetry property Γ kij = Γ kj i for any
coordinate system.

15.2 Parallel Transport Along a Curve
Definition 15.4 Let γ : J −→ M be a curve in M with velocity field γ̇ (t), and let
X be a vector field which is defined on an open neighborhood of γ (J ). X is said to
be parallel (parallelly transported) along γ if
∇γ̇ X = 0

(15.8)

on γ . The vector ∇γ̇ X is sometimes denoted by DX
dt or dt (covariant derivative
along γ ).

(15.10)

In connection with (15.9) we can state more precisely:
Proposition 15.1 For a given curve γ : J −→ M there is unique map from the set
X (γ ) of smooth vector fields along γ into X (γ ), X −→ ∇X/dt, called the induced
covariant derivative, such that
(i) ∇(a1 X1 + a2 X2 )/dt = a1 ∇X/dt + a2 ∇X/dt, with a1 , a2 ∈ R;
(ii) ∇(f X)/dt = (df/dt)X + f ∇X/dt, with f ∈ F(J );
(iii) For X ∈ X (M) and X̄ = X|γ we have
∇ X̄
= ∇γ̇ X
dt
along γ .


Proof The easy proof is left to the reader.

We shall generalize this in Sect. 16.3.
For a given curve γ (t) with X0 ∈ Tγ (0) (M) there exists a unique parallel field
X(t) along γ with X(t) ∈ Tγ (t) (M) and X(0) = X0 . Since the equation for X(t) is
linear, there is no limitation on t. For every curve γ and any two points γ (s) and
γ (t), there is then a linear isomorphism
τt,s : Tγ (s) (M) −→ Tγ (t) (M),
which transforms a vector v at γ (s) into the parallel transported vector v(t) at γ (t)
(see Fig. 15.1). The mapping τt,s is the parallel transport along γ from γ (s) to γ (t).
We have, as a result of the uniqueness theorem for ordinary differential equations,
τt,s ◦ τs,r = τt,r

and τs,s = Id.

(15.11)

We can now give a geometrical interpretation of the covariant derivative that will
later be generalized to tensor fields.

15.3 Geodesics, Exponential Mapping and Normal Coordinates
Definition 15.5 A curve γ is a geodesic if γ̇ is parallel along γ , i.e., ∇γ̇ γ̇ = 0.
In local coordinates, (15.10) implies that along a geodesic
ẍ k + Γ kij ẋ i ẋ j = 0.

(15.13)

For given γ (0), γ̇ (0) there exists a unique maximal geodesic γ (t); this is an immediate consequence of the existence and uniqueness theorems of ordinary differential equations. If γ (t) is a geodesic, then γ (at), a ∈ R, is also a geodesic, with initial

636

15

velocity a γ̇ (0). Hence, for some neighborhood V of 0 ∈ Tx (M), the geodesics γv ,
with γv (0) = x and γ̇v (0) = v ∈ V , exist for all t ∈ [0, 1]. We introduce the exponential mapping at x by (see Fig. 15.2)
expx : v ∈ V → γv (1).
Obviously γtv (s) = γv (ts). If we set s = 1, we obtain expx (tv) = γv (t). The mapping expx is differentiable1 at v and the last equation implies T expx (0) = Id, since
T expx (0)v =

d
expx (tv) = γ̇v (0) = v
dt t=0

for all v ∈ Tx (M). As an application of the implicit function theorem we then obtain
Theorem 15.2 The mapping expx is a diffeomorphism from a neighborhood of 0 ∈
Tx (M) to a neighborhood of x ∈ M.
This theorem permits the introduction of special coordinates. If we choose a
basis e1 , . . . , en of Tx (M), then we can represent a neighborhood of x uniquely
by expx (x i ei ). The functions (x 1 , . . . , x n ) are known as normal coordinates. Since
expx (tv) = γv (t), the curve γv (t) has normal coordinates x i = v i t, with v = v i ei .
In terms of these coordinates, (15.13) becomes
Γ kij v i v j = 0;
hence we have Γ kij (0) + Γ kj i (0) = 0. If the connection is symmetric, it follows that
Γ kij (0) = 0. This fact will turn out to be important.

15.4 Covariant Derivative of Tensor Fields
We now extend the parallel transport τs,t of Sect. 15.2 to arbitrary tensors. If α ∈
Tγ∗(s) (M), we define τt,s α ∈ Tγ∗(t) (M) by
τt,s α, τt,s v = α, v

for all v ∈ Tγ (s) (M),

Now let X be a vector field and γ (t) be an integral curve of X, starting at p, so

put ∇X f = Xf . Finally ∇X is extended to a linear mapping of T (M).
Proposition 15.2 ∇X is a derivation of the tensor algebra T (M).
Proof Obviously, τs (S1 ⊗ S2 ) = (τs S1 ) ⊗ (τs S2 ). From this we obtain the Leibniz

Proposition 15.3 ∇X commutes with contractions.
Proof We give a proof for the special case S = Y ⊗ ω, Y ∈ X (M), ω ∈ X ∗ (M).
The general case is completely analogous. If C denotes the contraction operation,
we have by (15.14)

In the limit s → 0 we obtain, with the definition (15.16),

C ∇X (Y ⊗ ω) = ∇X C(Y ⊗ ω) .

15.4.1 Application
Since, according to Proposition 15.2,
∇X (Y ⊗ ω) = (∇X Y ) ⊗ ω + Y ⊗ ∇X ω
we have, after contraction, and use of Proposition 15.3,


∇X ω(Y ) = ω(∇X Y ) + (∇X ω)(Y )
or
(∇X ω)(Y ) = Xω(Y ) − ω(∇X Y ).

(15.17)

Equation (15.17) gives an expression for the covariant derivative of an 1-form. Note
that ∇X ω is F(M)-linear in X. Because of the derivation property, ∇X is then
F(M)-linear on the entire tensor algebra:
∇f X S = f ∇X S

for all f ∈ F(M), S ∈ T (M).

Hence we can define a mapping

∇ : Tp (M) −→ Tp+1 (M)

(∇S)(X1 , . . . , Xp+1 , ω1 , . . . , ωq )
= (∇Xp+1 S)(X1 , . . . , Xp , ω1 , . . . , ωq ).

(15.18)

∇S is the covariant derivative of the tensor field S. We easily obtain a general
q
expression for ∇S, S ∈ Tp (M), by generalizing the previous discussion: If ωi are
1-forms and Yj are vector fields, then
∇X (Y1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ Yq ⊗ ω1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ ωp ⊗ S)
= ∇X Y1 ⊗ Y2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ S + . . . + Y1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ Yq ⊗ ∇X ω1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ S + . . .

From this we find the following formula for ∇X S,

If we use (15.20)–(15.22) in (15.19) for ωj = dx j and Yi = ∂i , we obtain an expresi ...i

15.5 Curvature and Torsion of an Affine Connection, Bianchi
Identities
We now introduce two important tensor fields, associated to an affine connection.
Definition 15.6 Let ∇ be an affine connection on M. The torsion is defined as the
mapping T : X (M) × X (M) −→ X (M),
T (X, Y ) = ∇X Y − ∇Y X − [X, Y ],

(15.26)

and the curvature as the mapping R : X (M) × X (M) × X (M) −→ X (M),
R(X, Y )Z = ∇X (∇Y Z) − ∇Y (∇X Z) − ∇[X,Y ] Z.

Note that
T (X, Y ) = −T (Y, X),

R(X, Y ) = −R(Y, X).

One can easily verify that
T (f X, gY ) = f gT (X, Y ),

R(f X, gY )hZ = fghR(X, Y )Z

for all f, g, h ∈ F(M). The mapping
X ∗ (M) × X (M) × X (M) −→ F(M),


(ω, X, Y ) −→ ω, T (X, Y )
is thus a tensor field in T21 (M) and is known as the torsion tensor. Similarly, the
mapping (ω, Z, X, Y ) −→ ω, R(X, Y )Z is a tensor field in T31 (M). This curvature tensor plays a central role in general relativity.
In local coordinates the components of the torsion tensor are given by

T kij = Γ kij − Γ kj i .

(15.29)

If the torsion vanishes, we have Γ kij = Γ kj i in every chart. Then Γ kij (x0 ) = 0 in
normal coordinates with origin x0 , as mentioned at the end of Sect. 15.3.
The components of the curvature tensor are (the ordering of the indices is important):

According to (15.19), the right-hand side is

− (∇[X,Y ] ∇Z − ∇Z ∇[X,Y ] − ∇[[X,Y ],Z] ) + cyclic permutations.
If one uses the Jacobi identity, the last term in the cyclic sum drops out. The remaining terms transform in pairs into each other under cyclic permutation, except for
the sign, and thus cancel in pairs in the cyclic sum. This proves the second Bianchi
identity.
We now prove the first Bianchi identity for T = 0. In that case the left-hand side
of (15.34) is
(∇X ∇Y − ∇Y ∇X )Z + (∇Y ∇Z − ∇Z ∇Y )X + (∇Z ∇X − ∇X ∇Z )Y

The general case (T = 0) is left as an exercise.

15.6 Riemannian Connections
Definition 15.8 Let (M, g) be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. An affine connection is a metric connection if parallel transport along any smooth curve γ in M preserves the inner product: For parallel fields X(t), Y (t) along γ , gγ (t) (X(t), Y (t)) is
independent of t.

∇g = 0.

Because of the group property of τt,s this is equivalent to the same condition for
t = s. By (15.15) and (15.16), this is equivalent to ∇γ̇ g = 0.

Remark As a result of (15.19), ∇g = 0 is equivalent to the so-called Ricci identity
Xg(Y, Z) = g(∇X Y, Z) + g(Y, ∇X Z).

(15.39)

The following result is often called the miracle of pseudo-Riemannian geometry.
Although not very deep, it is of prime importance.
Theorem 15.4 For every pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M, g), there exists a
unique affine connection ∇ such that
(i) ∇ has vanishing torsion (∇ is symmetric);
(ii) ∇ is metric.
Proof From the Ricci-identity (15.39) and (i) we obtain


Xg(Y, Z) = g(∇Y X, Z) + g [X, Y ], Z + g(Y, ∇X Z).
From this we obtain through cyclic permutation


Y g(Z, X) = g(∇Z Y, X) + g [Y, Z], X + g(Z, ∇Y X),


Zg(X, Y ) = g(∇X Z, Y ) + g [Z, X], Y + g(X, ∇Z Y ).

(15.40)

(15.41a)
(15.41b)

Taking the linear combination (15.41a) + (15.41b) − (15.40) results in the Koszul

− g [Z, X], Y − g [Y, Z], X + g [X, Y ], Z .

(15.42)

The right-hand side is independent of ∇. Since g is non-degenerate, the uniqueness
of ∇ follows from (15.42).
Now, we prove the existence: Define the mapping ω : X (M) −→ F(M), 2ω(X)
equal to the right-hand side of (15.42). The mapping ω is clearly additive, and is
also F(M)-homogeneous, ω(f X) = f ω(X), as can be demonstrated by a short
computation (exercise). To the 1-form ω there corresponds a unique vector field
∇Z Y with g(∇Z Y, X) = ω(X). The mapping ∇ : X (M) × X (M) −→ X (M) defined in this manner satisfies the defining properties of an affine connection (see
Definition 15.1): additivity in Y and Z is obvious, and homogeneity in Z is easily
demonstrated by a short calculation. We now verify the derivation property, writing
X, Y  instead of g(X, Y ):

15.6.1 Local Expressions
We determine the Christoffel symbols of the Riemannian connection in a chart
(U, x 1 , . . . , x n ). For this purpose take X = ∂k , Y = ∂j and Z = ∂i in (15.42) and
use [∂i , ∂j ] = 0, as well as ∂i , ∂j  = gij . The result is

Note also that for coordinates which are normal at x0 , the Ricci identity
∂k gij = ∇∂k ∂i , ∂j  + ∂i , ∇∂k ∂j 
implies that the first derivatives of gij vanish at x0 .

Use of the second Bianchi identity (15.45b) results in
Rjm;m = −g ml g ik (Rklj m;i + Rklmi;j ).
According to (15.47c), (15.47d) and (15.52), the first term on the right hand side is
equal to

basis of C ∞ vector fields2 defined on an open subset U (which might be the domain
of a chart, for example), and let (θ 1 , . . . , θ n )2denote the corresponding dual basis of
1-forms. We define connection forms ωij ∈ 1 (U ) by
∇X ej = ωij (X)ei .

(15.56)

We may generalize the definition of the Christoffel symbols (relative to the basis
{ei }) as follows:
∇ek ej = Γ ikj ei = ωij (ek )ei .
Thus,
ωij = Γ ikj θ k .

(15.57)

Since ∇X commutes with contractions, we have, according to (15.56),

The torsion and the curvature define differential forms Θ i (torsion forms) and
Ω ij (curvature forms) by
T (X, Y ) = Θ i (X, Y )ei ,

(15.63)

R(X, Y )ej = Ω ij (X, Y )ei .

(15.64)

Theorem 15.5 The torsion forms and curvature forms satisfy the Cartan structure
equations
Θ i = dθ i + ωij ∧ θ j ,

(15.65)

Ω ij = dωij + ωik ∧ ωkj .

(15.66)

Ω ij (X, Y )ei = ∇X ∇Y ej − ∇Y ∇X ej − ∇[X,Y ] ej

15.7.1 Solution of the Structure Equations
We expand dθ i in terms of the basis θ i :
1
dθ i = − C ij k θ j ∧ θ k ,
2

C ij k = −C ikj .

(15.72)

Comparison with the first structure equation gives
Γ ikl − Γ ilk = C ikl .

(15.73)

i are symmetric in k and l.
Remark For θ i = dx i , we have C ikl = 0 and the Γ kl

In addition we set
dgij = gij,k θ k ,

gij,k = ek (gij ).

(15.74)

Since, according to (15.57), ωij = gis Γ slj θ l , the first equation in (15.71) implies
gij,k = gis Γ skj + gj s Γ ski .

(15.75)

We take cyclic permutations to obtain
gj k,i = gj s Γ sik + gks Γ sij ,

(15.76)

gki,j = gks Γ sj i + gis Γ sj k .

(15.77)

Forming the combination (15.75) + (15.76) − (15.77), and using (15.73) results in


gij,k + gj k,i − gki,j = gis C skj + gks C sij + gj s Γ ski + Γ sik .
If we contract this equation with g lj , we obtain

According to (15.57), we have
dωij = dΓ ilj ∧ θ l + Γ ilj dθ l .
We now set dΓ ilj = Γ ilj,s θ s = es (Γ ilj )θ s and use (15.72). The result is

Thus, the components of the curvature tensor are given by
R ij ab = Γ ibj,a − Γ iaj,b − Γ ilj C lab + Γ ial Γ lbj − Γ ibl Γ laj .

(15.79)

Remark Cartan’s structure equations are also useful for curvature calculations, as
we shall see in many instances. The reader is invited to study at this point the application to “warped products” of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds in Appendix B.

15.8 Bianchi Identities for the Curvature and Torsion Forms
In the following we again consider an arbitrary affine connection ∇ on a manifold M. As before, let {ei } and {θ i } be mutually dual bases and let ωij denote the
connection forms.
Proposition 15.7 Under a change of basis
θ̄ i (x) = Aij (x)θ j (x),

(15.80)

ω = (ωij ) transforms in matrix notation as follows
ω̄ = AωA−1 − dAA−1 .

(15.81)

654

15

Affine Connections

Proof In an obvious matrix notation we have, according to (15.58),
∇X θ̄ = −ω̄(X)θ̄ = ∇X (Aθ ) = dA(X)θ + A∇X θ
= dA(X)θ − Aω(X)θ = dA(X)A−1 θ̄ − Aω(X)A−1 θ̄ .


From this the conclusion follows immediately.

We emphasize that the ωij are not the components of a tensor valued form in the
sense of the
Definition 15.11 A tensor valued p-form of type (r, s) is a skew symmetric pmultilinear mapping

The p-forms φji11...i

Proposition 15.8 For every tensor valued p-form φ of type (r, s) there exists a
unique tensor valued (p + 1)-form Dφ, also of type (r, s), which has the following
components relative to the basis {θ i }:

(15.82)

Proof It suffices to show that the right-hand side of (15.82) transforms like the components of a tensor of type (r, s) under a change of basis θ̄ (x) = A(x)θ (x). Since
every pair of upper and lower indices in (15.82) behaves in the same manner, we
consider a tensor valued p-form φji of type (1, 1). The transformed components
φ̄ = (φ̄ji ) are given by φ̄ = AφA−1 . In addition,
D φ̄ = d φ̄ + ω̄ ∧ φ̄ − (−1)p φ̄ ∧ ω̄,
or, using (15.81) and dAA−1 = −A dA−1 ,

The tensor valued (p + 1)-form Dφ of Proposition 15.8 is known as the absolute
exterior differential of the tensor valued p-form φ.


15.8.1 Special Cases
(a) A “usual” p-form is a tensor valued form of type (0, 0) and for this case we
have D = d.
(b) A tensor field t ∈ Tsr (M) is a tensor valued 0-form of type (r, s) and
Dt = ∇t

(15.83)

Indeed, for a coordinate basis θ i = dx i , (15.82) reduces with the help of (15.57)
to (15.23).
It follows trivially from (15.82) that D satisfies the antiderivation rule for two
tensor valued forms:
D(φ ∧ ψ) = Dφ ∧ ψ + (−1)p φ ∧ Dψ,

(15.84)

where p is the degree of φ. Here, ∧ denotes exterior multiplication of the components.3
Remarks
1. A connection is metric if and only if Dg = 0.
2. The basis θ i is a tensor valued 1-form of type (1, 0). The first structure equation
can be written in the form
Dθ i = Θ i ,

(15.85)

as one easily infers from (15.82).
We may now write the Bianchi identities in a very compact form. Obviously, Θ i
and Ω ij are tensor valued 2-forms of type (1, 0) and (1, 1), respectively (see the
defining equations (15.63), (15.64)).
Proposition 15.9 The torsion and curvature forms satisfy the following identities:

Proof Using (15.82) and Cartan’s structure equations we have, in matrix notation,
DΘ = dΘ + ω ∧ Θ
= d(dθ + ω ∧ θ ) + ω ∧ (dθ + ω ∧ θ )
= dω ∧ θ − ω ∧ dθ + ω ∧ dθ + ω ∧ ω ∧ θ = Ω ∧ θ.
In an analogous manner,
DΩ = dΩ + ω ∧ Ω − Ω ∧ ω = dΩ + ω ∧ dω − dω ∧ ω,
dΩ = d(dω + ω ∧ ω) = dω ∧ ω − ω ∧ dω
and hence DΩ = 0.

We now show that (15.86a) and (15.86b) are equivalent to the previous formulations of the Bianchi identities (15.34), (15.35). In a natural basis θ i = dx i , (15.86a)

15.9 Locally Flat Manifolds
Definition 15.12 Let (M, g) and (N, h) be two pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.
A diffeomorphism φ : M −→ N is an isometry if φ ∗ h = g. Every pseudoRiemannian manifold which is isometric to (Rn , ḡ), with
ḡ =

!

εi dx i dx i ,

εi = ±1

(15.93)

i=1

is said to be flat. If a space is locally isometric to a flat space, then it is said to by
locally flat.
Theorem 15.6 A pseudo-Riemannian space is locally flat if and only if the curvature of the Riemannian connection vanishes.
Proof If the space is locally flat, the curvature vanishes. In order to see this, choose
a chart in the neighborhood of a point for which the metric has the form (15.93). In
this neighborhood the Christoffel symbols vanish and hence also the curvature.
In order to prove the converse, we use Theorem 15.7 below. According to this
theorem, parallel transport is locally independent of the path when Ω ij = 0. Hence
it is possible to parallel displace a basis of vectors in Tp (M), p ∈ M, to all points in
some neighborhood of p. In this manner we obtain local basis fields ei which have
vanishing covariant derivative. For the basis {θ i } dual to {ei } we always have


dθ i (ej , ek ) = −θ i [ej , ek ] .
But for a symmetric connection
[ej , ek ] = ∇ej ek − ∇ek ej = 0.
Consequently dθ i = 0. According to the Lemma of Poincaré (Lemma 14.2) there
exist local functions x i : U −→ R, p ∈ U , for which θ i = dx i . If we choose these
x i as coordinates, then ei = ∂/∂x i and
0 = ∇ei ej = Γ kij ek .
Thus the Γ kij vanish identically in the coordinate system {x i } in a neighborhood
of p. If the connection is pseudo-Riemannian, then the metric coefficients gik are
constant in the neighborhood U (see, e.g., (15.70)). In this case, they can be transformed to the normal form (15.93) by a suitable choice of coordinates.

Theorem 15.7 For an affine connection, parallel transport is independent of the
path if and only if the curvature tensor vanishes.
We prove this theorem after the following heuristic discussion. Let γ : [0, 1] −→
M be a closed path, with γ (0) = p. We displace an arbitrary vector v0 ∈ Tp (M)

15.9

parallel along γ and obtain the field v(t) = τt v0 , v(t) ∈ Tγ (t) (M). We assume that
the closed path is sufficiently small that we can work in the image of some particular
chart. Then v̇ i = −Γ ji k ẋ j v k . We are interested in

Equation (15.95) implies heuristically Theorem 15.7. We now give a rigorous proof
of this theorem.
Proof of Theorem 15.7 Consider a 1-parameter family of curves H (t, s), (α ≤ t ≤
β), s in the open interval J , with H (α, s) = p and H (β, s) = q, for all s ∈ J .
Let v ∈ Tp (M) and let Y (t, s) be the set of vectors which one obtains by parallel
displacement of v along t −→ H (t, s) for every fixed s. Let V be the field tangent
to the curves t −→ H (t, s) and T be the field tangent to the curves s −→ H (t, s)
(for fixed t). With this notation, we have Y (α, s) = v, s ∈ J , and
(∇V Y )t,s = 0,

(∇T Y )α,s = 0.

(15.96)

Naturally, [V , T ] = 0 since differentiation with respect to s and t is commutative
(see the Remark below). Now suppose that the curvature vanishes. It follows from
(15.96) that
∇V ∇T Y |t,s = ∇T ∇V Y |t,s = 0,
which means that the family t −→ ∇T Y is parallel along t −→ H (t, s). Together
with the second equation of (15.96) this implies
∇T Y |t,s = 0.

Fig. 15.3 Parallel transport
along a one-parameter family
of paths between two points

One thus obtains the same result whether v is transported parallel along the path
segment γ1 or γ2 in Fig. 15.3. By going to the limit, one sees that parallel displacement to q is independent of the path.
Conversely, assume that parallel displacement is independent of the path. Then
(15.97) is valid, and from this we conclude that
(∇V ∇T − ∇T ∇V )Y = R(V , T )Y = 0
for all t, s and hence that Ω = 0.

and, interchanging X with Y ,
∇ω(Y, X) = Xω(Y ) − ω(∇X Y ).
We consider the difference and the sum of the two equations. According to (14.16)
the difference is equal to −dω(X, Y ). For the sum we get
Xω(Y ) + Y ω(X) − ω(∇X Y + ∇Y X)
= Xg(K, Y ) + Y g(K, X) − g(K, ∇X Y + ∇Y X) = (LK g)(X, Y ).
The last equality sign is obtained as follows. From general formulas we get
(LK g)(X, Y ) = Kg(X, Y ) − g

The first three terms add up to ∇g(X, Y ) = 0. Applying the Ricci identity to the last
two terms gives the claimed equality. Together we obtain the identity (15.104).

Covariant Derivatives of Tensor Densities

663

As always, a square bracket enclosing a group of indices denotes antisymmetrization
in these indices, while a round bracket means symmetrization.
The Weyl tensor Cij kl has the same symmetries as Rij kl . It behaves very simply
under conformal transformations g̃ = e2φ g:
C̃ij kl = e2φ Cij kl .

(15.111)

For this reason it is often called the conformal tensor.
An important property of the Weyl tensor is that for n ≥ 4 it vanishes if and only
if the metric is locally conformally flat. (For a proof, see, e.g., [55].)

15.11 Covariant Derivatives of Tensor Densities
Let M be an n-dimensional manifold. A density on M is a rule which assigns to each
chart (U ; x 1 , . . . , x n ) a (smooth) function ρ of x 1 , . . . , x n , such that the following
transformation law holds
 k
∂x
.
(15.112)
ρ̄(x̄) = ρ(x) det
∂ x̄ l
An example is ρ(x) = |g(x)|1/2 for a pseudo-Riemannian manifold (see (3.80)).
Alternatively, a density can be defined as a rule which assigns to each p ∈ M a
function ρ̂p on n tangent vectors in Tp M, subject to the property4
ρ̂p (Av1 , . . . , Avn ) = | det A|ρ̂p (v1 , . . . , vn ),

(15.113)

where vi ∈ Tp M and A is a linear transformation of Tp M. If we associate to ρ̂ for
each chart the function ρ̂(∂1 , . . . , ∂n ), we obtain a density in the sense of the original
definition. Conversely, given a density ρ in the sense of the original definition, we
obtain a density ρ̂ in the sense of the second definition by setting
ρ̂p (v1 , . . . , vn ) = | det B|ρ(∂1 , . . . , ∂n ),
where vi = B∂i . Verify that ρ̂p satisfies (15.113).
Given an affine connection ∇ on M, we define the covariant derivative of a density ρ̂ by adopting (15.16):
(∇X ρ̂)p =

d
τ −1 ρ̂γ (s) ,
ds s=0 s

where the parallel transport of ρ̂p is naturally defined by


τs ρ̂p (v1 , . . . , vn ) = ρ̂p τs−1 v1 , . . . , τs−1 vn .

Remarks
1. Consider the special case when M is an oriented manifold, then we can associate
to ρ an n-form Ω by
Ω = ρ dx 1 ∧ . . . ∧ dx n
for a positive coordinate system. If we require that the relation ρ ↔ Ω is respected by ∇X , ∇X Ω ↔ ∇X ρ, then we obtain again (15.116).
2. The reader is invited to carry out an analogous discussion for the Lie derivative
of densities. (For details, see [56].)
3. Without giving precise definitions, the notion of a tensor density (tensor valued
density) and its covariant derivative, should be obvious. Examples of tensor densities are ‘products’ of densities and tensors; actually each tensor density can be
represented in this way. In local coordinates, the components of ∇S of a tensor
density S of type p, q are given by

Some Details and Supplements

In this section we give detailed proofs of some of the theorems formulated in previous sections. In addition, we clarify the notion of vector fields along maps and their
induced covariant derivatives, because this is used at various places in the book.
For a convenient formulation we introduce the tangent bundle of a manifold, the
prototype of a vector bundle. Applications to variations of curves will illustrate the
usefulness of the concepts.

16.1 Proofs of Some Theorems
Proof of Theorem 13.6
(a) First we show the following: Let DX , DY be the derivations of F(M), F(N )
respectively, belonging to the vector fields X and Y . Then X and Y are φrelated in the sense of Definition 13.6 if and only if φ ∗ ◦ DY = DX ◦ φ ∗ . To see
this we note
DX ◦ φ ∗ (f )|p = DX (f ◦ φ)|p = Xp (f ◦ φ) = (Tp φ · Xp )f
and
φ ∗ ◦ DY (f )|p = (DY f )|φ(p) = Yφ(p) f.
The left-hand sides of these two equations are obviously equal if and only if X
and Y are φ-related.
(b) With a straightforward calculation one establishes the following: Suppose that
derivations Di and Di , i = 1, 2, are related as
φ ∗ ◦ Di = Di ◦ φ ∗ ,
then φ ∗ ◦ [D1 , D2 ] = [D1 , D2 ] ◦ φ ∗ .

Proof of Theorem 13.8 Only the last statement LX Y = [X, Y ] is not obvious. To
show this the following remark is useful. Let f : (−ε, ε) × M −→ R be smooth
(C ∞ ) and f (0, p) = 0 for all p ∈ M, then there is a C ∞ function g : (−ε, ε) ×
M −→ R with
∂f
(0, p) = g(0, p).
∂t

f (t, p) = tg(t, p),

(16.1)

A function with these properties is
g(t, p) =

 1

f  (st, p) ds,

0

where the prime denotes the derivative of f with respect to the first argument.
Now let f ∈ F(M) and φt be the flow of X, |t| < ε. From what has just been
said we know that there is a family of C ∞ functions gt on M such that
f ◦ φt = f + tgt ,

g0 = Xf.

(16.2)

The last proposition of Theorem 13.8 is equivalent to
1
[X, Y ]p = lim [Yp − Tp φt · Yq ],
t→0 t

q = φ−t (p)

or
1
[X, Y ] = lim [Y − φt∗ Y ].
t→0 t
For calculating the right-hand side we determine its action on f . We have, using
Eq. (16.2),
(φt∗ Y )p (f ) = (Tq φt · Yq )(f ) = Yq (f ◦ φt ) = Yφ−t (p) (f + tgt ),
so
1
Yp − (φt∗ Y )p (f )

Proofs of Some Theorems

667

Proof of Theorem 13.9 Both statements will immediately follow from the
Lemma 16.1 Two derivations of the algebra of tensor fields T (M), which preserve
the type and commute with all contractions, are equal if they agree on F(M) and
X (M).
Before we prove this, we show that the Lemma implies Theorem 13.9. The first
statement of this theorem is obvious. The second statement follows from
[LX , LY ]f = XYf − Y Xf = [X, Y ]f = L[X,Y ] f,
for f ∈ F(M), and, using the Jacobi identity,
[LX , LY ]Z = X, [Y, Z] − Y, [X, Z] = [X, Y ], Z ,
for Z ∈ X (M).

Proof of Lemma 16.1 First one shows, as in the proof of Theorem 14.4, that derivations can be localized. Lemma 16.1 is equivalent to the statement that for a derivation D with the stated properties, D|F(M) = 0 and D|X (M) = 0 imply that D = 0.
Now, K ∈ Tsr (M) can locally be represented on the domain of a chart as

As a preparation for the proof of Theorem 13.10 we need the
Proposition 16.1 Let ϕ be a diffeomorphism of M and X ∈ X (M) with local flow
φt . Then ϕ ◦ φt ◦ ϕ −1 is a local flow of ϕ∗ X.
Proof Obviously, ϕ ◦ φt ◦ ϕ −1 is a local one-parameter group of local transformations. Let p ∈ M be an arbitrary point and q = ϕ −1 (p). The vector Xq ∈ Tq (M)
is tangential to the curve γ (t) = φt (q) at q = γ (0). Hence (ϕ∗ X)p = Tq ϕ · Xq ∈

Tp (M) is tangential to the curve γ̃ = ϕ ◦ γ , γ̃ (t) = (ϕ ◦ φt ◦ ϕ −1 )(p).
Corollary 16.1 The vector field X ∈ X (M) is invariant under ϕ (i.e., ϕ∗ X = X) if
and only if
ϕ ◦ φt = φt ◦ ϕ.

Proof of Theorem 13.10 The Corollary 16.1 implies, that from φt ◦ ψs = ψs ◦ φt follows the invariance of Y under φt and thus LX Y = 0, i.e., [X, Y ] = 0. Furthermore,
using the definition of the Lie derivative we conclude from (φt ◦ ψs )∗ = ψs∗ ◦ φt∗ =
(ψs ◦ φt )∗ = φt∗ ◦ ψs∗ that LX ◦ LY = LY ◦ LX . Conversely, let [X, Y ] = 0. Then
Proposition 16.2 below implies
d
φt∗ Y = 0,
dt
for every t in the domain of definition. Thus φt∗ Y is constant in any point p ∈ M,
so Y is invariant under φt . By the Corollary ψs commutes with every φt . As above
this implies LX ◦ LY = LY ◦ LX . Finally, let us assume the second property of
Theorem 13.10: LX ◦ LY = LY ◦ LX . By the second statement of Theorem 13.9 we

then have L[X,Y ] = 0, and thus [X, Y ] = 0.

Remark Formula (16.5) implies, in particular, the statement of Theorem 13.11.

16.2 Tangent Bundles
Definition 16.1 If M is an n-dimensional differentiable manifold, the tangent bundle of M, denoted by T M, is the disjoint union of all tangent spaces of M:
4
Tp M.
(16.6)
TM =
p∈M

Thus elements (points) of T M are tangent vectors to M at some point p ∈ M.
The natural projection πM : T M −→ M maps a tangent vector v ∈ Tp M to the
−1
point p ∈ M at which the vector v is attached. Obviously, the inverse image πM
(p)
is the tangent space Tp M, also called the fiber of the tangent bundle over the point
p ∈ M.
The differentiable structure of M naturally induces one of T M, turning this set
into a differentiable manifold. Note first that each chart (U, h) of M with coor−1
dinates {x i } defines a natural bundle chart with domain T U = πM
(U ) and the
2n
following mapping T h : T U −→ R . The image of v ∈ Tp M, with v = v i ∂i , is the
point x 1 (p), . . . , x n (p), v 1 , . . . , v n in R2n . If this is done for each chart of an atlas
of M, it is easy to see that the corresponding set of natural bundle charts satisfies the
conditions in the Remarks at the end of Chap. 11, and thus defines a differentiable
structure (and a unique Hausdorff topology) of T M. Moreover, πM is then a smooth
map.

16.3

Vector Fields Along Maps

671

If φ : M −→ N is a smooth map between two differentiable manifolds, then T φ :
T M −→ T N denotes the mapping v ∈ Tp M −→ Tp φ · v ∈ Tφ(p) N . The following
diagram is commutative

Moreover, we have the chain rule
T (ψ ◦ φ) = T ψ ◦ T φ.

(16.7)

It should also be clear that a differentiable vector field X ∈ X (M) can equivalently
be defined as a smooth map X : M −→ T M such that the diagram

is commutative: πM ◦ X = id. Such maps are also called smooth sections of the
tangent bundle.

16.3 Vector Fields Along Maps
We now use this convenient language to generalize the notion of vector fields.
Definition 16.2 Let φ : N −→ M be a smooth mapping. A vector field along φ is a
smooth map A : N −→ T M such that the following diagram is commutative.

The set X (φ) of such vector fields is naturally a module over F(N ): For A ∈
X (φ) and f ∈ F(N ) we define f A by (f A)(p) = f (p)A(p). X (φ) is also an
F(M)-module: If g ∈ F(M) then g ◦ φ ∈ F(N ) and thus (g ◦ φ)A ∈ X (φ). Each
vector field Y ∈ X (M) defines the vector field Y ◦ φ ∈ X (φ).
Special vector fields along φ are of the form
A = T φ ◦ A ,

A ∈ X (N ),

called tangential vector fields along φ (see Fig. 16.1). We denote the set of such
fields by X (φ)T .
For two tangential vector fields A = T φ ◦ A and B = T φ ◦ B  we define the
bracket naturally by
[A, B] = T φ ◦ A , B  .

(16.9)

This is again tangential. A coordinate expression is given in (16.13) below.
In practice N is often a subset of R2 (see Sect. 16.4). Commuting tangential
vector fields are then given by the partial derivatives in R2 .

16.3.1 Induced Covariant Derivative
Let now ∇ be a connection on M. We show below that this defines an associated
covariant derivative ∇˜ of vector fields along φ in the direction of tangential vector
fields along φ.
Proposition 16.3 Let φ : N −→ M be a smooth map and ∇ an affine connection
on M. Then there is a unique map
∇˜ : X (φ)T × X (φ) −→ X (φ),
(A, X) −→ ∇˜ A X,
such that the following equations are valid:
(i) ∇˜ A+B X = ∇˜ A X + ∇˜ B X;
(ii) ∇˜ f A X = f ∇˜ A X with f ∈ F(N );
(iii) ∇˜ A (X + Y ) = ∇˜ A X + ∇˜ A Y ;
(iv) ∇˜ A (f X) = f ∇˜ A X + (A f )X for A = T φ ◦ A and f ∈ F(N );
(v) For the special case X = Y ◦ φ, Y ∈ X (M) the following holds
∇˜ A (Y ◦ φ) = (∇A Y ) ◦ φ,
where ((∇A Y ) ◦ φ)(p) = ∇A(p) Y ∈ Tφ(p) M is the covariant derivative (in M)
of Y in the direction A(p).

The right-hand side is of this equation is uniquely determined by ∇.
Next, we show the existence. Conversely, define ∇˜ A by Eq. (16.10) for U ⊂ M,
such that φ(U ) is in the domain of a chart of M. A direct calculation shows, that
all five properties of the Proposition 16.3 are satisfied. Because of the uniqueness of
the local definition of ∇˜ A X, a vector field in X (φ) is defined.

Definition 16.3 For X and Y ∈ X (φ) we define the torsion T̃ along φ by
T̃ (X, Y )(p) = T (Xp , Yp ). The right-hand side is well-defined since the torsion T
of ∇ is a tensor field. Correspondingly, we define the curvature R̃(X, Y )Z along φ,
for X, Y, Z ∈ X (φ).
As expected, the following holds

Consider variations with fixed ends and require that for all such variations the
first variation of the energy functional (left-hand side of (16.18)) vanishes, then the
curve c is a geodesic, ∇ċ ċ = 0, because Y vanishes at the ends, and is otherwise
arbitrary. Note that instead of E(ct ) one can use the length functional L(ct ).

16.4.2 Jacobi Equation
With the previous notation, we now assume that the curves ct are all geodesics and
investigate the propagation of Y along c. Consider the second derivative
∇˜ T2 V = ∇˜ T (∇˜ T V ) = ∇˜ T (∇˜ V T )
= ∇˜ V (∇˜ T T ) + R̃(T , V )T = R̃(T , V )T ,
where we have also used ∇˜ T T = 0. For t = 0 we obtain the Jacobi equation
∇ċ2 Y = R(ċ, Y )ċ,

(16.19)

which is a second order linear differential equation for Y . A field satisfying this
equation is a Jacobi field along c.
The Jacobi equation is important both in mathematics and physics. Jacobi fields
are used in the celebrated Morse theory (see, e.g., [48]). We use the Jacobi equation
(equation for geodesic deviation) in Chap. 3 (Sect. 3.1) to interpret tidal forces in
terms of the curvature of spacetime.

Appendix A

Fundamental Equations for Hypersurfaces

In this appendix we consider submanifolds with codimension 1 of a pseudoRiemannian manifold and derive, among other things, the important equations of
Gauss and Codazzi–Mainardi. These have many useful applications, in particular
for 3 + 1 splittings of Einstein’s equations (see Sect. 3.9).
For definiteness, we consider a spacelike hypersurface Σ of a Lorentz manifold
(M, g). Other situations, e.g., timelike hypersurfaces can be treated in the same way,
with sign changes here and there. The formulation can also be generalized to submanifolds of codimension larger than 1 of arbitrary pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
(see, for instance, [51]), a situation that occurs for instance in string theory.
Let ι : Σ −→ M denote the embedding and let ḡ = ι∗ g be the induced metric
on Σ. The pair (Σ, ḡ) is a three-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Other quantities which belong to Σ will often be indicated by a bar. The basic results of this
appendix are most efficiently derived with the help of adapted moving frames and
the structure equations of Cartan. So let {eμ } be an orthonormal frame on an open
region of M, with the property that the ei , for i = 1, 2, 3, at points of Σ are tangent
to Σ . The dual basis of {eμ } is denoted by {θ μ }. On Σ the {ei } can be regarded as a
triad of Σ that is dual to the restrictions θ̄ i := θ j |T Σ (i.e., the restrictions to tangent
vectors of Σ ). Indices for objects on Σ always refer to this pair of dual basis.

A.1 Formulas of Gauss and Weingarten
Consider the restriction of the first structure equation
dθ μ + ωμν ∧ θ ν = 0

(A.1)

to T Σ . Since θ 0 |T Σ = 0 we obtain
d θ̄ i + ωij ∧ θ̄ j = 0 on T Σ,

ω0k ∧ θ̄ k = 0 on T Σ.

A Fundamental Equations for Hypersurfaces

Because the connection forms ω̄ij of (Σ, ḡ) also satisfy (A.2a), and have the same
symmetry properties, we conclude (see Sect. 15.7) that
ω̄ij = ωij

on T Σ.

(A.3)

This has a simple geometrical meaning. Let ∇ be the Levi-Civitaà connection on
(M, g) and ∇¯ that of (Σ, ḡ), then we get from (A.3)
∇X ej , ei  = ωij (X) = ω̄ij (X) = ∇¯ X ej , ei 

(A.4)

for X ∈ T Σ. This shows that for any X ∈ T Σ and any vector field Y of M tangent
to Σ , the tangential projection of ∇X Y on T Σ ⊂ T M is equal to ∇¯ X Y .
From (A.2b) we obtain information about the component of ∇X Y normal to T Σ .
This equation tells us that the ω0i = ωi0 satisfy the hypothesis of the following
Lemma A.1 (Cartan) If α 1 , . . . , α n are linearly independent 1-forms on a manifold
M of dimension n ≥ n, and β1 , . . . , βn are one forms on M satisfying

then there are smooth functions fij on M such that
βi =

fij α j ;

(A.6)

j =1

moreover
fij = fj i .

(A.7)


Proof In a neighborhood of any point we can choose 1-forms α n+1 , . . . , α n so that

α 1 , . . . , α n are everywhere linearly independent. Then there are smooth functions
fij (i ≤ n, j ≤ n ) with

βi =

Since the α i ∧ α j for i < j are linearly independent, we conclude fij = fj i for
i, j ≤ n and fij = 0 for j > n.

A.2 Equations of Gauss and Codazzi–Mainardi

681

According to the lemma and (A.2b) there are functions Kij on Σ such that
ω0i = −Kij θ j

on T Σ,

(A.8a)

Kij = Kj i .

(A.8b)

From this and ∇eμ eν = ωλν (eμ )eλ we obtain
∇ei ej , e0  = −ω0j (ei ) = Kij = Kj i = ∇ej ei , e0 .

(A.9)

So the bilinear form K(X, Y ) on T Σ belonging to Kij gives the normal component
of ∇X Y :
∇X Y = ∇¯ X Y − K(X, Y )N

(A.10)

for X ∈ T Σ , Y ∈ X (M) tangent to Σ, where N = e0 (normalized normal vector on
Σ, N, N = −1).
Equation (A.10) is the Gauss formula. The symmetric bilinear form K, called
the second fundamental form or extrinsic curvature, satisfies according to (A.9) the
Weingarten equations
K(X, Y ) = N, ∇X Y  = −∇X N, Y .

(A.11)

Remarks The reader should be warned that some authors use as extrinsic curvature
the negative of our K. The linear transformation of the tangent spaces of Σ corresponding to K is known as the Weingarten map of the second fundamental tensor.
Its real eigenvalues are called principal curvatures.

μ

Next, we look for relations between the curvature forms Ω ν and Ω̄ ij of (M, g),
respectively (Σ, ḡ). For this we restrict the second structure equation

Ω ij = dωij + ωik ∧ ωkj + ωi0 ∧ ω0j
to T Σ. Using (A.3) and (A.8a) this gives
Ω ij = Ω̄ ij + K ik Kj l θ̄ k ∧ θ̄ l

on T Σ.

For the other components we obtain on T Σ


Ω 0j = dω0j + ω0i ∧ ωij = −d Kij θ̄ i − Kik θ̄ k ∧ ω̄ij
= −dKij ∧ θ̄ i − Kij d θ̄ i − Kik θ̄ k ∧ ω̄ij
or, using the first structure equation on (Σ, ḡ),

Here D̄ denotes the absolute exterior differential of the tensor field K.
The relations (A.13) and (A.14) are the famous equations of Gauss and Codazzi–
Mainardi in terms of differential forms. We want to rewrite them in a more useful
form. Consider for tangential X, Y

This shows that for tangent vectors X, Y, Z and W of Σ we have


R(X, Y )Z, W = R̄(X, Y )Z, W
− K(X, Z)K(Y, W ) + K(Y, Z)K(X, W ).

(A.15)

One often calls this relation Gauss’ Theorema Egregium. (Note that some of the
signs are different from the ones for the Riemannian case, that is usually treated in
mathematics books.)
Similarly, we obtain from (A.14)

the Codazzi–Mainardi equation:

This form of Gauss’ equation is particularly useful in GR.
Consider, for illustration, a static metric as in Sect. 3.1. From (3.23) we see that
the second fundamental form for any time slice vanishes, thus (A.21) gives
1
G00 = Gμν N μ N ν = R̄,

in agreement with (3.30). In the exercises we consider time-dependent metrics.
These formulas simplify if Σ is totally geodesic in the sense of
Definition A.1 A hypersurface Σ is called totally geodesic if every geodesic γ (s)
of (M, g) with γ (0) ∈ Σ and γ̇ (0) ∈ Tγ (0) Σ remains in Σ for s in some open
interval (−ε, ε).
This is equivalent to the property that ∇X Y is tangent to Σ whenever X and Y
are (see Exercise A.3). From (A.10) we conclude that Σ ⊂ M is totally geodesic if
and only if the second fundamental form K of Σ vanishes.

A Fundamental Equations for Hypersurfaces

A.3 Null Hypersurfaces
Null hypersurfaces of Lorentz manifolds play an important role in GR.
Definition A.2 A hypersurface Σ of a Lorentz manifold (M, g) is null, if the induced metric on Σ is degenerate.
The reader may easily show that this is equivalent to the property that at any
point p ∈ Σ there exists a non-vanishing null vector in Tp M which is perpendicular
to Tp Σ (see property (d) in Exercise 8.5). As a consequence of property (c) in the
same Exercise, this null vector is unique up to a scale factor (up to a positive scale
factor if the null vector is future directed). Hence, there exists locally a smooth nonvanishing null vector field l along Σ which is tangent to Σ and whose normal space
at any point p ∈ Σ coincides with Tp M. From the quoted exercise it also follows
that tangent vectors of Σ not parallel to l are spacelike.
The null vector field l, which is unique up to rescaling, has the following remarkable property:
Proposition A.1 The integral curves of l, when suitably parameterized, are null
geodesics.
Proof We show below that ∇l l is at each p ∈ Σ perpendicular to Tp M. This implies
that ∇l l is proportional to l, which is equivalent to the proposition.
To establish the stated property, let u ∈ Tp M and extend u locally to a vector field
along Σ which is invariant under the flow belonging to l (show that this is possible).
Then 0 = Ll u = [l, u] = ∇l u − ∇u l. From l, u = 0 we obtain
0 = ll, u = ∇l l, u + l, ∇l u,
thus
1
∇l l, u = −l, ∇u l = − ul, l = 0.
2
(These formulas should be interpreted in the sense of Sect. 16.3 for vector fields
along the embedding map of Σ into M.) Since u is arbitrary in p, ∇l l is indeed

perpendicular to Tp Σ .
The integral curves of l are called null geodesic generators of Σ.

Exercise A.3 Prove that a hypersurface Σ of (M, g) is totally geodesic if and only
if ∇X Y is tangent to Σ whenever X and Y are.
Solution We already know that the second property holds if and only if the second
fundamental form K of Σ vanishes. So let us show that K = 0 if and only if Σ is
totally geodesic.
Let γ : s −→ γ (s) be a geodesic in (M, g), with γ (0) ∈ Σ, γ̇ (0) ∈ Tγ (0) Σ , and
let γ̄ be a geodesic in (Σ, ḡ) with the same initial conditions. From (A.10) we get
∇γ̄˙ γ̄˙ = ∇¯ γ̄˙ γ̄˙ − K(γ̄˙ , γ̄˙ )N = −K(γ̄˙ , γ̄˙ )N.

686

A Fundamental Equations for Hypersurfaces

Hence, if K vanishes we see that γ̄ is also a geodesic of (M, g) with the same initial
conditions as γ , thus γ̄ = γ on their common domain. This proves that a vanishing
K implies that Σ is totally geodesic.
Conversely, let Σ be totally geodesic. Then γ stays in Σ for some open interval
(−ε, ε). From (A.10) we now conclude
0 = ∇γ̇ γ̇ = ∇¯ γ̇ γ̇ − K(γ̇ , γ̇ )N.
Therefore, ∇¯ γ̇ γ̇ = 0 and K(γ̇ , γ̇ ) = 0. In particular, γ is also a geodesic of (Σ, ḡ).
Moreover, since γ (0) ∈ Σ and γ̇ (0) ∈ Tγ (0) Σ are arbitrary, we conclude that K = 0
(use the symmetry of K and polarization).

Appendix B

Ricci Curvature of Warped Products

In GR one often encounters so-called warped products (see Appendix of Chap. 4).
By definition, a pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M, g) is a warped product of two
pseudo-Riemannian manifolds (M̃, g̃) and (S, ĝ) with an everywhere positive warp
function f : M̃ −→ R, written as
M = M̃ ×f S,

(B.1)

if M is the product manifold M̃ × S and the metric has the form
g = π ∗ (g̃) + (f ◦ π)2 σ ∗ (ĝ),

(B.2)

where π and σ are the projections from M onto M̃ and S, respectively. In the following we shall drop the pull-backs π ∗ , σ ∗ .
The calculation of the curvature quantities of (M, g) in terms of those of (M̃, g̃)
and (S, ĝ) is best done within the framework of Cartan’s calculus. We shall work
with the orthonormal tetrad fields {θ α } of (M, g), which are adapted as follows: Let
α = (a, A) and let
θ a = θ̃ a ,

θ A = f θ̂ A ,

(B.3)

where θ̃ a , for a = 1, . . . , dim(M̃), and θ̂ A , for A = dim(M̃) + 1, . . . , dim(M), are
orthonormal bases of (M̃, g̃) and (S, ĝ), respectively. The connection forms of the
various spaces are denoted by ωαβ , ω̃ab and ω̂AB , and for the corresponding curvature
forms we use the symbols Ω αβ , Ω̃ ab and Ω̂ AB .
To start, we determine the connection forms ωαβ from Cartan’s first structure
equation
dθ α + ωαβ ∧ θ β = 0.

the warp function is the scale factor a(t). The spacetime metric is thus

Appendix C

Frobenius Integrability Theorem

In this appendix we develop an important differential geometric tool of GR that is
also one of the pillars of differential topology and the calculus on manifolds. The
following problem is a natural generalization of finding integral curves for a vector
field. Instead of a vector field we assign to each point p of a manifold M a subspace
Ep of Tp M which depends on p in a smooth manner and ask: When is it possible
to find for each point p0 ∈ M a submanifold N with p0 ∈ N , which is tangent
to Ep , i.e., such that Tp N = Ep for each point p ∈ N ? In general, such integral
manifolds do not exist, even locally. For the local problem the so-called Frobenius
theorem (due to A. Clebsch and F. Deahna) gives necessary and sufficient criteria
for integral manifolds to exist.
We begin with some definitions.
Definition C.1 A k-dimensional distribution (k-plane, k-direction field) on M
is a map p −→ Ep , where Ep is a k-dimensional subspace of Tp M. We call
this distribution smooth if the following condition is satisfied: For each p0 ∈ M
there is a neighborhood V and k differentiable vector fields X1 , . . . , Xk such that
X1 (p), . . . , Xk (p) form a basis of Ep for all p ∈ V .
Definition C.2 A k-dimensional submanifold N of M is called an integral manifold
of the distribution E if for every p ∈ N we have
Tp ι · Tp N = E p ,
where ι : N '→ M is the inclusion map. We say that the distribution E on M is
integrable if, through each p ∈ M, there passes an integral manifold of E.
We want to find out when E is integrable. For this we consider vector fields
which belong to E: We say that the vector field X belongs to E if Xp ∈ Ep for
all p. Suppose now that N is an integrable manifold of E, and ι : N '→ M is the
inclusion map. If X, Y are two vector fields which belong to E, then for all p ∈ N

C Frobenius Integrability Theorem

there are unique X̄p , Ȳp ∈ Tp N such that
Xp = Tp ι · X̄p ,

Yp = Tp ι · Ȳp .

It is not difficult to show1 that the vector fields X̄, Ȳ are C ∞ . In other words X̄ and
X, as well as Ȳ and Y , are ι-related. Then we know (Theorem 13.6) that [X̄, Ȳ ] and
[X, Y ] are ι-related. Thus
Tp ι · [X̄, Ȳ ]p = [X, Y ]p .
Since [X̄, Ȳ ]p ∈ Tp N we conclude that [X, Y ]p ∈ Ep . We thus have shown: If E is
integrable then [X, Y ] also belongs to E. This suggests to introduce the following
concept:
Definition C.3 We say that the k-distribution E on M is involutive if [X, Y ] belongs
to E whenever the vector fields X and Y (defined on open sets of M) belong to E.
Using this terminology, we have shown that if E is integrable then E is involutive. It turns out that the reverse is also true.
Theorem C.1 (Frobenius’ Theorem (first version)) Let E be a C ∞ k-dimensional
distribution on M which is involutive. Then E is integrable. More precisely the following holds: For each point p ∈ M there is a coordinate system {x 1 , . . . , x n } in a
neighborhood U of p with
x i (p) = 0,

x i (U ) ⊂ (−ε, ε)

(ε > 0),

such that for each (a k+1 , . . . , a n ) with all |a i | < ε the set


q ∈ U : x k+1 (q) = a k+1 , . . . , x n (q) = a n
is an integral manifold of E. Any connected integral manifold of E restricted to U
is contained in one of these sets.
We postpone the proof of this important theorem and first reformulate it in a
useful manner in terms of differential forms. For this we need some concepts.
2
To each k-dimensional distribution E we associate the set I(E) ⊂ (M) of dif2l
l
ferential forms
- ωl with the property that each homogeneous component ω ∈ (M)
of ω (ω = l ω ) annihilates the sets (X1 , . . . , Xl ) of vector fields belonging to E:
ωl (X1 , . . . , Xl ) = 0.
The set I(E) is called the annihilator of E. Clearly, I(E) is an ideal of the algebra
2
(M) of exterior forms: With ω1 , ω2 ∈ I(E) the sum ω1 + ω2 also belongs to E,
1 Since ι is an immersion one can use coordinates as in Definition 11.7. For details, see [50], p. 258.

and η ∧ ω ∈ I(E) if ω ∈ I(E) and η ∈ (M). Locally, the ideal I(E) is generated
by n − k independent 1-forms ωk+1 , . . . , ωn . In fact, around each point p ∈ M we
can choose coordinates {x i } so that {∂1 |p , . . . , ∂k |p } span Ep . Then dx 1 (p) ∧ . . . ∧
dx k (p) is non-zero on Ep and by continuity also in a small neighborhood of p. This
implies that {dx 1 (q), . . . , dx k (q)} are linearly independent in Eq . Therefore, if we
restrict dx α (q) for α = k + 1, . . . , n to Eq we have the expansion
dx (q) =

are linearly independent 1-forms which belong to I(E). These generate the ideal. To
show this we complete ωk+1 , . . . , ωn to a basis ω1 , . . . , ωn of 1-forms and consider
the dual basis X1 , . . . , Xn of vector fields. Then X1 , . . . , Xk span the k-dimensional
distribution E. Suppose an l-form ω ∈ I(E) contains in the expansion with respect
to the basis ω1 , . . . , ωn ,

a term cj1 ...jl ωj1 ∧ . . . ∧ ωjl which contains no factor from ωk+1 , . . . , ωn . Then we
have ω(Xj1 , . . . , Xjl ) = 0, in contradiction to ω ∈ I(E). This proves:
2
Proposition C.1 Let I(E) be the ideal of (M) belonging to the k-dimensional
distribution E. Then I(E) is locally generated by n − k independent 1-forms: For
each point of M there is a neighborhood U and n−k pointwise linearly independent

1-forms ωk+1 , . . . , ωn ∈ 1 (U ) such that for each ω ∈ I(E)
ω|U =

for some θi ∈

(U ).

Now we can reformulate the condition in the Frobenius theorem.
Proposition C.2 A distribution E on M is involutive if and only if I(E) is a differential ideal: dI(E) ⊂ I(E).

694

C Frobenius Integrability Theorem

Proof We use the same notation as above. It is easy to see that E is involutive if and
only if there exist smooth functions C lij such that
[Xi , Xj ] =

for i, j = 1, . . . , k. Now we have (see (14.16))


dωα (Xi , Xj ) = Xi ωα (Xj ) − Xj ωα (Xi ) − ωα [Xi , Xj ] .
For 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k and α > k the first two terms on the right vanish. So dωα (Xi , Xj ) =
0 if and only if ωα ([Xi , Xj ]) = 0. But the latter equation holds for all i, j if and only
if each [Xi , Xj ] belongs to E (i.e., if E is involutive), while dωα (Xi , Xj ) = 0 holds
exactly when dωα ∈ I(E).

Next we establish some equivalent conditions that a locally (finitely) generated
ideal is a differential ideal.
2
Proposition C.3 Let I be an ideal of (M) locally generated by n − k linearly
2
2
independent forms ωk+1 , . . . , ωn ∈ 1 (U ). Furthermore let ω ∈ n−k (U ) be the
form ω = ωk+1 ∧ . . . ∧ ωn . Then the following statements are equivalent:
(i) I is an differential ideal.
2
(ii) dωα = nβ=k+1 ωαβ ∧ ωβ for certain ωαβ ∈ 1 (U ).
(iii) ω ∧ dωα = 0 for2
α = k + 1, . . . , n.
(iv) There exists θ ∈ 1 (U ) such that dω = θ ∧ ω.
Proof The equivalence of (i) and (iii) follows immediately from the definitions. The
same is true for the implication (i) =⇒ (iv). For the proof of (iv) =⇒ (iii) note that
the condition (iv) means that
n
!

(−1)α dωα ∧ ωk+1 ∧ . . . ∧ ω̂α ∧ . . . ∧ ωn = θ ∧ ωk+1 ∧ . . . ∧ ωn .

α=k+1

Multiplying this equation with ωα we get
2 (iii). It remains to show that (iii) =⇒
(ii): Again, let ω1 , . . . , ωn be a basis of 1 (U ) such that ωk+1 , . . . , ωn generate I
over U . Then
!
dωi =
f ji l ωj ∧ ωl ,
(C.1)
j <l

where f ji l ∈ F(U ). But

1≤j <l≤k

f jαl ωj ∧ ωl ∧ ωk+1 ∧ . . . ∧ ωn .

C.1 Applications

695

Thus f jαl = 0 for α = k + 1, . . . , n and 1 ≤ j < l ≤ k. Hence the sum in (C.1) is of
the form (ii).

Now we assemble the preceding results in the following version of the Frobenius
theorem.
Theorem C.2 (Frobenius’ Theorem) Let M be an n-dimensional manifold and E
a k-dimensional distribution on M, and I(E) the associated ideal. The following
statements are all equivalent:
(i) E is integrable.
(ii) E is involutive.
(iii) I(E) is a differential ideal
2 locally generated by n − k linearly independent
1-forms ωk+1 , . . . , ωn ∈ 1 (U ).
2
(iv) For every point of M there is a neighborhood U and ωk+1 , . . . , ωn ∈ 1 (U )
generating I(E) such that

for certain ωαβ ∈

(U ).

(v)
dωα ∧ ωk+1 ∧ . . . ∧ ωn = 0

(C.3)

(in the notation of 2
(iv)).
(vi) There exists a θ ∈ 1 (U ) such that
dω = θ ∧ ω,

ω := ωk+1 ∧ . . . ∧ ωn .

(C.4)

C.1 Applications
Consider first a single timelike vector field X on a Lorentz manifold (M, g). The orthogonal complement of Xp in every Tp (M) defines a 3-dimensional distribution E.
Obviously, X is hypersurface orthogonal if and only if E is integrable. Since ω = X 
generates the ideal I(E) the Frobenius theorem tells us that E is integrable if and
only if
ω ∧ dω = 0.

(C.5)

(We have used the equivalence of (i) and (v).) This shows that (C.5) is necessary
and sufficient for X being locally hypersurface orthogonal.
Our main application in GR will be the introduction of adapted coordinates if
there are several Killing fields on (M, g), in particular, if there exist two commuting
Killing fields. Let us, however, first introduce adapted coordinates for more general
situations.

696

C Frobenius Integrability Theorem

Let again, for a k-dimensional distribution E, E|U = span{X1 , . . . , Xk } and
ωk+1 , . . . , ωn the generating 1-forms of the ideal I(E). We use the following notation: Indices running from 1, 2, . . . , n are denoted by Greek letters; for the first
k numbers we use small Latin letters, while for indices with values k + 1, . . . , n
capital letters will be used.
Assume that E is involutive and use adapted coordinates {x μ } as in the first
version of the Frobenius theorem. The (local) integral manifolds are given by {x A =
const}. For the basis of vector fields Xa belonging to E we have


Since ωA , Xa  = 0 we obtain, setting ωA = ωAμ dx μ ,


0 = Xab ωAμ dx μ , ∂b = Xab ωAb = 0
for all a = 1, . . . , k. Hence ωAb = 0 and thus
ωA = ωAB dx B .

(C.7)

Clearly, the matrices (Xab ) and (ωAB ) are non-singular.
Let us specialize this to commuting fields Xa . We show that one can then choose
adapted coordinates such that
Xa =

∂
∂x a

(a = 1, . . . , k).

(C.8)

To prove this, consider the flows φta of Xa . We know that these commute (Theorem 13.10). Now choose the coordinates x a for a point p of an integral manifold
{x A = const} according to


p = φx11 ◦ . . . ◦ φxkk (p0 ),
where p0 is a fixed “origin”. With this choice the representation (C.8) obviously
holds.
Returning to the general case we assume now that M has a distinguished pseudoRiemannian metric g. Keeping the previous notation we can then also introduce

the 1-forms ωa = Xa . These generate an ideal, denoted by I(E ⊥ ), which is the
annihilator of a distribution E ⊥ . Let E ⊥ be spanned by the vector fields XA , E ⊥ =
span{XA }. Then we have

 a
(C.9)
ω , XA = 0 ⇐⇒ g(Xa , XA ) = 0 : E ⊥ E ⊥ .
In what follows we assume that the restrictions g|E and g|E ⊥ are non-singular.
Then E ∩ E ⊥ = {0}, so
Tp M = Ep ⊕ Ep⊥ .

(C.10)

Dually we have

 

Tp∗ M = span ωa ⊕⊥ span ωA ,

(C.11)



where ωA = XA . We have thus constructed a basis of vector fields {Xμ } and the

basis {ωμ = Xμ } of 1-forms such that {ωA } generates the ideal I(E), and {ωa } the
⊥
ideal I(E ).
Let us now assume that E and E ⊥ are involutive. We use coordinates {uμ } which
are adapted to E and also coordinates {v μ } that are adapted to E ⊥ . Then we have
according to (C.6) and (C.7)

ωA = ωAB duB ,
(C.12a)
Xa uA = 0,
 a
a

b
ω = ω b dv .
(C.12b)
XA v = 0,
Now we define coordinates {x μ } by
x a = va ,

x A = uA .

(C.13)

The x μ indeed form a coordinate system. For this we have to show that the dx μ are
linearly independent. Suppose there would be a linear dependence
fa dx a = gA dx A ,
i.e., fa dv a = gA duA , then applying this to Xc leads to



 
fa dv a , Xc = gA duA , Xc = gA Xc uA = 0,
i.e., dv a , fa Xc  = 0 or, by (C.12b), ωa , fa Xc  = 0. Thus fa Xc ∈ E ∩ E ⊥ , whence
fa Xc = 0 thus fa = 0, implying gA = 0.
The coordinates {x μ } have, as a result of (C.12a) and (C.12b), the following
properties:
(i) Xa (x A ) = 0,
(ii) gaA = 0.
The last property is obtained as follows: Let ωa = ωaμ dx μ and use (C.12b) to conclude that ωaA = 0. But by (i)
ωaA = gAμ X μa = gAb X ba .
Summarizing, we have the result:
Proposition C.4 Let E = span{X1 , . . . , Xk } be a k-dimensional distribution which

is involutive. Assume in addition that the ideal generated by {ωa = Xa } is differen⊥
tial. If this is the annihilator of E , then under the assumption that E ∩ E ⊥ = {0}
we can introduce coordinates {x μ } with (μ = (a, A))
 
gaA = 0,
(C.14)
Xa x A = 0.

698

C Frobenius Integrability Theorem

Assume next, that the generating vector fields X1 , . . . , Xk in this Proposition are
Killing fields, LXa g = 0. In adapted coordinates this becomes
X ba gμν,b + gbν X ba,μ + gμb X ba,ν = 0.

(C.15)

If we apply this for μ = A, ν = B, and use (C.14), we obtain gAB,b = 0. Thus gAB
depends only on x C . Choosing, on the other hand, μ = A, ν = c in (C.15) we obtain
X ba gAc,b + gbc X ba,A + gAb X ba,c = 0.

(C.16)

Since gaA = 0 the first and the last term vanish, and we conclude that X ba,A = 0.
Thus X ba depends only on x c . Summarizing, we have the useful
Proposition C.5 If in addition to the assumptions of the Proposition C.4 it is assumed that Xa are Killing fields of the pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M, g), then
there are local coordinates {x μ } such that (in the notation introduced above)
 
 
(C.17a)
g = gab x μ dx a dx b + gAB x C dx A dx B ,
Xa = X ba ∂b ,

(C.17b)

where X ba are only functions of x c .
Note, as a result of this, that the metric gab dx a dx b on the integral manifolds
A
{x = const} has k Killing fields Xa , whence this submanifolds are homogeneous
spaces.
Finally, we consider the important special case when the Killing fields Xa commute. We can then choose the adapted coordinates such that (C.8) holds. If we use
this in (C.15) for μ = c, ν = d, we get
X ba gcd,b + gbd X ba,c + 0 = 0.
Since the second term vanishes we see that gcd,b = 0. Hence gcd depends only on
x A . In this special case we can, therefore, find coordinates x μ such that

where (t 1 , . . . , t n ) are the standard coordinates of Rn . Let π : Rn −→ Rk be the projection (t 1 , . . . , t n ) → (t 1 , . . . , t k ). The corresponding tangential map dπ (= T π )
maps E0 isomorphically on T0 Rk . By continuity, dπ is bijective on Eq for q near 0.
So near 0, we can choose unique X1 (q), . . . , Xk (q) ∈ Eq so that
dπ · Xi (q) =

∂
∂t i π(q)

(i = 1, . . . , k).

(C.20)

Then (on a neighborhood U of 0 ∈ Rn ) the vector fields Xi and ∂t∂ i (on Rk ) are
π -related. This then also holds for their Lie brackets:

Since E was assumed to be involutive, we have [Xi , Xj ]q ∈ Eq , thus with (C.21)
[Xi , Xj ] = 0 (dπ is on Eq injective). According to the proof of (C.8) we can find
coordinates {x i } such that

(C.22)

The sets {q ∈ U | x k+1 (q) = a k+1 , . . . , x n (q) = a n } are then obviously integral
manifolds of E, since their tangent spaces are spanned by (C.22).
Conversely, if N is a connected integral manifold restricted to U , with the inclusion ι : N '→ U , then we have for x α ◦ ι with α = k + 1, . . . , n and Xq ∈ Tq N :


 


d x α ◦ ι (Xq ) = Xq x α ◦ ι = dι · Xq x α = 0,
since dι · Xq ∈ Eq , which is spanned by the vectors (C.22) taken in q. Thus d(x α ◦
ι) = 0, implying that x α ◦ ι is constant on the connected manifold N .

Exercise C.1 Consider a 1-form ω on an open set U ⊂ Rn . Use the Frobenius Theorem to show that the (n − 1)-distribution E = {v ∈ T U | ω(v) = 0} is integrable if

ω = g df.

(C.23)

The smooth function g is called an integrating factor.
Since by the Frobenius Theorem integrability is equivalent to
ω ∧ dω = 0,

(C.24)

we see that (C.24) is necessary and sufficient for the existence of an integrating factor. Note that (C.24) is always satisfied for n = 2, so that ω has always an integrating

C Frobenius Integrability Theorem

Solution If (C.23) is satisfied, then {f = const} are integral manifolds of E. Conversely, if E is integrable then according to the first version of the Frobenius theorem, the integral manifolds of E are given by {f = const} for a smooth function, so
that df annihilates E. Thus the ideal I(E) generated by ω is also generated by df ,
whence ω = g df for some smooth function g on U .

Collection of Important Formulas

The following list summarizes some of the important formulas which have been
obtained in the foregoing chapters and will constantly be used throughout this book.

D.1 Vector Fields, Lie Brackets
The set of smooth vector fields X (M) on a manifold M with the commutator product [X, Y ] form a R-Lie algebra and a module over the associative algebra F(M) of
C ∞ -functions. In local coordinates we have
X = ξi

∂x j

Under a diffeomorphism ϕ ∈ Diff(M) the Lie bracket transforms naturally:
ϕ∗ [X, Y ] = [ϕ∗ X, ϕ∗ Y ].

D.2 Differential Forms
2
The differential forms (M) 2
on M form a real associative algebra with the exterior
product ∧ as multiplication; p (M) denotes the F(M)-module of p-forms. The
exterior product satisfies,
α ∧ β = (−1)kl β ∧ α,

α∈

k
l

(M), β ∈ (M).

For a differentiable map ϕ,
ϕ ∗ (α ∧ β) = ϕ ∗ α ∧ ϕ ∗ β.

For a map ϕ,
ϕ ∗ dα = dϕ ∗ α

D.4 Poincaré Lemma
If dα = 0, then α is locally exact; that is, there is a neighborhood U of every x ∈ M
on which α = dβ.

D.5 Interior Product
The interior product iX is an antiderivation of degree −1; in particular
iX (α ∧ β) = (iX α) ∧ β + (−1)p α ∧ iX β,

(M), β ∈ (M).

We obviously have
if X α = f iX α = iX f α,

for f ∈ F(M),

and
iX ◦ iX = 0.
For a diffeomorphism ϕ (see Exercise D.1),
ϕ ∗ iX α = iϕ ∗ X ϕ ∗ α.

D.6 Lie Derivative
The Lie derivative LX with respect to the vector field X is a derivation of degree 0 of
the tensor algebra T (M); it is R-linear in X. For a diffeomorphism ϕ and T ∈ T (M)

D.7 Relations Between LX , iX and d

LX α = diX α + iX dα,

(Cartan’s formula)

Lf X α = f LX α + df ∧ iX α,
L[X,Y ] = [LX , LY ] = LX ◦ LY − LY ◦ LX ,
i[X,Y ] = [LX , iY ] = LX ◦ iY − iY ◦ LX ,
LX ◦ d = d ◦ L X ,
LX ◦ iX = iX ◦ LX .

D.8 Volume Form
For an oriented n-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M, g), with θ 1 , . . . ,
θ n an oriented basis of one-forms, the canonical volume form can be represented as

η = |g|θ 1 ∧ . . . ∧ θ n , g = gik θ i ⊗ θ k , |g| = det(gik ) .

707

Exercise D.1 Let
2 ϕ : M −→ N be a differentiable mapping between the manifolds
M and N , α ∈ (N ), X ∈ X (N ), Y ∈ Y(M) such that Y and X are ϕ-related. Show
that
iY ϕ ∗ α = ϕ ∗ iX α.
In particular, if ϕ is a diffeomorphism, then
iϕ ∗ X ϕ ∗ α = ϕ ∗ iX α.
Conclude that the first equation implies
LY ϕ ∗ α = ϕ ∗ LX α.
Remarks The naturalness property of the interior product with respect to diffeomorphisms follows directly from the definitions.
